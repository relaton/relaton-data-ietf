<abstract><t>This memo introduces a new secure method to synchronize difference clocks on the Internet, assuring smoothness (i.e., frequency stability) and robustness to man-in-the-middle attacks.  This type of synchronization is useful for some kind of measurements, like traffic, load, or relative time measurements.  The "sic" proposal is highly accurate, with an MTIE (Maximum Time Interval Error) less than 25 microseconds by a minute for the 90% of the cases, and it is based on a regular packets exchange.</t></abstract>
