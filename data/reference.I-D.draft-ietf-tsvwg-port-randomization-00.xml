<abstract><t>Recently, awareness has been raised about a number of "blind" attacks that can be performed against the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and similar protocols.  The consequences of these attacks range from throughput-reduction to broken connections or data corruption.  These attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the five- tuple (Protocol, Source Address, Destination Address, Source Port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked.  This document describes a simple and efficient method for random selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced. While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods, the described port number randomization algorithms provide improved security/obfuscation with very little effort and without any key management overhead.  The mechanisms described in this document are a local modification that may be incrementally deployed, and that does not violate the specifications of any of the transport protocols that may benefit from it, such as TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP, and RTP.</t></abstract>
