<abstract><t>Most digital-signature system deployments require dedicated and solution-specific user-enrollment procedures and user-enrollment software[1], and mandate provisioning and distribution of physical or software-based signature-key tokens to end users.  As deployed such approaches create a high burden in logistics, cost, and help-desk support.  They also introduce training obstacles for users and systems administrators.  This document describes the deployment architecture approach used by ARX to provide secure and efficient digital signature services based on its CoSign(r) solution.  The security solution's deployment architecture is documented in the hope that other digital-signature and PKI deployment efforts will deliver comparable efficiencies.  [1] This is also true for deployments of non-standard proprietary  electronic signature solutions.</t></abstract>
