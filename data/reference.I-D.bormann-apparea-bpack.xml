<abstract><t>JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the representation of structured information, supporting Boolean values, numbers, strings, arrays, and tables.  Recently, a number of applications have started to look for binary representation formats that solve a similar problem.  In particular, constrained node networks can benefit from such a binary representation format.  A very successful binary representation that is otherwise comparable to JSON is MessagePack.  Recently, a number of implementations have modified or extended MessagePack such that it allows for distinguishing UTF-8 strings from binary data.  Further discussion on the MessagePack repository has resulted in proposals how to integrate such an addition back into the MessagePack community.  This draft, as an independent effort, documents one such format, tentatively calling it BinaryPack1pre2 while the MessagePack extension proposals make their way through the MessagePack community.  The current version -01 of this document is a snapshot that demonstrates a general direction.  The details may change in future versions based on the development of the MessagePack specification.</t></abstract>
