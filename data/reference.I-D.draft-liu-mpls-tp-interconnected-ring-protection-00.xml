<abstract><t>According to the ring protection Requirements in RFC 5654, Requirement 93 : When a network is constructed from interconnected rings, MPLS-TP MUST support recovery mechanisms that protect user data that traverses more than one ring.  This includes the possibility of failure of the ring-interconnect nodes and links,so this document will describle all kinds of interconnected rings Scenario and a few possible solutions for recovery the failure of the ring-interconnect nodes and Links. .  This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t></abstract>
