<abstract><t>The WiMAX forum is defining the network architecture which enables Internet connectivity to mobile stations and IP hosts via the 802.16d/e radio interface. This document specifies the addressing and operation of IPv6 for hosts served by a WiMAX network. It recommends the assignment of a unique prefix to each host and allow the host to use multiple identifiers within that prefix, including support for randomly generated identifiers. IPv6 operation in WiMAX networks as explained in this document is based entirely on existing IETF specifications. The solution entailed herein is recommended for adoption by the WiMAX forum for IPv6 over the IPv6 convergence sublayer.</t></abstract>
