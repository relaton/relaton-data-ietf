<abstract><t>The IETF has had a long tradition of doing its technical work through a consensus process, taking into account the different views among IETF participants and coming to (at least rough) consensus on technical matters.  In particular, the IETF is supposed not to be run by a "majority rules" philosophy.  This is why we engage in rituals like "humming" instead of voting.  However, more and more of our actions are now indistinguishable from voting, and quite often we are letting the majority win the day.  This document is a collection of thoughts on what rough consensus is, how we have gotten away from it, and the things we can do in order to really achieve rough consensus.</t></abstract>
