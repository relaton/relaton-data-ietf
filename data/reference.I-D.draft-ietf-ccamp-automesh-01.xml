<abstract><t>The set up of a full mesh of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) among a set of Label Switch Routers (LSR) is common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute. Such deployment may require the configuration of potentially a large number of TE LSPs (on the order of the square of the number LSRs). This document specifies IGP routing extensions for ISIS and OSPF so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh in order to automate the creation of such mesh.</t></abstract>
