<abstract><t>More and more operators have deployed or are about to deploy IPv6 transition technologies such as DS-lite, MAP, LAFT6, etc.  The fundamental elements of these technologies are Network Address Translation (NAT) and Tunneling.  The elements of these transition technologies may be subject to a number of attacks, unless appropriate mitigations are in place.  This memo discusses the security implications of the aforementioned points, and additionally, provides a number of operational mitigations that could be deployed against these attacks.</t></abstract>
