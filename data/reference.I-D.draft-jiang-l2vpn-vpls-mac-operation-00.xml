<abstract><t>The Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Signaling is described in RFC 4762. That document describes a mechanism called MAC Address Withdrawal to remove or unlearn MAC addresses which have been dynamically learned in a VPLS instance. Further work in progress defines an extension to MAC Address Withdrawal procedure which can greatly restrict the scope of MAC flushing. This document provides two mechanisms which completely remove the need for MAC address flushing in VPLS instances. The mechanisms are MAC address switching and MAC address notification.</t></abstract>
