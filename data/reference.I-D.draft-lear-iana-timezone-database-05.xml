<abstract><t>Timezone information serves as a basic protocol element in protocols, such as the calendaring suite and DHCP.  The Timezone (TZ) Database specifies the indices used in various protocols, as well as their semantic meanings, for all localities throughout the world.  This database has been meticulously maintained and distributed free of charge by a group of volunteers, coordinated by a single volunteer who is now planning to retire.  This memo specifies procedures involved with maintenance of the TZ database and associated code, including how to submit proposed updates, how decisions for inclusion of those updates are made, and the selection of a designated expert by and for the timezone community.  The intent of this memo is, to the extent possible, document existing practice and provide a means to ease succession of the database maintainers.</t></abstract>
