<abstract><t>The basic principles for the control of IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is defined in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs for both IPv4 and IPv6. These definitions are limited to networks and routers that support Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). This document extends BGP based control of IP VPNs to any IP VPN technology that use tunnels that are identified based on IP addresses rather than MPLS labels. Examples of IP tunnel technology include IP-in-IP, GRE, and IPsec tunnels. Support for IPv4 and IPv6 VPNs and tunnels are defined. It is expected that the extensions defined in this document will be most useful in environments where it is not possible to use MPLS, such as in customer provided VPNs.Contents</t></abstract>
