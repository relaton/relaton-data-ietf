<abstract><t>The need for applications using SIP to exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session establishment has been discussed.  Several approaches to transporting call control User to User Information (UUI) data in SIP have been proposed.  As networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to- end transparency.  This document discusses three mechanisms to meet the requirements defined in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUI document.  A new SIP header field which bests meets these requirements is proposed.</t></abstract>
