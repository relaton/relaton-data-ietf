<abstract><t>Hosts experiencing rapid link-layer changes may require efficient IP configuration change detection procedures than traditional fixed hosts. DNA is defined as the process by which a host collects appropriate information and detects the identity of its currently attached link to ascertain the validity of its IP configuration. This document details best current practice for Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6 hosts using existing Neighbor Discovery procedures. Since there is no explicit link identification mechanism in the existing Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6, the document describes implicit mechanisms for identifying the current link.</t></abstract>
