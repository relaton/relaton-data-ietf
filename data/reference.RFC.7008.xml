<abstract><t>This document describes the KCipher-2 encryption algorithm. KCipher-2 is a stream cipher with a 128-bit key and a 128-bit initialization vector.  Since the algorithm for KCipher-2 was published in 2007, security and efficiency have been rigorously evaluated through academic and industrial studies.  As of the publication of this document, no security vulnerabilities have been found.  KCipher-2 offers fast encryption and decryption by means of simple operations that enable efficient implementation.  KCipher-2 has been used for industrial applications, especially for mobile health monitoring and diagnostic services in Japan.</t></abstract>
