<abstract><t>The dynamic End-to-End Multisegment pseudowire setup requires PEs to maintain a pseudowire routing table when using FEC129. There is therefore a requirement for automatic Attachment Individual Identifiers discovery. Two mechanisms already exist, a BGP based solution and an IGP based one. Here we define a third solution relying on LDP. It allows for automatic discovery of the Attachment Individual Identifiers provsionned on a PE when this node does not run BGP or IGP. The mechanism described here only runs on the T-LDP (Targeted LDP) session between the T-PE and S-PE, but not on any other LDP session which may exist for the tunnels. The T-PE advertises its locally attached AIIs only for the S-PE to build its PW routing table (the S-PE does not propagate this information further via this mechanism). The mechanism described here is intended to complement other existing autodiscovery and routing mechanisms already described with BGP and OSPF.</t></abstract>
