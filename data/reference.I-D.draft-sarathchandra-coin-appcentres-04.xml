<abstract><t>The application-centric deployment of 'Internet' services has increased over the past ten years with many millions of applications providing user-centric services, executed on increasingly more powerful smartphones that are supported by Internet-based cloud services in distributed data centres, the latter mainly provided by large scale players such as Google, Amazon and alike. This draft outlines a vision for evolving those data centres towards executing app-centric micro-services; we dub this evolved data centre as an AppCentre. Complemented with the proliferation of such AppCentres at the edge of the network, they will allow for such micro-services to be distributed across many places of execution, including mobile terminals themselves, while specific micro-service chains equal today's applications in existing smartphones.</t><t> We outline the key enabling technologies that needs to be provided for such evolution to be realized, including references to ongoing standardization efforts in key areas.</t></abstract>
