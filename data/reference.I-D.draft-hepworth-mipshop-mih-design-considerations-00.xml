<abstract><t>The MIPSHOP working group is currently developing functionality to support media independent handover services, which are intended to aid IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneous wired and wireless access systems. These handover services provide a mechanism by which information such as the presence of neighbouring links and networks, and their associated characteristics, can be delivered to mobile and other network nodes for the purposes of supporting better handover decisions. A key component of the solution is the protocols that are used to deliver the various types of information to the appropriate destination node. A separate problem statement draft outlines a structure for this set of protocols as a unified set of common functions, supporting a more diverse set of application specific protocols. This draft outlines the key considerations that have to be considered when selecting or designing protocols for such common functionality.</t></abstract>
