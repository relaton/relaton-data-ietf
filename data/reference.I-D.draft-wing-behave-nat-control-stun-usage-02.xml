<abstract><t>Simple Traversal Underneath NAT (STUN) is a mechanism for traversing NATs. STUN requests are transmitted through a NAT to external STUN servers. While this works very well, its two primary drawbacks are the inability to modify the properties of a NAT binding and the need to query a public STUN server for every new NAT binding (e.g., every phone call). These drawbacks require frequent messages which present a load on servers (like SIP servers and STUN servers) and are bad for low speed access networks, such as cellular access. This document describes several mechanisms to discover NATs and firewalls and a method to query and control them. With these changes, binding discovery and keepalive traffic can be reduced to involve only the necessary NATs or firewalls. At the same time, backwards compatibility with NATs and firewalls that do not support this document is retrained. This document is discussed on the BEHAVE mailing list, &lt;https://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/behave>, in anticipation of a BoF at IETF69 in Chicago.</t></abstract>
