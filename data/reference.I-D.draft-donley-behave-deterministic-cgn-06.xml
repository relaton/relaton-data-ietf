<abstract><t>In some instances, Service Providers have a legal logging requirement to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the address used on the public Internet (e.g. for abuse response).  Unfortunately, many Carrier Grade NAT logging solutions require active logging of dynamic translations.  Carrier Grade NAT port assignments are often per-connection, but could optionally use port ranges.  Research indicates that per-connection logging is not scalable in many residential broadband services.  This document suggests a way to manage Carrier Grade NAT translations in such a way as to significantly reduce the amount of logging required while providing traceability for abuse response.  While the authors acknowledge that IPv6 is a preferred solution, Carrier Grade NAT is a reality in many networks, and is needed in situations where either customer equipment or Internet content only supports IPv4; this approach should in no way slow the deployment of IPv6.</t></abstract>
