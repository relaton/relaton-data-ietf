<abstract><t>This document diagrams the packet flows - both signaling and data - of Internet Emergency Preparedness (IEPREP) related protocols. This document serves as a point of reference for the WG when discussing which QoS mechanisms can be employed for each individual (application) protocol packet flow to function properly during congestion events from IP source to IP destination, as well as a potentially different QOS mechanism for a related but separate data flow (if present).</t></abstract>
