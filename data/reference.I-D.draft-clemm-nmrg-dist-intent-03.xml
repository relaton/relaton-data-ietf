<abstract><t>Intent and Intent-Based Networking are taking the industry by storm. At the same time, those terms are used loosely and often inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and confused with other concepts such as "policy".  This document is intended to clarify the concept of "Intent" and provide an overview of functionality that associated with it.  The goal is to contribute towards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality which can be used as foundation to guide further definition of associated research and engineering problems and their solutions.</t></abstract>
