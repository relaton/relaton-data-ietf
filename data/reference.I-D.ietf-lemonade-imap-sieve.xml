<abstract><t>Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in principle, plug into any point in the processing of an email message.  As defined in the base specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This document defines how Sieve can plug into points in the IMAP protocol where messages are created or changed, adding the option of user- defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions, features such as notifications).Note  This document defines extensions to IMAP and Sieve.  For now, it is the work of the Lemonade Working Group (Enhancements to Internet email to support diverse service environments), but it will be moved to the Sieve working group at some point.  1.  Discussion of this document should be taken to the Sieve mailing  list at mailto:ietf-mta-filters@imc.org  2.  Subscription requests can be sent to  mailto:ietf-mta-filters-request@imc.org?body=subscribe (send an  email message with the word "subscribe" in the body).  3.  A WWW archive of back messages is available at  http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sieve/index.html  4.  Older messages, which were posted to the lemonade mailing list,  are archived at  http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/lemonade/index.html</t></abstract>
