<abstract><t>This document analyzes the problems and limitation of the current flat-structured Host Identity Tag architecture. The document specifies a hierarchical HIT architecture which is compatible with the flat-structured HIT architecture. This architecture and the process of HIT generation ensure the global uniqueness of HITs. This architecture also enables the multiple Host Identity Protocol management domains, solves the deployment problem of current flat- structured HIT architecture. It also enhances the scalability and resolution efficiency of the mapping system from HIT to IP or FQDN.</t></abstract>
