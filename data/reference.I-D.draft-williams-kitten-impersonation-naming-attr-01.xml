<abstract><t>This document describes a method for impersonation of one principal by another.  Relying parties are expected to apply policy to decide which impersonation attempts they accept.  Trusted third parties may provide assistance in evaluating policy.  The proposed system fails safe: applications that do not support it see their peers as the impersonators, not the impersonated principals.</t></abstract>
