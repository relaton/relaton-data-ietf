<abstract><t>There are discussions on how loss-based congestion controls consider lost packets that have been recovered by a coding mechanism.  This document analyses to what extent transport protocols could ignore such signals and proposes best current practices on the interaction between congestion control and coding mechanism at the transport layer.  Coding for tunnels is out-of-the scope of the document. Examples of interest for the proposed solution is to better deal with tail losses or with networks with non-congestion losses.</t></abstract>
