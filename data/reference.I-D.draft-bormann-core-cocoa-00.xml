<abstract><t>The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that it does not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses.  The CoRE CoAP specification defines basic behavior that exhibits low risk of congestion with minimal implementation requirements.  It also leaves room for combining the base specification with advanced congestion control mechanisms with higher performance.  This specification defines some simple advanced CoRE Congestion Control mechanisms, Simple CoCoA.  In the present version -00, it is mainly a straw-man document to gauge the implementation effort required, with a view towards simplifying it further.</t></abstract>
