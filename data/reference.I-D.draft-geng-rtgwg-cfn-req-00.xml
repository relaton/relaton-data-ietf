<abstract><t>Service providers are exploring the edge computing to achieve better response times and transfer rate by moving the computing towards the edge of the network in scenarios like 5G MEC, virtualized central office, etc. Providing services by sharing computing resources from multiple edges is emerging. The service nodes from multiple edges normally have two key features, service equivalency and service dynamics. When the computing resources attached to a single edge site is overloaded, static service dispatch can possibly keep allocating the service request to it and cause inefficient utilization. The service request to edge computing needs to be dispatched to and served by the most suitable edge to improve user experience and system utilization by taking both the available computing resources and network conditions into account.  This draft describes scenarios and requirements of Compute First Networking (CFN) to make the computing and network resource to be considered in a collaborative way to achieve a more balanced network- based distributed service dispatching.</t></abstract>
