<abstract><t>In ICN (Information-centric network), everything is an identifiable object with a name, therefore the number of name prefixes is a few orders of magnitude higher than that in current BGP routing table. Towards scalable routing in ICN, we propose a name scheme, called container assisted  naming. With this scheme, an object name consists of two components: a content name which uniquely specifies the object within certain scope, and one or more containers which define access relationships to the object. This document illustrates the concept of container and how it assists scalable routing in ICN.</t></abstract>
