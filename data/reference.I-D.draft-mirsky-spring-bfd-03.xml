<abstract><t>Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source routing.  It can be realized in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network without any change to the data plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS label and an ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels.  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is expected to monitor any kind of paths between systems.  This document defines how to use Label Switched Path Ping to bootstrap and control path in reverse direction of a BFD session on the Segment Routing static MPLS tunnel.</t></abstract>
