<abstract><t>The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be performed by various persons or entities.  The RFC Editor model presented in this document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into four functions: The RFC Editor, the Independent Submission Editor, the RFC Production, and the RFC Publisher.  The model intends to increase flexibility and operational support options, provide for the orderly succession of the RFC Editor, and ensure the continuity of the RFC series, while maintaining RFC quality, maintaining timely processing, ensuring document accessibility, reducing costs, and increasing cost transparency.</t></abstract>
