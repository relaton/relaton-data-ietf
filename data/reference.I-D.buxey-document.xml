<abstract><t>RFC 822 [RFC0822] defines many headers which can be applied to email messages and RFC 2076 [RFC2076] provides a simple summary of the commonly occurring headers in headings of e-mail messages. Both of these RFCs define the 'In-Reply-To' and 'References' fields - which have since had their definitions improved in RFC 2822 [RFC2822] and RFC 1036 [RFC1036] respectively. These fields are used by 'thread capable' email clients to display messages grouped together in organised parent/child relationships that enable the reader to follow a train of thought or a process of information dissemination. However, if a reply to such a threaded message does not contain relevant follow-up information or is used as a platform to deliver a new message with new subject, then that reply is put within the already existing thread. This is known as 'Thread-Jacking'. This draft proposes a couple of techniques which can be undertaken to resolve this issue within the scope of email.</t></abstract>
