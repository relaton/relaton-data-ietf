<abstract><t>LEDBAT is an alternative experimental congestion control algorithm.  LEDBAT enables an advanced networking application to minimize the extra delay it induces in the bottleneck while saturating the bottleneck.  It thus implements an end-to-end version of scavenger service.  LEDBAT has been been implemented in BitTorrent DNA, as the exclusive congestion control mechanism, and in uTorrent, as an experimental mechanism, and deployed in the wild with favorable results.</t></abstract>
