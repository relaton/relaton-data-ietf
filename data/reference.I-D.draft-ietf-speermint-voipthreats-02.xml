<abstract><t>This memo presents the different security threats related to SPEERMINT, classifying them into threats to the Lookup Function (LUF), Location Routing Function (LRF), to the Signaling Function (SF) and to the Media Function (MF).  The different instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the classification.  Finally, the existing security solutions for SIP and RTP/RTCP are presented to describe the countermeasures currently available for such threats. Security requirements for SPEERMINT can be found in draft-ietf-speermint-requirements.  The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate SPEERMINT-specific threat vectors and to give guidance for implementers on selecting appropriate countermeasures.</t></abstract>
