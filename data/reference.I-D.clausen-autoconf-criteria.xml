<abstract><t>This document gives a general set of objective criteria to evaluate an autoconfiguration mechanism in a MANET environment. All criteria are important to outline an evaluation of an autoconfiguration mechanism. These criteria have been grouped into three classes: functional criteria, performance criteria and usability criteria. For each of the criteria, a description is outlined, hints are given on how to perform an adequate measure of the criterium, and an evaluation features the importance of the criterium in the full evaluation of a mechanism.</t></abstract>
