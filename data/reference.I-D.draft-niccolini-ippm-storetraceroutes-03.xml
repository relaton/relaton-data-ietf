<abstract><t>This memo describes a standard way to store traceroute measurements and related metrics. To better address the traceroute measurements storing issue, the authors first of all give a definition of the traceroute tool, describe the tool itself as well as its parameters and the default values on the most common operating systems and the output results that can be stored. Afterwards, the common information model with the base elements of the traceroute measurement storing is defined dividing the information elements in two semantically separated groups (configuration elements and results ones). Moreover an additional element is defined to relate configuration elements and results ones by means of a common unique identifier. On the basis of the information model a data model is then proposed in order to actually store the traceroute measurements. Finally considerations on how to extract relevant metrics related to traceroute measurements are given.</t></abstract>
