<abstract><t>When a server's IPv4 path and protocol is working but the server's IPv6 path and protocol are not working, a dual-stack client application experiences significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only client.  This is undesirable because it causes the dual- stack client to have a worse user experience.  This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay, and provides an example algorithm.</t></abstract>
