<abstract><t>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a network in order to provide traffic engineering calculations for its associated Path Computation Clients (PCCs).  This document describes general considerations for a stateful PCE deployment and examines its applicability and benefits through a number of use cases.  Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate documents.</t></abstract>
