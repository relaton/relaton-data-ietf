<abstract><t>The specification for a EAP based keying methodology for Proxy Mobile IP security is a topic of interest within some standard bodies such as WiMAX and is still under consideration. In this document, the authors intend to provide an first pass illustration on how the EAP keying framework may be used for bootstrapping keys between two agents performing a network service such as Proxy Mobile IP function. Care is taken so that the solution is aligned as closely as possible to the guidelines provided by the EAP Keying framework [EAPKEY]. The solution is, however, fitted to the constraints of the existing SDO scenarios and may not fully fit a future generic application keying solutions defined by HOAKEY.</t></abstract>
