<abstract><t>The Network Time Protocol can operate in several modes.  Some of these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets, and therefore require the use of a well-known port as the local port number.  However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a well- known port is not required, employing such well-known port unnecessarily increases the ability of attackers to perform blind/ off-path attacks.  This document formally updates RFC5905, recommending the use of transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization for those modes where use of the NTP well-known port is not required.</t></abstract>
