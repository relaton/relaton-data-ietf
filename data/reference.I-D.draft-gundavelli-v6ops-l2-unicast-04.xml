<abstract><t>When transmitting an IPv6 packet to a multicast group, the destination address in the link-layer header is typically set to the corresponding mapped address of the destination address from the IP header.  However, it is not mandatory that the destination address in the link-layer header is always a mapped multicast equivalent of its IP destination address.  There are various deployment scenarios where there is an opportunity for the sender to transmit the message as an unicast message on the link-layer.  Unfortunately, the IPv6 specifications do not clearly state this.  This document explicitly clarifies this point and makes such packet construct and transmission legal and valid.</t></abstract>
