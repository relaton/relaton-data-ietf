<abstract><t>This document proposes a marking scheme for tagging low-latency flows (for example: interactive voice and video, gaming, machine to machine applications) that is safe to use by the mobile network for matching such flows to suitable per-hop behaviors (EPS bearers defined by 3GPP) in its core and radio segments.  The suggested scheme re-uses NQB, a DiffServ-based signalling scheme with compatible rate-delay trade-off semantics that has been recently introduced in the context of fixed access to allow differential treatment of non-queue building vs queue building flows.</t></abstract>
