<abstract><t>This document proposes a mechanism for further experimentation, but not for widespread deployment at this time in the global Internet. TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a best-effort Internet environment [RFC 3448]. TFRC was intended for applications that use a fixed packet size, and was designed to be reasonably fair when competing for bandwidth with TCP connections using the same packet size. This document proposes TFRC-SP, a Small-Packet (SP) variant of TFRC, that is designed for applications that send small packets. The design goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve the same bandwidth in bps as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes. TFRC-SP enforces a Min Interval of 10 ms between data packets, to prevent a single flow from sending small packets arbitrarily frequently.</t></abstract>
