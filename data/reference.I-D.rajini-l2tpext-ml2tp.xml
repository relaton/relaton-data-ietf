<abstract><t>This memo talks about the problem that exist in the current L2TP network and the solution to that problem. In L2TP, internet link at LNS gets congested when two or more remote user starts communicating between them. This memo suggest multipoint capabality for L2TP, where LACs communicates between them and need not require LNS for every data packet. This draft also deals with the applications of multipoint L2TP in broadband networks.</t></abstract>
