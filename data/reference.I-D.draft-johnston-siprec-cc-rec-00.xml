<abstract><t>This document defines SIP extensions for session recording to meet the requirements in the "Requirements for SIP-based Media Recording (SIPREC)" document.  In particular, mechanisms to allow SIP elements to distinguish between the Recording Session and the Communication Session.  Also a mechanism for a UA to learn that the communication session is being recorded is proposed.  The Metadata about the session is not covered by this document.  SIP feature tags 'srs', 'src', and 'recorded' are defined to identify the Session Recording Server, Session Recording Client, and the presence of recording in the communication session.</t></abstract>
