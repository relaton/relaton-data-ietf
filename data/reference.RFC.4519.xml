<abstract><t>This document is an integral part of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) technical specification.  It provides a technical specification of attribute types and object classes intended for use by LDAP directory clients for many directory services, such as White Pages.  These objects are widely used as a basis for the schema in many LDAP directories.  This document does not cover attributes used for the administration of directory servers, nor does it include directory objects defined for specific uses in other documents.
