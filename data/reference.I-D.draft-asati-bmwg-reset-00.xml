<abstract><t>A forwarding device may get reset (automatically or manualy) and subsequently may experience an outage. It is deemed useful to know how long a device would take to recover after such an event.  &lt;&lt;delete>> The forwarding devices in the network may go out of service due to (hardware or software) reset event. It is deemed useful to know how long a device would take to recover after such an event. &lt;&lt;/delete>>  Moreover, there are varieties of reset triggers each deserving special attention. Hence, clarity and consistency in reset procedures (above &amp; beyond what's specified in RFC2544) are crucial to derive the meaningful results.  This document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset during benchmarking of forwarding devices, and provides clarity and consistency in reset procedures beyond what's specified in RFC2544.</t></abstract>
