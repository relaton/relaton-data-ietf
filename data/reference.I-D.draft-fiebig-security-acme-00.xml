<abstract><t>Most Public Key Infrastructure X.509 (PKIX) certificates are issued via the ACME protocol.  Recently, several attacks against domain validation (DV) have been published, including IP-use-after-free and (forced) on-path attacks.  These attacks can often be mitigated by (selectively) requiring additional challenges, such as DNS validation, proof of ownership of a prior certificate, and by being more diligent in operating a certificate authority.  This document provides a list of currently known attacks and describes mitigations and operational procedures to prevent issuing a certificate to an unauthorized party.</t></abstract>
