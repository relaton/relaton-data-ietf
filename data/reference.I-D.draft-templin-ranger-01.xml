<abstract><t>Enterprise networks will require support for both Internet protocol versions (IPv4 and IPv6) for an indeterminant period; perhaps even indefinitely.  This is particularly true for existing enterprise networks that must introduce IPv6 without disruption of IPv4 services, but the same principles apply also to clean-slate deployments in new enterprises.  Next-generation enterprises therefore require an architected solution for coordination of their internal routing and addressing plans for both IPv6 and IPv4.  The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements.</t></abstract>
