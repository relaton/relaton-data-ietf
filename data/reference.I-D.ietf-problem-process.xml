<abstract><t>This document suggests processes to address some of the problems identified in the IETF Problem Statement. This document decomposes each of the problems described in the problem statement into a few areas for improvement, categorizes them either as problems affecting the routine processes used to create standards or problems affecting the fundamental structure and practices of the IETF, and suggests ways to address the problems with the routine processes that can be implemented as soon as possible without disrupting other areas of the IETF processes.</t></abstract>
