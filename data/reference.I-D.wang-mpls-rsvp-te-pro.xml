<abstract><t>ASON (Automatic Switch Optical Network), which provides fast and dynamic connection from point to point, is the typical representation of the next generation intelligent optical network. There are two main kinds of resource reservation protocols in RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering), the most widely applied signaling in ASON, which are FRP (forward reservation protocol) and BRP (backward reservation protocol). Both of them are used to apply in single-domain optical network. However, when they are used in multi-domain optical network, there are apparent drawbacks. On base of FRP and BRP, we propose a reservation protocol-IDRPBP, which is based on priority in multi-domain optical network with wavelength conversion implement at border nodes. Through analysis and simulation, we find it can achieve the trade-off between blocking probability and connection setup time.</t></abstract>
