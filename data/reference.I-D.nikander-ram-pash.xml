<abstract><t>This document describes an incremental, network-based method for deploying SHIM6 or HIP based identifier / locator separation, called Proxying Approach to SHIM6 and HIP (PASH). This mechanism requires no changes to host stacks and, when deployed with routable Endpoint IDentifiers (EID), no changes to existing database infrastructures. The proposed protocol can be implemented in a relatively small number of routers, and deployed independently by ISPs. At the same time, it allows the network to gradually evolve towards full, host-based SHIM6 and/or HIP support, thereby making possible the larger architectural benefits that the network-based "jack-up" approaches provide. This proposal has been on the mental roadmaps within the HIP community for a number of years, but is properly documented only now as a result of the problem statement effort at the Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop (RAWS).</t></abstract>
