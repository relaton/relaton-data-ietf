<abstract><t>Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory has a defined syntax (i.e., data type).  A syntax definition specifies how attribute values conforming to the syntax are normally represented when transferred in LDAP operations.  This representation is referred to as the LDAP-specific encoding to distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.  This document introduces a new category of attribute options, called transfer encoding options, that can be used to specify that the associated attribute values are encoded according to one of these other methods.</t></abstract>
