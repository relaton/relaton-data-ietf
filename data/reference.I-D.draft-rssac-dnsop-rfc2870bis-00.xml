<abstract><t>This memo replaces RFC 2870.  As the Internet has become critical to the world's social and economic infrastructure, attention has rightly focused on the correct, safe, reliable, and secure operation of the Internet infrastructure itself.  The root domain and its name servers are a crucial part of that technical infrastructure.  The primary focus of this document is to provide guidelines for secure, stable, and resilient name service for the root zone. Additionally it will look into some specifics for the operation of the name servers.  Other operators of critical name servers--such as those for generic top-level domains (gTLDs), country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) and other major zones--may also find it useful.</t></abstract>
