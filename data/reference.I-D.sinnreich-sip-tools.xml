<abstract><t>For Internet-centric usage, the number of SIP required standards for presence; IM and audio/video communications can be drastically smaller than what has been published, by using only the rendezvous and session initiation capabilities of SIP. The simplification is based on avoiding emulating telephony and its model of the intelligent network. 'Simple SIP' by contrast relies on powerful computing endpoints. Simple SIP desktop applications can be combined with rich Internet applications (RIA). Significant telephony features may also be implemented in the endpoints.  This approach for SIP reduces the number of SIP standards to comply with, currently from roughly 100 and still growing, to about 11.  References for NAT traversal and for security are also provided.</t></abstract>
