<abstract><t>QUIC connection IDs allow continuation of connections across address/ port 4-tuple changes, and can store routing information for stateless or low-state load balancers.  They also can prevent linkability of connections across deliberate address migration through the use of protected communications between client and server.  This creates issues for load-balancing intermediaries.  This specification standardizes methods for encoding routing information and proposes an optional protocol called QUIC-LB to exchange the parameters of that encoding.  This framework also enables offload of other QUIC functions to trusted intermediaries, given the explicit cooperation of the QUIC server.</t></abstract>
