<abstract><t>The DNS is a query / response protocol.  Failure to respond to queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term problems with protocol development.  This document identifies a number of common classes of queries that some servers fail to respond too.  This document also suggests procedures for TLD and other similar zone operators to apply to help reduce / eliminate the problem.</t></abstract>
