<abstract><t>This document describes a protocol that allows a router to learn the performance characteristics of the network to its neighbors when the shared media link between them may provide highly dynamic bandwidth characteristics.  This information comes from the radio modems which are providing periodic updates about the quality of the radio signal to the routers listening for these updates on the same physical network segment.  The functionality is similar to that described in "PPPoE Extensions for Credit Flow and Link Metrics" [RFC5578] but applied to a local area network topology rather than a set of point- to-point links.</t></abstract>
