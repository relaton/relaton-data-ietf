<abstract><t>IETF Source Address Validation Improvements (SAVI) working group is chartered for source address validation within the first hop from the end hosts, i.e. preventing a node from spoofing the IP source address of another node in the same IP link.  However, since SAVI requires the edge routers or switches to be upgraded, the deployment of SAVI will need a long time.  During this transition period, some techniques for source address validation beyond the first hop (SAVI-BF) may be needed to complement SAVI.  In the document, we analyze the problems of the current SAVI-BF technique, and discuss the directions we can explore to improve SAVI-BF.</t></abstract>
