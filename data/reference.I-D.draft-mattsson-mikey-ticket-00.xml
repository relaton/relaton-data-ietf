<abstract><t>The Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) specification describes a key management scheme for real-time applications.  In this document, we note that the currently defined MIKEY modes are insufficient to address deployment scenarios built around a centralized key management service.  Such deployments are gaining in interest. Therefore, a new MIKEY mode that works well in such scenarios is defined.  The new mode uses a trusted key management service and a ticket concept, similar to that in Kerberos.  The new mode also supports features required by many existing applications, e.g. so called forking where the exact identity of the other endpoint may not be known at the initiation of the communication session.</t></abstract>
