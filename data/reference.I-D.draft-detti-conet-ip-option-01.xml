<abstract><t>The Content Centric Networking paradigm, also known as Named Data Networking, shifts the focus of networking from providing connections between hosts to efficiently providing content to the users.  The work on CCN has traditionally been performed looking at "clean-slate" solutions which aims to replace IP with a new paradigm.  On the other hand, in this memo we propose an "integration" approach to Content Centric Networking, i.e. we extend the IP protocol using a new IP Option.  The new IP option is used by routers to support networking based on content rather than (or better in addition to) end-point addresses.</t></abstract>
