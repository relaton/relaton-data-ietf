<abstract><t>IETF CCAMP WG has defined a set of extensions to OSPFv2 to support ASON routing requirements.  These extensions have been given EXP status rather than Standards Track and according to guidelines for OSPFv2 have not been allocated standard codepoints by IANA.  This draft describes implementation and interoperability testing experiences with ASON routing extensions to OSPFv2 which provide equivalent routing functionality to the extensions defined in IETF CCAMP with some differences in formatting of the extensions.  This summary of implementation and testing is provided to help move ASON Routing extensions for OSPF to Standards Track.</t></abstract>
