<abstract><t>Every version of the FTP specification has added a few new commands, with the early ones summarized in RFC 959.  RFC 2389 established a mechanism for specifying and negotiating FTP extensions.  As the number of those extensions increases, it appears useful to establish an IANA registry to reduce the likelihood of conflict of names and the consequent ambiguity.  This specification establishes that registry.</t></abstract>
