<abstract><t>This document defines two URI schemes.  The first, 'duri' (standing for "dated URI"), allows indicating a URI as of a particular date (and time).  This allows explicit reference to the "time of retrieval", similar to the way in which bibliographic references containing URIs are used.  The second scheme, 'tdb' ( standing for "Thing Described By"), provides a way of using a way of minting URIs for anything that can be described, with the ability to fix the description to a given date or time.  The 'tdb' URI scheme may reduce the need to define define new URN namespaces merely for the purpose of creating stable identifiers for concepts or abstractions: it provides a ready means for identifying "non-information resources" by semantic indirection -- a way of creating a URI for anything.  Note  This document is not a product of any working group.  Many of the ideas here have been discussed since 2001.  This document has been discussed on the mailing list &lt;uri@w3.org>.  Previous versions have couched 'tdb' and 'tdb' as URN namespaces.</t></abstract>
