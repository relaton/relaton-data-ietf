<abstract><t>Nowadays, many IPv6 transition technologies have been proposed, such as Dual-Stack, 6rd and so on.  A CPE may support some of them instead of only one.  But the ISPs always support different kinds of transition technologies, such as Dual-Stack, DS-lite and so on.  So they must control all the CPEs to match the exact transition tech through some standard messages. When the ISP network uses NFV, the message communication will between the network gateway and the V-CPE to configure the IPv6 transition technology in CPE.</t></abstract>
