<abstract><t>This document describes a potential performance issue in DECADE to support real-time applications.  It shows the current content hashing based naming scheme might harm the performance when the content data is generated in real time and low propagation latency of the data is required.  This draft propose a new naming scheme and protocol, subscribe/unsubscribe, for real-time applications to address the problem caused by content hashing.  DECADE clients use subscribe/ unsubscribe to express their interests to receive data streaming. DECADE servers pro-actively push stream data to eligible clients, which saves the time consumed on exchanging the hashing of new generated data.</t></abstract>
