<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a network component, application, or node that is capable of performing path computations at the request of Path Computation Clients (PCCs). The PCE is applied in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) networks and in Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks to determine the routes of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) through the network. The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCECP) is specified for communications between PCCs and PCEs, and between cooperating PCEs. This document provides application-specific requirements for the PCECP in support of a large-scale concurrent path computation application.</t></abstract>
