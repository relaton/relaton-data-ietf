<title>ARPANET 1822L Host Access Protocol</title>
<author initials='A.G.' surname='Malis' fullname='A.G. Malis'><organization /></author>
<date year='1981' month='November' />
<abstract><t>This document proposed two major changes to the current ARPANET host access protocol.  The first change will allow hosts to use logical addressing (i.e., host addresses that are independent of their physical location on the ARPANET) to communicate with each other, and the second will allow a host to shorten the amount of time that it may be blocked by its IMP after it presents a message to the network (currently, the IMP can block further input from a host for up to 15 seconds).  See RFCs 852 and 851.</t></abstract>
