<abstract><t>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN).  This document supplements to the CDNI Metadata Footprint Types defined in RFC 8006.  The Footprint Types defined in this document can be used for Footprint objects as part of the Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) defined in RFC 8008.  The defined Footprint Types are derived from requirements raised by Open Caching but are also applicable to CDNI use cases in general.</t></abstract>
