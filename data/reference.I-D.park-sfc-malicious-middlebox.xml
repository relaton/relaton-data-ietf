<abstract><t>This document addresses problems caused by malicious middleboxes and proposes a scheme that can detect them in Service Function Chaining (SFC) by combining two mechanisms: direct and indirect.  The direct mechanism injects a tool into the middleboxes to observe and report the state of each middlebox.  In contrast, the indirect mechanism creates a probe service chain, which includes trustful middleboxes, to investigate the operation of other middleboxes in the network.</t></abstract>
