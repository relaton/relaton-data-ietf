<abstract><t>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service aims at providing applications with information about the network to optimize their traffic. Peer-to-peer (P2P) live streaming is one of such applications which can benefit from ALTO. We have recently designed a new scheme to minimize inter-domain traffic in P2P live streaming applications without impacting video quality. In this draft we briefly describe our solution, and we discuss the implications of the type of information provided by the ALTO service on overlay construction.</t></abstract>
