<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism for authenticating OSPF packets by making use of the HMAC algorithm in conjunction with the SHA family of cryptographic hash functions. Because of the way the hash functions are used in HMAC construction, the collision attacks currently known against SHA-1 do not apply. This will be done in addition to the already documented authentication schemes described in the base specification.</t></abstract>
