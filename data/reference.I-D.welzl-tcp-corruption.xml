<abstract><t>This memo specifies options that enable TCP to detect corruption in the presence of link layers which hand over known-corrupt data to upper layers. The receiver notifies the sender of an erroneous segment that would otherwise be lost and assumed to be a sign of congestion. The sender uses this ACK to drive its RTO calculation, retransmit the segment and react to congestion earlier if ECE=1. In addition, this feedback could be used to realize a more appropriate rate change in response to such lost segments.</t></abstract>
