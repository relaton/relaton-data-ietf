<abstract><t>This document specifies a symmetric key format for transport and provisioning of symmetric keys (One Time Password (OTP) shared secrets or symmetric cryptographic keys) to different types of strong authentication devices.  The standard token format enables enterprises to deploy best-of-breed solutions combining components from different vendors into the same infrastructure.  This work is a joint effort by the members of OATH (Initiative for Open AuTHentication) to specify a format that can be freely distributed to the technical community.  The authors believe that a common and shared specification will facilitate adoption of two- factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability between commercial and open-source implementations.</t></abstract>
