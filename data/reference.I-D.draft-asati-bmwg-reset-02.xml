<abstract><t>An operational forwarding device may need to be re-configured or re- started for a variety of reasons, an event that we call a "reset" in this document. Since there may be an interruption in the forwarding operation during a reset, it is useful to know how long a device takes to begin forwarding packets again.  This document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset during benchmarking of forwarding devices, and provides clarity and consistency in reset test procedures beyond what's specified in RFC2544. It therefore updates RFC2544.</t></abstract>
