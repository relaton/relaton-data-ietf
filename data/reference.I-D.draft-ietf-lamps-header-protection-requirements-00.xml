<abstract><t>Privacy and security issues with email header protection in S/MIME have been identified for some time.  However, the desire to fix these issue has been expressed in the IETF LAMPS Working Group only recently.  The existing S/MIME specification is likely to be updated regarding header protection.  Several LAMPS WG participants expressed the opinion that whatever mechanism will be chosen, it should not be limited to S/MIME, but also applicable to PGP/MIME.  This document describes the problem statement, generic use cases, and requirements.  Additionally it drafts possible solutions to address the challenge.  Finally some best practices are collected.</t></abstract>
