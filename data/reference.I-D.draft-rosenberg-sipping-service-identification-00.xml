<abstract><t>This document considers the problem of how SIP endpoints can support a multiplicity of distinct SIP services within the context of a single user agent. The principle problem to be addressed is that of dispatching of incoming requests to the right services, and how service contexts are matched up between calling and called parties. This document proposes the usage of service URN and service URI to solve the problem.</t></abstract>
