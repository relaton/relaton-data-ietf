<abstract><t>The most common existing authentication mechanisms for HTTP are sent with each HTTP request, and authenticate that request instead of the underlying HTTP connection, or transport.  While these mechanisms work well for existing uses of HTTP, they are not suitable for emerging applications that multiplex non-HTTP traffic inside an HTTP connection.  This document describes the HTTP Transport Authentication Framework, a method of authenticating not only an HTTP request, but also its underlying transport.</t></abstract>
