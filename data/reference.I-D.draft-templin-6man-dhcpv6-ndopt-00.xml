<abstract><t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6ND) specifies a control message set for nodes to discover neighbors, routers, prefixes and other services on the link.  It also supports a manner of StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC).  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) specifies a service for the stateful delegation of addresses and prefixes.  Currently, at least two round-trip message exchanges are necessary in order to perform the IPv6ND router discovery and DHCPv6 address/ prefix delegation functions.  This document presents a protocol for combining these two round trips into a single round trip by joining the two services into a single unified service.</t></abstract>
