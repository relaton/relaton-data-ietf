<abstract><t>This document discusses how to use of SCTP for IP handover support. With the help of the dynamic address reconfiguration, the SCTP with the ADDIP extension (called mSCTP) would provide soft handover for the mobile terminals without any additional support of routers/agents in the networks. For location management, the mSCTP could be used along with Mobile IP, Session Initiation Protocol or Reliable Server Pooling. We also discuss the use of mSCTP along with Mobile IP for Internet mobility support.</t></abstract>
