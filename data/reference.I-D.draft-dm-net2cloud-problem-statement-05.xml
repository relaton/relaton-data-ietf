<abstract><t>This document describes the problems of enterprises face today in connecting their branch offices to dynamic workloads in third party data centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs).  It examines the approach of using SD-WAN to utilize multiple underlay networks by different providers to maximize or optimize interconnection among branch offices, on-premises DCs and Hybrid Cloud DCs.  This document also describes some of the (network) problems that many enterprises face when they have workloads &amp; applications &amp; data split among hybrid data centers, especially for those enterprises with multiple sites that are already interconnected by VPNs (e.g. MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN) and leased lines.  Current operational problems in the field are examined to determine whether there is a need for enhancements to existing protocols or whether a new protocol is necessary to solve them.</t></abstract>
