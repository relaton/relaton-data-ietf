<abstract><t>This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  In cases where applications/services (for example verification / billing) are provided by a network that is not the originating network the Network Asserted Identity is needed to provide these services.  This extension provides the ability for a 'diversion service' to provide a Network Asserted Identity of the last diverting user to these applications/services.  This extension defines a new general header, Last Diverting Line Identity which conveys the Network Asserted Identity of the diverting party to these applications/services.</t></abstract>
