<abstract><t>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public policy.  To conduct such measurements, user networks gather data, either on their own initiative or instructed by a measurement controller, and then upload the measurement results to a designated measurement server.  This document describes a logical architecture and summarizes key requirements for protocols to connect the components.  The system is designed to support residential and small- enterprise networks, using either wired or wireless networks.  The architecture supports an extensible set of active and passive measurements, but the details of the metrics themselves are beyond the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
