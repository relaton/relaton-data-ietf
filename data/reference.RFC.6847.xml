<abstract><t>Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) are two emerging standards in the data center environment.  While these two protocols are seemingly unrelated, they  have a very similar behavior in the forwarding plane, as both perform hop-by-hop forwarding over Ethernet, modifying the packet's Media Access Control (MAC) addresses at each hop.  This document describes an architecture for the integrated deployment of these two protocols.   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is  published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
