<abstract><t>The centralized traffic engineering technology adopts centralized calculation, PCE/SDN performs centralized calculation based on the collected link-status and TE information collected by BGP-LS/IGP, so that the traffic in the network is optimized to the optimization goal.  The distributed traffic engineering technology uses IGP to calculate the shortest path.  Each node in the network calculates the next hop to a destination address based on the same algorithm and network topology.  Each algorithm can calculate a shortest path tree in the entire network, which can reduce the amount of calculation, so that the hard convergence time of TE can be close to the convergence time of IGP.  The distributed computing and management methods can not co-ordinate management of network bandwidth resources.  As a result, network bandwidth resources can not be planned in an integrated manner, bandwidth resources are wasted, and even tunnels cannot be established.  This document attempts to discuss a automatic network optimization function of the distributed traffic engineering technology by the method of dynamically adjusting the link Metric.</t></abstract>
