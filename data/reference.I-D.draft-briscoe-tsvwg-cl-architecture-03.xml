<abstract><t>This document describes a deployment model for pre-congestion notification (PCN). PCN-based flow admission control and if necessary flow pre-emption preserve the Controlled Load service to admitted flows. Routers in a large DiffServ-based region of the Internet use new pre-congestion notification marking to give early warning of their own congestion. Gateways around the edges of the region convert measurements of this packet granularity marking into admission control and pre-emption functions at flow granularity. Note that interior routers of the DiffServ-based region do not require flow state or signalling - they only have to do the bulk packet marking of PCN. Hence an end-to-end Controlled Load service can be achieved without any scalability impact on interior routers.</t></abstract>
