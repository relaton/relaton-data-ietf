<abstract><t>After analysis and comparison of domestic and international wireless network secure schemes and standards, security threats for heterogeneous wireless network are investigated in theory and practice. According to the comprehensive summing-up of current secure standards' application, existing secure vulnerabilities and secure hidden troubles which may happen in future, "network layered,security classified and trusted domain departed" secure standard model is proposed, and corresponding standards for heterogeneous wireless network security architecture are also put forward.</t></abstract>
