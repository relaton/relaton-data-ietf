<abstract><t>Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched Paths (LSPs) use common piece(s) of resource along their paths. This can help save network resource and is useful in scenarios such as LSP recovery or when two LSPs do not need to be active at the same time. A Path Computation Element (PCE) is responsible for path computation with such requirement. The resource-sharing-based path computation with better efficiency can be achieved together with the association object in PCEP.  This document extends the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order to support resource sharing-based path computation, which is a special case in the association path computation.</t></abstract>
