<abstract><t>Over the history of IPv6, various classful address models have been proposed, none of which has withstood the test of time.  The last remnant of IPv6 classful addressing is a rigid network interface identifier boundary at /64.  This document removes the fixed position of that boundary for interface addressing.</t></abstract>
