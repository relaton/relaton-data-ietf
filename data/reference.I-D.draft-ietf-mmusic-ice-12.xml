<abstract><t>This document describes a protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal for multimedia session signaling protocols based on the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This protocol is called Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE). ICE makes use of the Simple Traversal Underneath NAT (STUN) protocol, applying its binding discovery and relay usages, in addition to defining a new usage for checking connectivity between peers.</t></abstract>
