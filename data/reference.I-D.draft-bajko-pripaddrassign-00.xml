<abstract><t>When IPv6 was designed, the assumption was that the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 will occur way before the exhaustion of the available    IPv4 address pool. The unexpected growth of the IPv4 Internet and the hesitation and technical difficulties to deploy IPv6 indicates that the transition may take much longer than originally anticipated. It is expected that communication using IPv6 addresses will increase during the next few years to come at the expense of communication using IPv4 addresses. The Internet should reach a safety point in the future, where the number of IPv4 public addresses in use at a given time begins decreasing. It is very likely that the IPv4 public address pool currently available at IANA will be exhausted before the internet reaches this safety point. This creates a need to prolong the lifetime of the available IPv4 addresses.  This document defines methods to allocate the same IPv4 address to multiple hosts, with the aim to prolong the availability of public IPv4 addresses, possibly for as long as it takes for IPv6 to take over the demand for IPv4.</t></abstract>
