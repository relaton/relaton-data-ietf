<abstract><t>The increase in complexity of modern networks makes it challenging to deploy new services and to keep networks up to date whilst maintaining stability and availability for critical business services. This is a major challenge that network operators (service providers, SME, etc) face today. The operators aim of streamlining both operations and the deployment of new services, is being met by increasingly relying on (1) software abstractions to simplify the design and configuration of monitoring and control operations and (2) the use of programmatic control over the configuration and operation of such networks. In this context, providing network operators with a generic policy- based management model that can be used to express policies on top of arbitrary configuration data models is essential.  In particular, SUPA addresses the needs of operators and application developers to use a generic policy-based management model for defining and representing multiple types of policy rules.</t></abstract>
