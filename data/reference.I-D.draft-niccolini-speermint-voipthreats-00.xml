Finally the existing security solutions in SIP and RTP/RTCP are presented to describe the countermeasures currently available for such threats. The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate the VoIP threat vectors in order to specifiy security-related requirements specific to peering. Once the requirements are identified, methods and solutions how to achieve such requirements can be selected.</t></abstract>
