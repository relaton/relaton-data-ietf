<abstract><t>After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated by the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possible that the call-taker feels the need for further communication.  For example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call- taker having sufficient information about the current situation of a wounded person.  A call-taker may trigger a callback towards the emergency caller using the contact information provided with the initial emergency call.  This callback could, under certain circumstances, be treated like any other call and as a consequence it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an answering machine.  The IETF emergency services architecture offers capabilities to allow callbask to bypass authorization policies to reach the caller without unnecessary delays.  However, the mechanism specified prior to this document supports only limited scenarios.  This document discusses some shortcomings, presents additional scenarios where better-than- normal call treatment behavior would be desirable, and specifies a protocol solution.</t></abstract>
