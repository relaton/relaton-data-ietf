<abstract><t>The ability to compute an optimal path for setting up Traffic engineering Label Switched Paths spanning multiple autonomous systems managed by different operators has been a key requirement in MPLS and GMPLS networks. This document specifies a method of computing inter-AS paths consisting of a list of ASes to be traversed and a list of FA-LSPs to be traversed in each AS. The method described here uses BGP running in the PCEs of each AS to distribute the inter-AS connectivity information and the FA-LSPs in each AS to its neighbors to facilitate the construction of an inter- AS topology graph which can be used for computing inter-AS paths.</t></abstract>
