<abstract><t>This document contains a privacy protection scheme for the AKA agreement in the 3GPP standards.  Specifically, this document RECOMMENDS that each user owns a encryption key updated in real time, with which to encrypt the user identity.  Comparing with the asymmetric encryption and alias assignment, the symmetric encryption scheme proposed in this document not only reduce the computation burden, but also prevent the legal user from being located and tracked.</t></abstract>
