<abstract><t>The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) specification provides a flexible and versatile means to represent location information. There are, however, circumstances that arise when information needs to be constrained in how it is represented so that the number of options that need to be implemented in order to make use of it are reduced. There is growing interest in being able to use location information contained in a PIDF-LO for routing applications. To allow successfully interoperability between applications, location information needs to be normative and more tightly constrained than is currently specified in the PIDF-LO. This document makes recommendations on how to constrain, represent and interpret locations in a PIDF-LO. It further recommends a subset of GML that MUST be implemented by applications involved in location based routing.</t></abstract>
