<abstract><t>This memo specifies a profile called "RTP/AVPFCC" for the use of the real-time transport protocol (RTP) and its associated control protocol, RTCP, with TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC). This profile extends the RTP/AVPF profile with RTP data header additions and new AVPF feedback packets, in order to support TFRCs integration with RTP. TFRC is an equation based congestion control scheme for unicast flows operating in a best effort Internet environment. This profile provides RTP flows with the mechanism to use congestion control in best effort IP networks.</t></abstract>
