<abstract><t>The migration from Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) to Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is the process of evolving an MPLS-TE control plane to a GMPLS control plane. An appropriate migration strategy can be selected based on various factors including the service provider's network deployment plan, customer demand, and operational policy. This document presents several migration models and strategies for migrating from MPLS-TE to GMPLS and notes that in the course of migration MPLS-TE and GMPLS devices or networks may coexist which may require interworking between MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocols. The applicability? of the interworking that is required is discussed as it appears to influence the choice of a migration strategy.</t></abstract>
