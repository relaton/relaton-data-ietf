<abstract><t>The IPv6 neighbor discovery cache is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack that purposely exhausts the state used during the neighbor discovery process.  This attack can be very disruptive when the target is a router.  This memo proposes a stateless form of neighbor discovery to be used by routers to mitigate this attack.  It does not require any changes to hosts.</t></abstract>
