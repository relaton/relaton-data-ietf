<abstract><t>This document defines basic terminology for describing different types of behavior for NATs and firewalls. It also defines a set of requirements for NATs and firewalls that would allow many applications, such as multimedia communications or online gaming, to work consistently. Developing NATs and firewalls that meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that applications will function properly.</t></abstract>
