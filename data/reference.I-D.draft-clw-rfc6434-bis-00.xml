<abstract><t>This document defines requirements for IPv6 nodes.  It is expected that IPv6 will be deployed in a wide range of devices and situations. Specifying the requirements for IPv6 nodes allows IPv6 to function well and interoperate in a large number of situations and deployments.  This document obsoletes RFC 6434, and in turn RFC 4294.  NB.  This is a first -00 version of the update to RFC 6434.  We have not yet edited original text from RFC 6434 apart from the author and acknowledgement texts, which carry forward from the older versions.  We have indicated intended changes (additions, updates or deletion of text at a high level in the sections below with text delimited by **BIS ... ** comments, e.g.  **BIS Add discussion of the impact of RFC xxxx **  **BIS Update reference of RFC 3484 and note new address selection implications**  etc.  These will become edits in future versions once the substance of the changes is agreed.</t></abstract>
