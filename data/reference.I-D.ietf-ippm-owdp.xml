<abstract><t>With growing availability of good time sources to network nodes, it becomes increasingly possible to measure one-way IP performance metrics with high precision. To do so in an interoperable manner, a common protocol for such measurements is required. The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) can measure one-way delay, as well as other unidirectional characteristics, such as one-way loss.</t></abstract>
