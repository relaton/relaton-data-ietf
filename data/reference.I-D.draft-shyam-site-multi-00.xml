<abstract><t>This document provides a solution for Site Multihoming of stub networks in a real IP environment. Each user interface in a customer network will have as many global unicast addresses as many service providers as it is connected with. Users can establish multiple connections through different service providers simultaneously. A customer network can maintain private address space to communicate within its users and can share its load while maintaining VPN services. Customer networks can provide IP mobility services as well.</t></abstract>
