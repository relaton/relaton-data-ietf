<abstract><t>The ITU-T has defined an architecture and requirements for operating an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).</t><t>The Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocol suite is designed to provide a control plane for a range of network technologies including optical networks such as time division multiplexing (TDM) networks including SONET/SDH and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs), and lambda switching optical networks.</t><t>The requirements for GMPLS routing to satisfy the requirements of ASON routing, and an evaluation of existing GMPLS routing protocols are provided in other documents.  This document defines extensions to the OSPFv2 Link State Routing Protocol to meet the requirements for routing in an ASON.</t><t>Note that this work is scoped to the requirements and evaluation expressed in RFC 4258 and RFC 4652 and the ITU-T Recommendations current when those documents were written.  Future extensions of revisions of this work may be necessary if the ITU-T Recommendations are revised or if new requirements are introduced into a revision of RFC 4258.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the  Internet community.</t></abstract>
