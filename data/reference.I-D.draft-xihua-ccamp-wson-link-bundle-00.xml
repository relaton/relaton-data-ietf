<abstract><t>[RFC4201] provides a link bundle mechanism to improve routing scalability by reducing the amount of information that has to be handled by IGP (OSPF and/or IS-IS).  This reduction is accomplished by performing information aggregation/abstraction.  As with any other information aggregation/abstraction, this results in losing some of important information.  In WSON and MRN, this lost information is very important for the path computation entity to calculate an accurate path.  This document discusses some requirements of link bundle for the new GMPLS networks (e.g., WSON and MRN).  The draft gives some routing and signaling analysis for this issue.</t></abstract>
