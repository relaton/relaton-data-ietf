<abstract><t>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol is computationally intensive with respect to the number of round-trips required and cryptographic operations involved. In particular the Extensible Authentication Protocol is used for authentication, which adds additional computational intensity. To re-establish security associations (SA) upon a failure recovery condition is time comsuming, especially when an IPsec peer, such as a VPN gateway, needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with various end points. A high number of concurrent sessions might cause additional problems for an IPsec peer during SA restablishment. In many failure cases it would be useful to provide an efficient way to resume an interrupted IKE/IPsec session. This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously establied IKE SA. A client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected, or alternatively migrate to another gateway that is associated with the previous one. The proposed approach conveys IKEv2 state information, in the form of an encrypted ticket, to a VPN client that is later presented to the VPN gateway for re-authentication. An encrypted ticket cannot be decrypted by a VPN client but allows a VPN gateway to restore state for faster session state setup.</t></abstract>
