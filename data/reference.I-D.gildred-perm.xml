<abstract><t>This document describes the Protected Entertainment Rights Management (PERM) protocol for management of usage rights to digital entertainment content. PERM is not intended to replace existing copy protection and conditional access systems. Rather it is intended to complement such systems by providing standardized methods of device and user authentication, content protection and content rights management across heterogeneous data networks. PERM does not impose any content usage policy upon an implementation of the PERM protocol. PERM defines a common method for policy enforcement, and implementors are free to design and enforce their own policy by using the features and conventions of the PERM protocol.</t></abstract>
