<abstract><t>Network mobility arises when a router connecting a network to the Internet dynamically changes its point of attachment to the Internet thereby causing the reachability of the said network to be changed in relation to the fixed Internet topology.  Such a type of network is referred to as a mobile network.  With appropriate mechanisms, sessions established between nodes in the mobile network and the global Internet can be maintained after the mobile router changes its point of attachment.  This document outlines the goals expected from network mobility support and defines the requirements that must be met by the NEMO Basic Support solution.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
