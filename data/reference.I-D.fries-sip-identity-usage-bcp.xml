<abstract><t>This document describes a use case for RFC4474 (SIP Identity) for verifying a certificate that might not be publicly verifiable by traditional means. It provides a best current practice document for binding an identity to a certificate for the duration of a session. The certificate may then be used to bootstrap further security parameters, e.g., for securing media data. A discussion of possible enhancements is included in the appendix. Editors Note: The first version of this draft was discussed in the SIPPING WG. As the target of this draft is a BCP for current issues, the draft was updated and submitted to the SIP WG.</t></abstract>
