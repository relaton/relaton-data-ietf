<abstract><t>This specification describes the use of the SHA-256 algorithm in conjunction with HMAC as a data origin authentication and integrity verification mechanism for the IPsec AH, ESP, and IKEv2 protocols, and also as a PRF for IKEv2. Two output truncation lengths are specified for data origin authentication and integrity verification usage, with the corresponding algorithms designated as HMAC-SHA-256- 128 and HMAC-SHA-256-192. No truncation is specified for PRF usage, and the resulting algorithm is designated as HMAC-SHA-PRF-256.</t></abstract>
