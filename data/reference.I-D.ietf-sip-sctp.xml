<abstract><t>This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream Control Transmission Protocol) as the transport between SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) entities. SCTP is a new protocol which provides several features that may prove beneficial for transport between SIP entities which exchange a large amount of messages, including gateways and proxies. As SIP is transport independent, support of SCTP is a relatively straightforward process, nearly identical to support for TCP.</t></abstract>
