<abstract><t>This memo describes a mechanism to provide a secure binding between the multiple addresses with different prefixes available to a host within a multihomed site.  This mechanism employs either Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) or a new variant of the same theme that uses the same format in the addresses.  The main idea in the new variant is that information about the multiple prefixes is included within the addresses themselves.  This is achieved by generating the interface identifiers of the addresses of a host as hashes of the available prefixes and a random number.  Then, the multiple addresses are generated by prepending the different prefixes to the generated interface identifiers.  The result is a set of addresses, called Hash Based Addresses (HBAs), that are inherently bound to each other.</t></abstract>
