It is a summary of the &quot;oral tradition&quot; of the Internet on this subject.  [RFC Editor's note: This memo is a contribution by the author of his view of these conventions.  It is expected that this RFC will provide a basis for the development of official policies in the future.] These conventions may be supplemented or amended by the policies of specific local and regional components of the Internet.
