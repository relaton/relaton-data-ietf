<abstract><t>BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC8955, RFC8956) describes the distribution of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) which are distributed via BGP to BGP peers.  Multiple applications utilize the BGP distributed traffic filter policy.  These applications include: (1) mitigation of Denial of Service (DoS), (2) enabling of traffic filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNS, (3)centralized traffic control for networks utilizing either SDN control of router firewall functions.  During the deployment of BGP flow specification v1, the following issues were detected: 1) problems due to the lack of clear TLV encoding for rules for flow specifications, 2) desire to order filters rules, and 3) ordering of actions to provide deterministic actions.  Version 2 of the BGP flow specification protocol addresses these features.</t><t> BGP Flow Specification v2 is encapsulated in a different NLRI which encapsulates previous flow specification informatino.</t></abstract>
