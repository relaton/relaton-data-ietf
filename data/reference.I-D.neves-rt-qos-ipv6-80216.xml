<abstract><t>This document addresses the support of IPv6 QoS aware real-time services over IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] networks. In particular, it provides a novel solution to overcome the limitations of the IEEE 802.16-2004 [2] system to support real-time and dynamic environments. Specifically, this solution supports dynamic and fast access from the Mobile Nodes to the network services and dynamic reservations and modifications of services. These fast and dynamic reservations are crucial to the support of fast mobility approaches. Moreover, the proposed solution is also able to provide IPv6 support and efficient traffic differentiation for services running on the same MN.</t></abstract>
