<abstract><t>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource.  ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol.  Before an ALTO client can ask for guidance it needs to discover one or more ALTO servers that can provide suitable guidance.  This document specifies a procedure for third-party ALTO server discovery, which can be used if the ALTO client is not co-located with the actual resource consumer, but instead embedded in a third party such as a peer-to-peer tracker.</t></abstract>
