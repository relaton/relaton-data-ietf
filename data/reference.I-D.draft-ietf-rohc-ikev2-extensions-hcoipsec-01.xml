<abstract><t>When using Header Compression (HC) schemes (e.g. ROHC [ROHC]) in conjunction with IPsec [IPSEC] (i.e. [HCOIPSEC]) a mechanism is needed to negotiate ROHC configuration parameters between end-points prior to operation. Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is a mechanism which can be leveraged to handle these negotiations. This document specifies extensions to Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2 [IKEV2]) that will allow ROHC and its associated configuration parameters to be negotiated for IPsec security associations (SAs).</t></abstract>
