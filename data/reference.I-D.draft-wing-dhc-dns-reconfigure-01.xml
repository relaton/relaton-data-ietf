<abstract><t>Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and IPV6-only hosts at the same time.  This makes prioritizing the DNS servers for hosts tricky due to a heterogeneous mix of protocol stacks causing optimal behavior to occur only when the host stack re- initializes.  The networks infrastructure is usually well equipped to be aware of single/dual-stack nature of hosts.  This specification extends DHCPv6 so that a DHCPv6 Relay Agent can dynamically influence the priority of DNS servers provided to the host, so that the host can use an optimal DNS server for resolution.</t></abstract>
