<abstract><t>During discussions of a document to provide a standard representation and encoding of Domain-Sequence within the Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs, it was determined that there was a need for clarification with respect to the ordered nature of the Include Route Object (IRO).  An informal survey was conducted to determine the state of current and planned implementation with respect to IRO ordering and handling of Loose bit (L bit).  This document updates the IRO specification of RFC 5440 based on the survey conclusion and recommendation.</t></abstract>
