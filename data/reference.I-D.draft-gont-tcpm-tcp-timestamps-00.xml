<abstract><t>This document describes an algorithm for selecting the timestamps (TS value) used for TCP connections that use the TCP timestamp option, such that the resulting timestamps are monotonically-increasing across connections that involve the same four-tuple {local IP address, local TCP port, remote IP address, remote TCP port}.  The properties of the algorithm are such the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced.  Additionally, it describes an algorithm for processing incoming SYN segments to allow a higher connection establishment rates to any TCP end-point.</t></abstract>
