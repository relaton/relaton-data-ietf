<abstract><t>At the IETF, we currently use a set of methods to communicate a point of view, to solicit input, to resolve conflict and attempt to obtain consensus within the group.  These methods include: writing an Internet Draft, discussion on email lists, discussion at face-to- face, interim or virtual meetings, and design teams.  At times, these methods fall short.  People become entrenched in their positions.  A Working Group may be split 80-20 or 70-30 for a prolonged period. This wastes time and energy and may have a lasting impact.  This document discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each of the current methods of communication focusing solely on their efficacy at conflict resolution.   A companion document will propose some solutions including alternative methods of conflict resolution.</t></abstract>
