<abstract><t>This document provides a problem statement for the Trust Anchor Management Birds of a Feather (BOF). Trust anchors are trusted public keys, and associated information, that are used to verify digital signatures on a variety of objects including public key certificates, certificate management protocol exchanges and firmware packages. At present, there exists no standards-based protocol for distributing and managing trust anchors. This document describes some of the problems associated with the lack of a standards-based trust anchor management mechanism as well as problems that must be addressed by such a mechanism.</t></abstract>
