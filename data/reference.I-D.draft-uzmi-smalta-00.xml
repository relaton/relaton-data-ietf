<abstract><t>Concerns about the growth of the global routing table has led to proposals for short-term FIB-reduction and long-term RIB-reduction solutions.  The simplest type of FIB-reduction solution is "FIB aggregation", whereby individual routers locally reduce the FIB size without any changes to external operation.  The draft [I-D.zhang-fibaggregation] describes and analyzes several FIB aggregation schemes.  This current draft describes and analyzes another point in the design space, called SMALTA.  Compared to the approaches in [I-D.zhang-fibaggregation], SMALTA provides better aggregation and does not introduce non-routable entries in the FIB, but is also more complex.</t></abstract>
