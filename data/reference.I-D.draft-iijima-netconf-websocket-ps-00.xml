<abstract><t>This memo proposes transporting NETCONF Notification over WebSocket protocol[I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol].  RFC5277[RFC5277] specifies that NETCONF Notification must be sent over SSH, BEEP, SSL and console from an NETCONF server to NETCONF clients.  When NETCONF Notification was defined, this transport mapping was a reasonable decision.  Bi-directional capability is necessary for transporting NETCONF Notification.  But at present, WebSocket protocol, which is based on HTTP and has a bi-directional capability, is available. This memo describes the way in which NETCONF Notification is sent over WebSocket protocol.</t></abstract>
