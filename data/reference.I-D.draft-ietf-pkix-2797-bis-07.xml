<abstract><t>This document defines the base syntax for CMC, a Certificate Management protocol using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). This protocol addresses two immediate needs within the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) community:  1.  The need for an interface to public key certification products  and services based on CMS and PKCS #10 (Public Key Cryptography  Standard), and  2.  The need for a PKI enrollment protocol for encryption only keys  due to algorithm or hardware design.  CMC also requires the use of the transport document and the requirements usage document along with this document for a full definition.</t></abstract>
