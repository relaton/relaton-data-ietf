<abstract><t>This memorandum describes an engineering model which implements a precision time-of-day function for a generic operating system. The model is based on the principles of disciplined oscillators and phase-lock loops (PLL) often found in the engineering literature. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</t></abstract>
