<abstract><t>Detecting Network Attachment (DNA) requires the rapid detection of link identity and validation of the current IP configuration [3]. Even though acquiring the configuration for a new link is outside the scope of DNA, mechanisms that can accomplish both DNA and collect possible configuration information about the current link will prove to be very useful in rapidly changing network environments. RFC 2461 defines a Router Discovery (RD) procedure [1] to learn about the available access routers on an L3 link. RFC 2461 [1] also defines Neighbor Discovery (ND) procedure to discover neighbors in the same link. This draft recommends a few simple modifications to the Router Discovery (RD) procedure defined by RFC 2461 [1] that can lead to efficient Router Reachability Detection (RRD), while enabling the quick learning of other available routers if the current router is not available.</t></abstract>
