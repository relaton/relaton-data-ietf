<abstract><t>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IPv6-based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications.  First, this document explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  Next, it makes a problem statement about key aspects in IPv6-based vehicular networking, such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, and Security &amp; Privacy.  For each key aspect, this document specifies requirements for IPv6-based vehicular networking.</t></abstract>
