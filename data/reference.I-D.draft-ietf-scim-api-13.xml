Examples include but are not limited to enterprise to cloud service providers, and inter-cloud based scenarios.  The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models.  SCIM's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model and a service protocol defined by this document.</t></abstract>
