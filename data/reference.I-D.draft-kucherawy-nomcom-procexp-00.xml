<abstract><t>The criteria by which one qualifies to be a selecting member of the IETF Nominating Committee are somewhat limited, having been developed long before the current IETF meeting model that allows for greater remote participation both during and between organized meetings. This document describes a process experiment whereby those criteria are extended to meet the IETF's current participation model.  If successful, the results of this experiment can be folded into our permanent NomCom procedures.</t></abstract>
