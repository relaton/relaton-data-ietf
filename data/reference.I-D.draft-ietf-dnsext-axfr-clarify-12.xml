<abstract><t>The Domain Name System standard mechanisms for maintaining coherent servers for a zone consist of three elements.  One mechanism is the Authoritative Transfer (AXFR) defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035. The definition of AXFR has proven insufficient in detail, thereby forcing implementations intended to be compliant to make assumptions, impeding interoperability.  Yet today we have a satisfactory set of implementations that do interoperate.  This document is a new definition of AXFR -- new in the sense that is it recording an accurate definition of an interoperable AXFR mechanism.</t></abstract>
