<abstract><t>ALC and FLUTE are reliable content delivery protocols designed mainly for scalable multicast distribution. However, this does not preclude their deployment in the Unicast distribution mode over connectionless or connection-oriented transport protocols. A method for framing ALC and FLUTE packets onto connection-oriented transport is presented. A definition of the descriptors of the framing method for those protocols is also given.</t></abstract>
