<abstract><t>In a virtual RBridge(RBv), traffic from end station ES1 to ES2 will enter a TRILL campus through one member RBridge RB1 of RBv, but reverse traffic might choose another member RBridge RB2 to leave TRILL campus.  If RB1 can't obtain the location of ES2 via other means, it has to treat the traffic to ES2 as unknown destination traffic and multicasts it in TRILL campus.  However, if RB2 can share its learned MAC addresses with RB1, the above problem can be resolved.  Based on appropriate extensions of ESADI, this document proposes, in control plane, an approach for informations synchronization within a group of RBridges.  Current informations mainly include end station addresses, but may include other informations in the future.</t></abstract>
