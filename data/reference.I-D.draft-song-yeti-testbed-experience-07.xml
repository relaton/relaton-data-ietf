<abstract><t>The Internet's Domain Name System is designed and built on a single root, known as the Root Server System.  Yeti DNS is an experimental, non-production root server testbed that provides an environment where technical and operational experiments can safely be performed without risk to production root server infrastructure.This testbed has been used by a broad community of participants to perform experiments that aim to inform operations and future development of the production DNS.  Yeti DNS is an independently-coordinated project and is not affiliated with ICANN, IANA or any Root Server Operator.  The Yeti DNS testbed implementation includes various novel and experimental components including IPv6-only transport, independent, autonomous Zone Signing Key management, large cryptographic keys and a large number of Yeti-Root Servers names.  These differences from the Root Server System have operational consequences such as large responses to priming queries and the coordination of a large pool of independent operators; by deploying such a system globally but outside the production DNS system, the Yeti DNS project provides an opportunity to gain insight into those consequences without threatening the stability of the DNS.  This document neither addresses the relevant policies under which the Root Server System is operated nor makes any proposal for changing any aspect of its implementation or operation.  This document aims solely to document the technical and operational experience of deploying a system which is similar to but different from the Root Server System.</t></abstract>
