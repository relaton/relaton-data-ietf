<abstract><t>This document specifies a framework and a mapping function for 5G mobile user plane with transport network slicing, integrated with Mobile Radio Access and a Virtualized Core Network.  The integrated approach specified in a way to address all the mobility scenarios defined in [TS23.501] and to be backward compatible with LTE [TS.23.401-3GPP] network deployments.  It focuses on an optimized mobile user plane functionality with various transport services needed for some of the 5G traffic needing low and deterministic latency, real-time, mission-critical services. This document describes, how this objective is achieved agnostic to the transport underlay used (IPv4, IPv6, MPLS) in various deployments and with a new transport network underlay routing, called Preferred Path Routing (PPR).</t></abstract>
