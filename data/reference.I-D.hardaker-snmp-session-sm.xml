<abstract><t>This document describes a Session Based Security Model (SBSM) for use within version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3). The security model is designed to establish a "session" between two interacting SNMPv3 entities, over which SNMP operations can be sent securely. It provides a number of security properties not previously available in defined SNMPv3 security models, such as public key based identity authentication, limited life-time keying, and the ability to make use of previously implemented and deployed security infrastructures for purposes of identification and authentication.</t></abstract>
