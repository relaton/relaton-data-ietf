<abstract><t>This document describes a method for enabling and configuring network access for IoT devices that are first authenticated at a server. This server may be run by the manufacturer of the IoT device as an online cloud service.  This specification is intended for off-the- shelf IoT devices that have just been purchased by the user.  Many of these devices have only limited user interfaces that can be used for configuring network access credentials.  The device configuration is also made more challenging by the fact that these devices may exist in large numbers.</t></abstract>
