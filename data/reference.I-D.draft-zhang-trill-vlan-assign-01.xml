<abstract><t>If RBridges are casually assigned as Appointed Forwarders for VLANs without considering the number of MAC addresses and traffic load of these VLANs, it may overload some of the RBridges while leave other RBridges lightly loaded, which reduces the scalability of a RBridge network and undermines its performance.  There can only be a single appointed forwarder for one VLAN carried by a LAN link at the same time, even if this LAN link is attached to multiple points of an RBridge campus. This limitation not only wastes the available access bandwidth of RBridge campus but also reduces its reliability.  A new protocol is designed in this document to support the adaptive VLAN assignment (or Appointed Forwarder selection) based on the forwarders' reporting of their usage of MAC tables and available bandwidth. Link aggregation is proposed to overcome the single forwarder limitation of TRILL.</t></abstract>
