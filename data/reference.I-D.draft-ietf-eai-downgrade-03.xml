<abstract><t>Traditional mail systems handle only US-ASCII characters in SMTP envelope and mail header fields. The Email Address Internationalization is implemented by allowing UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail header fields (UTF8SMTP). To deliver Non- ASCII mail address via UTF8SMTP non-compliant environment, some sort of converting mechanism (i.e. downgrading) is required. This document describes requirements for downgrading, SMTP downgrading, Email header downgrading and implementation consideration.</t></abstract>
