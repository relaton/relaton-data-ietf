<abstract><t>The Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) described in this memo permits a Calendar User (CU) to utilize a Calendar User Agent (CUA) to access an iCAL-based Calendar Store (CS).  At the time of this writing, three vendors are implementing CAP, but it has already been determined that some changes are needed.  In order to get implementation experience, the participants felt that a CAP specification is needed to preserve many years of work.  Many properties in CAP which have had many years of debate, can be used by other iCalendar protocols.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
