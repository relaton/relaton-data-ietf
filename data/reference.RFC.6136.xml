<abstract><t>This document provides framework and requirements for Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM).  The OAM framework is intended to provide OAM layering across L2VPN services, pseudowires (PWs), and Packet Switched Network (PSN) tunnels.  This document is intended to identify OAM requirements for L2VPN services, i.e., Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), and IP-only LAN Service (IPLS). Furthermore, if L2VPN service OAM requirements impose specific requirements on PW OAM and/or PSN OAM, those specific PW and/or PSN OAM requirements are also identified.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
