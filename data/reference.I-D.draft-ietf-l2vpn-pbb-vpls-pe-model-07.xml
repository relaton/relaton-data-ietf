<abstract><t>IEEE 802.1 Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB) [IEEE.802.1Q-2011] defines an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB was defined in IEEE as a connectionless technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels.  PBB can be used to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses and number of service instances that can be supported.  Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4664] provides a framework for extending Ethernet LAN services, using MPLS tunneling capabilities, through a routed MPLS backbone without running RSTP or MSTP across the backbone. As a result, VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in service provider networks.  This draft discusses extensions to the VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model required to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining the Service Provider fit of the initial model.</t></abstract>
