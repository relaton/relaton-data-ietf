<abstract><t>This document describes methods for DNS resolvers to self-publish information about themselves.  The information is returned as a JSON object.  The names in this object are defined in an IANA registry that allows for light-weight registration.  Applications and operating systems can use the methods defined here to get the information from resolvers in order to make choices about how to send future queries to those resolvers.</t></abstract>
