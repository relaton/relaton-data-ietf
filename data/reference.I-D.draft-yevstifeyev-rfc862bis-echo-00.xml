<abstract><t>This document specifies Echo protocol, that was firstly defined in RFC 862. However that document does not match current Internet Standards and specifies Echo protocol for TCP and UDP only, while a number of other transport-layer protocols have appeared since the time of publication of RFC 862.  This document aligns Echo protocol specification with the current Internet Standards and specifies Echo protocol for the most wide- spread transport-layer protocols. It obsoletes RFC 347 and RFC 862 and moves the last to Historic status.</t></abstract>
