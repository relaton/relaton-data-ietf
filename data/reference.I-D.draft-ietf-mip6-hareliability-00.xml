<abstract><t>The home agent can be a single point of failure when Mobile IPv6 is used in a system. It is critical to provide home agent reliability in the event of a home agent crashing or becoming unavailable. This would allow another home agent to take over and continue providing service to the mobile nodes. This document describes the problem scope briefly and provides a mechanism for achieving home agent reliability. Note that this document is not completed yet. DT is still discussing some items.</t></abstract>
