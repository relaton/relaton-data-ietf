<abstract><t>Communicating various routing policies via route tagging plays an important role in external BGP peering relations.  It is also a very common best practice among operators to propagate various additional information about routes intra domain.  The most common tool used today to attach various information about routes is realized with the use of BGP communities.  Such information is important for the BGP speakers to perform some mutually agreed actions without the need to maintain a separate offline database for each pair of prefix and an associated with it requested set of action entries.  This document defines a new encoding which will enhance and simplify what can be accomplished today with the use of BGP communities.  The most important addition this specification brings over currently defined BGP communities is the ability to specify, carry as well as use for execution operator's defined set of parameters. Specification also provides an extensible platform for any new community encoding needs in the future.</t></abstract>
