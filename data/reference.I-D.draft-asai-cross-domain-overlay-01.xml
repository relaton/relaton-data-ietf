<abstract><t>This document provides an idea of cross-domain traffic control in overlay routing such as peer-to-peer content delivery networks to reduce transit traffic that costs more for Internet service providers.  The simulation results in this document show the advantage of AS relationships-aware overlay routing and cross-domain cooperation.  This document also proposes a solution approach to take into account AS relationships for overlay routing, with hiding confidential information as much as possible.</t></abstract>
