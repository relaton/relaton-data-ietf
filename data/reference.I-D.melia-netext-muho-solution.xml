<abstract><t>This document provides extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 in order to support multihomed mobile nodes (MN).  These extensions are intended to permit such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets on multiple interfaces in a simultaneous and possibly discriminated manner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain.  A typical usage of these extensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination through multiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MN interface to VOIP traffic and another MN interface to HTTP traffic).  The proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backward compatible manner the current PMIPv6 specification.  In addition these extensions use, when possible, existing specifications related to multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statement of Netext Working Group.</t></abstract>
