<abstract><t>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication.  The security needs for the IoT are well-recognized and many standardization steps for providing security have been taken, for example, the specification of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). However, security challenges still exist and there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution.  In this document, we first discuss the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing.  Next, we document the various security threats to a thing and the challenges that one might face to protect against these threats.  Lastly, we discuss the next steps needed to facilitate the deployment of secure IoT systems. This document can be used by IoT standards specifications as a reference for details about security considerations applying to the specified protocol.  This document is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG).</t></abstract>
