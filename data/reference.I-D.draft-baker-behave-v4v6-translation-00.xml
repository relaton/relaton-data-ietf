<abstract><t>This document specifies an update to the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT) described in RFC 2765.  The algorithm translates between IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers (including ICMP headers).  This specification addresses both a stateful and a stateless mode. In the stateful mode, translation state is maintained between IPv4 address/transport/port tuples and IPv6 address/transport/port tuples, enabling IPv6 systems to open sessions with IPv4 systems.  In the stateless mode, translation information is carried in the address itself, permitting both IPv4->IPv6 and IPv6->IPv4 session establishment with neither state nor configuration in the translator. The choice of operational mode is made by the operator deploying the network and is critical to the operation of the applications using it.  Significant issues exist in the stateful mode that are not addressed in this document, related to the maintenance of the translation tables.  This document confines itself to the actual translation.  Acknowledgement of previous work  This document is a product of the 2008-2009 effort to define a replacement for NAT-PT.  It is an update to and directly derivative from Erik Nordmark's [RFC2765], which similarly provides both stateless and stateful translation between IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC2460], and between ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443].  The original document was a product of the NGTRANS working group.  Some text had been extracted from an old Internet Draft titled "IPAE: The SIPP Interoperability and Transition Mechanism" authored by R. Gilligan, E. Nordmark, and B. Hinden.  The changes in this document reflect five components:  1.  Updating references  2.  Redescribing the network model to map to present and projected  usage  3.  Moving the address format to the framework document, to  coordinate with other drafts on the topic  4.  Some changes in ICMP.  5.  Description of both stateful and stateless operation.</t></abstract>
