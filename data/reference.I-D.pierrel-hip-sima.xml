<abstract><t>A Host Identity Protocol supporting host is able to use multiple interfaces simultaneously when it implements the Mobility and Multihoming HIP extensions. The protocol defines currently simultaneous usage via multiple interfaces only towards different peer hosts. Simultaneously using multiple interfaces towards one peer node was not defined due to e.g. potential problems with upper layer congestion control algorithms. The limitation of that protocol is that it allows only one interface to be used at a time between the multi-homed host and the peer host. There is no mechanism to separate the flows between two hosts and to allow them to use different interfaces independent from each other. This memo presents a method where two HIP hosts, of which at least one is multi-homed, can separate different upper layer data flows such as TCP and UDP between the hosts and allow them to use different interfaces at the multi-homed host.</t></abstract>
