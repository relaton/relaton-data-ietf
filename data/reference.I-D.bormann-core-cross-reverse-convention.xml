<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  In many applications, CoAP will be used via cross-protocol proxies from HTTP clients.  HTTP client libraries may make it hard to operate an HTTP-CoAP forward proxy by not providing a way to put a CoAP URI on the HTTP Request-Line; reverse-proxying may therefore lead to wider applicability of a proxy.  This specification will define a convention for URIs operating such a HTTP-CoAP reverse proxy.  The current version of this specification is a placeholder only.  It is meant to pick up http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/ticket/259 and provide a home for its considerations.  It might be merged with other documents later.</t></abstract>
