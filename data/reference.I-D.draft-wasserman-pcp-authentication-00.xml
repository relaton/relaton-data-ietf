<abstract><t>A IPv6 or IPv4 host can use the Port Control Protocol (PCP) to flexibly re-configure its network address translators (NATs) or firewalls, change their ways in translating and forwarding IP packets, and eventually facilitate its communications with remote hosts.  However, the un-controlled generation or deletion of IP address mappings on such network devices may cause security risks and should be avoided.  Before a PCP request is eventually executed, the requester needs to prove that it is a legal PCP user and has a sufficient privilege.  This document proposes an in-band authentication mechanism for PCP.  The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is taken advantage of to perform authentication between PCP devices.</t></abstract>
