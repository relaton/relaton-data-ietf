<abstract><t>As the deployment of third and fourth generation cellular networks progresses, a large number of cellular hosts are being connected to the Internet.  Standardization organizations are making Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) mandatory in their specifications. However, the concept of IPv6 covers many aspects and numerous specifications.  In addition, the characteristics of cellular links in terms of bandwidth, cost and delay put special requirements on how IPv6 is used.  This document considers IPv6 for cellular hosts that attach to the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), or Evolved Packet System (EPS) networks (Hereafter collectively referred to as 3GPP networks).  This document also lists out specific IPv6 functionality that needs to be implemented in addition what is already prescribed in the IPv6 Node Requirements document.  It also discusses some issues relating to the use of these components when operating in these networks.  This document obsoletes RFC 3316.</t></abstract>
