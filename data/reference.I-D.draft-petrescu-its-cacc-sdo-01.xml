<abstract><t>This document describes the use-cases of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control, and Platooning, as defined by several Standards Development Organizations such as ETSI, IEEE 1609, SAE and 3GPP.  C-ACC and Platooning involve concepts of direct vehicle-to-vehicle, and device-to-device communications, which are developped by 3GPP and precursory by the METIS EU project.  They are illustrated very clearly in emergency settings such as FirstNet.  IP messages - instead of link-layer messages - are pertinent for C-ACC and Platooning use-cases because applications for road safety such as WAZE, iRezQ and Coyote (currently involving infrastructure) are IP messages, and proved succesful in deployments.  Applications such as Sentinel are direct between vehicles but are not IP, currently.</t></abstract>
