<abstract><t>The Media Server Markup Language (MSML) is used to control and invoke many different types of services on IP media servers.  The MSML control interface was initially driven by RadiSys with subsequent significant contributions from Intel, Dialogic, and others in the industry.  Clients can use it to define how multimedia sessions interact on a media server and to apply services to individuals or groups of users.  MSML can be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams.  As well, clients can use MSML to define media processing dialogs, which may be used as parts of application interactions with users or conferences.  Transformation of media streams to and from users or conferences as well as interactive voice response (IVR) dialogs are examples of such interactions, which are specified using MSML.  MSML clients may also invoke dialogs with individual users or with groups of conference participants using VoiceXMLThis document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
