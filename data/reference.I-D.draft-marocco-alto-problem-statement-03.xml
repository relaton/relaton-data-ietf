<abstract><t>A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by peer-to-peer applications used, for example, for file sharing, realtime communications and live media streaming.  Such applications often deal with large amounts of data in direct peer-to-peer connections, but they usually have little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  As a result, they may choose their peers based on measurements and statistics which, in some situations, may lead to suboptimal choices.  This document describes problem related to optimizing traffic generated by peer-to-peer applications through the use of network-layer information, provides a representative set of use cases that may exhibit this problem, and outlines considerations that have to be taken in account when arriving at equitable solutions.</t></abstract>
