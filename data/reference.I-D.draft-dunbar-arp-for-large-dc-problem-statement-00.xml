<abstract><t>Virtual machines, or virtualized servers, basically allow one physical server to support multiple hosts (20, 30, or hundreds of). As virtual machines are introduced to Data center, the number of hosts within one data center can grow dramatically, which could create tremendous impact to networks and hosts.  This document describes reasons why it is still desirable to have virtual machines in Data Center to be in one Layer 2 network and potential problems this type of Layer 2 network will face. The goal is to justify why it is necessary for IETF to create a working group to work on interoperable and scalable solutions for data center(s) with large number of virtual machines.</t></abstract>
