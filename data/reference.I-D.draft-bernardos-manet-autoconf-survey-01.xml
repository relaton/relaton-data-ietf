<abstract><t>This Internet Draft aims at providing a general reference for the AUTOCONF solution space. We present most of the previously proposed IP AUTOCONF mechanisms in MANETs, classifying them according to a number of useful criteria, conforming to the AUTOCONF problem statement draft and the MANET architecture draft. Furthermore, an analysis of each proposed solution is carried out illustrating its key characteristics, advantages and correspondence to the classification criteria.</t></abstract>
