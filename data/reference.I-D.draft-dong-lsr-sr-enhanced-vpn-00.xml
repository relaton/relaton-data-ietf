<abstract><t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated with 5G services.  These applications require better isolation and have more stringent performance requirements than that can be provided with traditional overlay VPNs.  An enhanced VPN may form the underpin of 5G transport network slicing, and will also be of use in its own right.  This document describes how Multi- Topology Routing (MTR) as described in RFC 5120 and RFC 4915, can be extended to signal the resources allocated in the underlay network to construct the virtual networks for enhanced VPN services, together with the Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs) used to identify and access the network resources allocated for the virtual networks in the data plane.</t></abstract>
