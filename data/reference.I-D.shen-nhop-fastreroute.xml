<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism called NFRR (Nexthop Fast ReRoute) to perform fast re-route for any type of traffic in the event of a link/node failure or a nexthop unreachable. The protected traffic can be IP, MPLS, unicast or multicast. The re-routed traffic can either be destined to the nexthop router or to the next-nexthop router. RSVP explicitly routed LSPs are used as a tool to perform the local patch for minimizing the packet loss.</t></abstract>
