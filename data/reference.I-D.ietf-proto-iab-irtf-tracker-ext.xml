<abstract><t>This document describes the states which need to be added to the I-D tracker to make it possible for IAB and IRTF document shepherds (whoever the IAB and IRTF designate, e.g. the IAB Chair, RG Chairs) to update the I-D tracker during document shepherding. It is a companion document of draft-proto-wgchair-tracker-ext which describes additional requirements for the chairs to use the I-D tracker for managing WG documents from their earliest stages.</t></abstract>
