<abstract><t>This memo provides application-specific requirements for the Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process. From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light path computation. Requirements related to optical impairments will be addressed in a separate document.</t></abstract>
