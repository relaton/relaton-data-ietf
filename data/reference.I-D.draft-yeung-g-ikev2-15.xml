<abstract><t>This document presents a set of IKEv2 exchanges that comprise a group key management protocol.  The protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) key management architecture, which contains two components: member registration and group rekeying.  Both components require a Group Controller/Key Server to download IPsec group security associations to authorized members of a group.  The group members then exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets.  This document obsoletes RFC 6407.</t></abstract>
