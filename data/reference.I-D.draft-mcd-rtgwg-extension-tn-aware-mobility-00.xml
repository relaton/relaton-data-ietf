<abstract><t>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G [TN-AWARE- MOBILITY] draft specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems Slice and Service Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths in IP and Layer 2 Transport networks.The focus of that work is limited to the mobility domain and transport network characteristics till the UPF and doesn't go beyond the UPF to the Data Network.</t><t> To maintain E2E transport network characteristics the framework needs to be extended beyond UPF. This document describes a framework for extending the mobility aware transport network characteristics from the UPF through the Data Network.</t></abstract>
