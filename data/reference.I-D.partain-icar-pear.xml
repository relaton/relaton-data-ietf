<abstract><t>This memo proposes a lightweight and incremental approach to improving early cross-area review in the IETF. This proposal has two specific goals. Firstly, the current perception is that the IETF standardization process is bogged down and takes far too long. One factor in this slowness appears to be the workload placed upon the IESG when documents are brought to them. Given that one role of the IESG has been to provide cross-area review, offloading some portion of that work may increase the speed of the process. Secondly, cross-area review done early in the process may be a good tool for identifying significant problems with a Working Group's efforts long before the documents reach the IESG. As such, the early cross-area review can improve the quality of the output from the Working Group by sifting the wheat from the chaff.</t></abstract>
