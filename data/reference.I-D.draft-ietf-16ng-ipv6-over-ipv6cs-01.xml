<abstract><t>The IEEE 802.16d/e has specified several convergence sublayers which are a part of the MAC that can be used for carrying IPv6 packets. The IPv6 convergence sublayer enables transport of IPv6 packets directly over the MAC. Between the 802.16d/e host and the base station IPv6 packets are carried over a MAC layer transport connection which is a virtual point-to-point link. This document specifies the addressing and operation of IPv6 hosts served by a network that utilizes the 802.16d/e air interface. It recommends the assignment of a unique prefix to each host and allow the host to use multiple identifiers within that prefix, including support for randomly generated identifiers.</t></abstract>
