<abstract><t>SNMP and the Internet Standard Management Framework are widely used for management of communication devices, creating needs to specify SNMP access (including access to SNMP MIB object instances) from non-SNMP management environments. For example, when out-of-band IP management is used via a separate management interface (e.g., for a device that does not support in-band IP access) there is a need for a uniform way to indicate how to contact the device for management. URIs fit this need well, as they allow a single text string to indicate a management access communication endpoint for a wide variety of IP-based protocols.</t></abstract>
