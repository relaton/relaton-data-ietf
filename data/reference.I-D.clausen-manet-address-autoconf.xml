<abstract><t>In this draft, a simple autoconfiguration mechanism for MANETs is developed. The mechanism aims at solving the simple, but common, problem of one or more new nodes emerging in an existing network. A solution is proposed, which allows these new nodes to acquire an address and participate in the network. The method is simple, both algorithmically and in the requirements to the network. While this is a partial solution to the general autoconfiguration problem, the mechanism described in this draft can satisfy the requirements for a great number of real-world situations. Though examples are given with OLSR [1] [11] being the routing protocol in use, nothing prevents the described mechanisms to work along with other routing protocols.</t></abstract>
