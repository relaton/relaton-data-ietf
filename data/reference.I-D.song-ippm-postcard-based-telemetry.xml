<abstract><t>The document describes a packet-marking variation of the Postcard- Based Telemetry (PBT), referred to as PBT-M.  Unlike the instruction- based PBT, as embodied in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-direct-export], PBT-M does not require the encapsulation of a telemetry instruction header, so it avoids some of the implementation challenges of the instruction-based PBT.  However, PBT-M has unique issues that need to be considered.  This document serves as a scheme overview and provides design guidelines applicable to implementations in different network protocols.</t></abstract>
