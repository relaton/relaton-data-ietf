<abstract><t>This document specifies a CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates.  The resulting certificates are called C509 Certificates.  The CBOR encoding supports a large subset of RFC 5280 and significantly reduces the size of certificates compatible with e.g.  RFC 7925, IEEE 802.1AR (DevID), CNSA, and CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements. When used to re-encode DER encoded X.509 certificates, the CBOR encoding can in many cases reduce the size of RFC 7925 profiled certificates with over 50%.  The CBOR encoded structure can alternatively be signed directly (&quot;natively signed&quot;), which does not require re-encoding for the signature to be verified.  The document also specifies COSE headers as well as a TLS certificate type for C509 certificates.</t><t> NOTE: &quot;C509&quot; is a placeholder, name to be decided by the COSE WG.</t></abstract>
