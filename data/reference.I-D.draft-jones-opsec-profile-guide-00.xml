<abstract><t>This document provides guidelines for creating security capability profiles. A profile is a list of features that are required to operate a device in a a secure manner in a specific environment. It is anticipated that what is required in a profile will vary over time and, across different classes of devices (e.g. a network edge device may need to filter customer traffic whereas core network devices may not), and in different organizations. This document does not define a profile or specify requirements, but rather gives guidance for their creation.</t></abstract>
