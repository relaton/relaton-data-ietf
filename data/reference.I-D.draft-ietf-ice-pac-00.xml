<abstract><t>During the process of creating a peer-to-peer connection, ICE implementations can encounter situations where they have no candidate pairs to check, and, as a result, conclude that ICE processing has failed.  However, because additional candidate pairs can be discovered during ICE processing, declaring failure at this point may be premature.  This document discusses when these situations can occur and proposes a way to avoid premature failure.</t></abstract>
