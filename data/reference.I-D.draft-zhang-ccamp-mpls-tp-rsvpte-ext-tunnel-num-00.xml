<abstract><t>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) identifiers document [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] introduce two tunnel numbers, A1- Tunnel_Num and Z9-Tunnel_Num, which allow a compact format for Maintenance Entity Point Identifier (MEP_ID).  For some Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions, such as Connectivity Verification (CV) [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-cc-cv-rdi], source MEP_ID MUST be inserted in the OAM packets, so that the peer endpoint can compare the received and expected MEP_IDs to judge whether there is a mismatch, which means that the two MEP nodes need to pre-store each other's MEP_IDs.  The specification of setting up co-routed bidirectional LSP is described in the document [RFC3473], which does not introduce the locally configured tunnel number on the tunnel endpoint.  This document defines the Connection object to exchange the tunnel numbers.</t></abstract>
