<abstract><t>This document introduces a framework for mobility management protocols in terms of their key, abstract logical functions.  We explain how the framework is capable of presenting a unified view, reducing the clutter that prevents a casual reader from understanding the commonalities between different approaches in mobility management.  A first order application of this framework is to enable us to examine previously standardized mobility management protocols, such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well as several of their extensions), and describe their core functionality in terms of different configurations of the logical functions defined by the framework.</t></abstract>
