<abstract><t>In multiconnectivity scenarios the end-user devices can simultaneously connect to multiple networks based on different access technologies and network architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL.  Both the quality of experience of the users and the overall network utilization and efficiency may be improved through a smart selection and combination of access and core network paths that can dynamically adapt to changing network conditions.  This document presents the problem statement and proposes solution principles.  It specifies the requirements and architecture for the multi-access management services framework that can be used to 1) flexibly select the best combination of access and core network paths for uplink and downlink, as well as 2) determining the user plane treatment and traffic distribution over the selected links ensuring better network efficiency and enhanced application performance.</t></abstract>
