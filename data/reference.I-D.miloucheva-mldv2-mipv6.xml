<abstract><t>Protocol mechanisms for fast mobile multicast in IPv6 based on multicast listening context transfer are proposed. The focus is the context transfer for mobile multicast listeners using Multicast Listener Discovery protocol Version 2 (MLDv2). Multicast context transfer block and operational considerations for optimised multicast context transfer based on Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 and Candidate Access Router Discovery are described. The requirements for MLDv2 context extension and operation at access routers to support multicast context transfer for mobile IPv6 are specified. Interactions of MLDv2 with Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) for multicast routing state update based on multicast listening context transfer are overviewed. Operational considerations for MLDv2 and PIM-SM to support multicast receiver and source mobility based on context transfer are discussed. Comparison with other multicast protocol proposals for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is given.</t></abstract>
