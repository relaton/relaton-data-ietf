<abstract><t>A scalable VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model with E-Tree support is proposed in this document. In this model, a Tree VSI is introduced which can provide connectivity for both root VLAN and leaf VLAN for the E-Tree service. MAC address based Ethernet forwarding engine works in the same way as before. As VLAN mapping is needed in the Ethernet PW to keep the VLAN domains in different PEs of the same VPLS instance independent, the PW processing needed for this kind of VLAN mapping is also discussed.</t></abstract>
