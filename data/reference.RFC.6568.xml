<abstract><t>This document investigates potential application scenarios and use cases for low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs).  This document provides dimensions of design space for LoWPAN applications. A list of use cases and market domains that may benefit and motivate the work currently done in the 6LoWPAN Working Group is provided with the characteristics of each dimension.  A complete list of practical use cases is not the goal of this document.  This document is not an  Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for  informational purposes.</t></abstract>
