<abstract><t>This document outlines the security requirements for a Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) overlay network.  It compares security difference between client/server (C/S) and P2P implementations of SIP, partitions the P2PSIP architecture into layers and analyzes the security issues in each layer and the security relationship among the layers.  This draft also classifies the application scenarios into two main types and then analyzes in detail the security threats with these two types of scenarios.  In the end, it summarizes the main security requirements for the P2PSIP architecture and its components.  This draft is a merge of features from the P2PSIP security requirements draft and the P2PSIP security analysis and evaluation draft and is still a work in progress.</t></abstract>
