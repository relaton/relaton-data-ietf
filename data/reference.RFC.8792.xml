<abstract><t>This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded text content.  One strategy, called the &quot;single backslash&quot; strategy, is based on the historical use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line-folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first character that is not a space character (' ') on the next line.  The second strategy, called the &quot;double backslash&quot; strategy, extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and is thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content.</t></abstract>
