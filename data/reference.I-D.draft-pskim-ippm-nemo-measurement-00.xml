<abstract><t>In this draft, the new measurement scheme of IP performance metrics is proposed for the mobile network in heterogeneous wireless network environment. In the proposed scheme, all mobile nodes (MNs) inside the mobile network can get IP performance metrics irrespective of the presence or absence of measurement functionality. That is, the proposed scheme does not require the MN to be involved in measuring IP performance metrics. The multihomed mobile router (MR) with heterogeneous wireless interfaces measures IP performance metrics on behalf of the MNs inside the mobile network. Then, when MNs want to understand the condition of multiple communication paths, MNs can get measured IP performance metrics from the MR using L3 messages. The proposed scheme can reduce burden and power consumption of MNs with limited resource and battery power since MNs don't measure directly IP performance metrics. In addition, the proposed scheme can reduce considerably traffic overhead over wireless links on measurement paths since signaling messages and injected testing traffic are reduced.</t></abstract>
