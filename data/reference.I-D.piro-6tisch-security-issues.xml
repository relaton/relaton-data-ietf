<abstract><t>The aim of this Internet Draft is to define standard compliant procedures for configuring layer-2 security services in IEEE 802.15.4e-based Low-power and Lossy Networks. In particular, it provides a review of security aspects presented in both IEEE 802.15.4-2011 and IEEE 802.15.4e-2012 specifications, the classification of secure network configurations and layer-2 keys, the description of a set of consecutive steps required to establish a layer-2 secure link, and a lightweight Key Management Protocol designed  for negotiating a layer-2 one-hop link key. As the final goal, the document would describe how security MAC attributes can by initialized and updated in order to offer layer-2 security services in real networks.</t></abstract>
