<abstract><t>In the 802.16 Per-MS prefix model, one prefix can only be assigned to one mobile station by an access router and different mobile stations can't share a prefix. Managing Per-MS prefixes is likely to increase the processing load at the access router. Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique in which the access router offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes to an DHCPv6 server. The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile station to the DHCPv6 server. The access router next advertises the prefix information to the mobile station with a Router Advertisement message. When the mobile station leaves, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server. We also describe how prefix delegation can be done by AAA servers as an alternative technique.</t></abstract>
