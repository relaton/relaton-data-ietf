<abstract><t>For Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (C-ACC), platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, direct IP communication between neighbor vehicles poses the following two issues: 1) how to discover a neighbor vehicle and the demanded service; and 2) how to discover the link-layer address of the neighbor vehicle and selected server.  This document presents a solution to these problems based on DNS-SD/mDNS [RFC6762][RFC6763].</t></abstract>
