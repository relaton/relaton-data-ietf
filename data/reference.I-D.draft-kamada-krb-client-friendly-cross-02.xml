<abstract><t>This document proposes a cross-realm traversal model, which is suitable for resource-limited clients, for Kerberos Version 5. This model provides a way to move the cost of consecutive Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) exchanges from clients to Key Distribution Centers (KDCs) and a way to reduce the traversal cost by generating a direct inter-realm relationship between two realms. The document describes behavior of clients and KDCs, but does not specify any wire format, which need to be specified separately.</t></abstract>
