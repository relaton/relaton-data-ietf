<abstract><t>The Internet Society (ISOC) has declared that June 8th 2011 will be World IPv6 Day, on which organisations are being encouraged to test their production IPv6 deployment capability.  Many significant content providers and networks have stated they will take part. Given this date is likely to see more IPv6 traffic flowing across the Internet than has ever been seen before, it seems timely to issue a call to arms for operators and administrators to review and mitigate common causes of IPv6 connectivity problems.  The increased traffic on World IPv6 Day should also create an excellent opportunity to observe the behaviour and performance of IPv6; it is thus very desirable to have appropriate measurement tools in place in advance. We discuss some appropriate tools from the network and application perspective.</t></abstract>
