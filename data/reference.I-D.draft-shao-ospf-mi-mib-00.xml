<abstract><t>The OSPF MIB defined by the IETF (RFC 1850) was designed to work with only one OSPF process/instance on a given router.  It currently doesn't offer a mechanism to access ospf mib obejects of different instances.  For example, there is only a single ospfRouterId object, not a table of them.  In order to handle multiple instances, RFC 4750 suggests that you use SNMPv3 contexts to provide per-instance views.  This document introduces a way for OSPF MIB to support multiple instance, no mater in SNMPv2 or SNMPv3 contexts, by adding the object ospfProcId into every OSPF MIB group.  According to the specified ospfProcId, other obejects in this OSPF instance can be accessed.</t></abstract>
