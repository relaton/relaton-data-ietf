<abstract><t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) is applicable to a wide range of devices in a variety of environments. The emergence of Web Services gives one such environment, and is presently characterized by the use of the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). NETCONF finds many benefits in this environment: from the re-use of existing standards, to ease of software development, to integration with deployed systems. Herein, we describe SOAP over HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol) and SOAP over BEEP (Blocks Exchange Extensible Protocol) bindings for NETCONF.</t></abstract>
