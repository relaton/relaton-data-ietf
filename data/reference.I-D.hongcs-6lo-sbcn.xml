<abstract><t>Recent advances in Internet of Things(IoT) have increased the usage of sensing technologies. Breakthroughs is microelectronics have increased the use of wearable devices to monitor human body functions and its surroundings. A typical wearable device has low resources in terms of power and processing capabilities. Reducing the energy consumption is one of the key design factors in a wearable network so that the devices may work for longer duration. Idle listening and overhearing are major causes of energy consumption. These issues can be resolved by maximizing the sleeping time of a device (switched off) and avoid unnecessary wakeup time (idle listening) to save energy. An external wakeup scheduling to handle the sleep/wakeup cycle of a device can be adapted. This document describes how a 2wakeup scheduling using an out-of-bound external wake up mechanism can work to successfully increase the lifetime of a typical body-centric wearable network (S-BCN).</t></abstract>
