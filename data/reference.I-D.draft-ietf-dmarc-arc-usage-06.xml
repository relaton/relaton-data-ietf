<abstract><t>The Authentication Received Chain (ARC) provides an authenticated "chain of custody" for a message, allowing each entity that handles the message to see what entities handled it before, and to see what the message's authentication assessment was at each step in the handling.  But the specification does not indicate how the entities handling these messages should interpret or utilize ARC results in making decisions about message disposition.  This document will provide guidance in these areas.</t></abstract>
