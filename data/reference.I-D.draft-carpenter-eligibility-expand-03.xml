<abstract><t>This document defines a process experiment under RFC 3933 that temporarily updates the criteria for qualifying volunteers to participate in the IETF Nominating Committee.  It therefore also updates the criteria for qualifying signatories to a community recall petition.  The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible in view of increasing remote participation in the IETF and a probable decline in face-to-face meetings.  This document temporarily varies the rules in RFC 8713.</t></abstract>
