<abstract><t>The use of IPv6 addresses by large organizations doesn't fit the commonly used PA/PI dichotomy.  Such organizations may hold a large address block which is deaggregated into subprefixes that are advertised by subunits of the organization.  This document proposes a set of best practices to allow this deaggregation to be controlled through filtering so that on the one hand, the size of the IPv6 global routing table isn't unduly inflated, while on the other hand organizations that seek to deaggregate a large IPv6 address block don't see their reachability limited by remote filters.</t></abstract>
