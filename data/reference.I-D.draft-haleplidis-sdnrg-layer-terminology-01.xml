<abstract><t>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new approach for network programmability.  Network programmability refers to the ability to control, change, and manage network behavior dynamically through software via open interfaces as opposed to relying on closed boxes and propietary defined interfaces.  SDN introduces an abstraction for the data forwarding plane and by doing so separates it from the control plane.  This separation allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as experience has already shown.  However, there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what is the layer structure in an SDN architecture and how do layers interface with each other.  This document does not aim to standardize any layers or interfaces but rather aims to answer these questions and provide a concise reference document for SDNRG in particular and the SDN community in general.</t></abstract>
