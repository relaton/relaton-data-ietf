<abstract><t>The productive output of IETF working groups is documents, as mandated by the working group's charter.  When a working group is ready to develop a particular document it usually "adopts" it as a working group draft.  The document that a working group adopts and then develops further is based on initial input at varying levels of maturity.  An initial working group draft might be a document already in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the working group, or it might represent any level of maturity in between.  This document discusses typicals aspects of a working group's handling of its formal documents, which are targeted for publication.</t></abstract>
