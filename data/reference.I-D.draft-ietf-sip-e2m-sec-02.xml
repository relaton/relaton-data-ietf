<abstract><t>Some services provided by intermediaries depend on their ability to inspect a message body in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). When sensitive information is included in the message body, a SIP User Agent (UA) needs to protect it from other intermediaries than those that the UA agreed to disclose it to. This document proposes a mechanism for securing information passed between an end user and intermediaries using S/MIME. It also proposes mechanisms for a UA to discover intermediaries which need to inspect an S/MIME-secured message body, or to receive the message body with data integrity.</t></abstract>
