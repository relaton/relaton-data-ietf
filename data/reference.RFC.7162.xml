<abstract><t>Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes to a common IMAP mailbox.  Examples include different clients working on behalf of the same user and multiple users accessing shared mailboxes.  These clients need a mechanism to efficiently synchronize state changes for messages within the mailbox.</t><t>Initially defined in RFC 4551, the Conditional Store facility provides a protected update mechanism for message state information and a mechanism for requesting only changes to the message state. This memo updates that mechanism and obsoletes RFC 4551, based on operational experience.</t><t>This document additionally updates another IMAP extension, Quick Resynchronization, which builds on the Conditional STORE extension to provide an IMAP client the ability to fully resynchronize a mailbox as part of the SELECT/EXAMINE command, without the need for additional server-side state or client round trips.  Hence, this memo obsoletes RFC 5162.</t><t>Finally, this document also updates the line-length recommendation in Section 3.2.1.5 of RFC 2683.</t></abstract>
