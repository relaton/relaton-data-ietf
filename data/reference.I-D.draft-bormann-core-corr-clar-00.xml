<abstract><t>RFC 7252 defines the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), along with a number of additional specifications, including RFC 7641, RFC 7959, RFC 8132, and RFC 8323.  RFC 6690 defines the link format that is used in CoAP self-description documents.  Some parts of the specification may be unclear or even contain errors that may lead to misinterpretations that may impair interoperability between different implementations.  The present document provides corrections, additions, and clarifications to the RFCs cited; this document thus updates these RFCs.  In addition, other clarifications related to the use of CoAP in other specifications, including RFC 7390 and RFC 8075, are also provided.</t></abstract>
