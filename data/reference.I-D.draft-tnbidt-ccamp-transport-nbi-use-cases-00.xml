<abstract><t>Transport network domains, including Optical Transport Network (OTN) and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, are typically deployed based on a single vendor or technology platforms. They are often managed using proprietary interfaces to dedicated Element Management Systems (EMS), Network Management Systems (NMS) and increasingly Software Defined Network (SDN) controllers.  A well-defined open interface to each domain management system or controller is required for network operators to facilitate control automation and orchestrate end-to-end services across multi-domain networks. These functions may enabled using standardized data models (e.g. YANG), and appropriate protocol (e.g., RESTCONF).  This document describes the key use cases and requirements for transport network control and management. It reviews proposed and existing IETF transport network data models, their applicability, and highlights gaps and requirements.</t></abstract>
