<abstract><t>This draft presents a fault notification protocol for use in a GMPLS- based failure recovery scheme. The protocol guarantees recovery path(s) activation in a bounded time in the event of single resource failures. These failures include fiber cut, transponder failure and node failure. Bounded recovery time is achieved by pre-signaling recovery paths whose nodes can be reached within a specific time, based on the physical capabilities of the nodes and the delay characteristics of the control plane. We propose using a flooding protocol for fault notification to allow for per-failure notification and to speed up the recovery process. We justify choices made for the notification method and the messaging required for the protocol. The draft does not mandate a specific implementation of the Fault Notification Protocol.</t></abstract>
