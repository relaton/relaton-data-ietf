<abstract><t>Requirements for providing the End to End(E2E) performance assurance are emerging within the service provider network.  While there are various technology solutions, there is no one solution which can fulfill these requirements for a native IP network.  One universal (E2E) solution which can cover both intra-domain and inter-domain scenarios is needed.  One feasible E2E traffic engineering solution is the use of a Path Computation Elements (PCE) in a native IP network.  This document describes various complex scenarios and simulation results when applying a PCE in a native IP network.  This solution, referred to as Centralized Control Dynamic Routing (CCDR), integrates the advantage of using distributed protocols and the power of a centralized control technology.</t></abstract>
