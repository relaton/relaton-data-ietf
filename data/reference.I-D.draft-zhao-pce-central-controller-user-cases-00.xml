<abstract><t>In certain deployment networks deployment scenarios, service providers would like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and GMPLS network while removing the complexity of existing signaling protocols such as LDP and RSVP-TE.  In this document, we propose to use the PCE as a central controller so that LSP can be calculated/signaled/initiated/downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network devices along the LSP path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.  This draft describes the user cases for using the PCE as the central controller where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated/downloaded through extending the existing PCE architectures and extending the PCEP.</t></abstract>
