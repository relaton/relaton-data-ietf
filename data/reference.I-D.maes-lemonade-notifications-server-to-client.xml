<abstract><t>Lemonade server to client notifications and filtering provides some extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for optimization in a mobile setting, aimed at delivering extended functionality for mobile devices with limited resources. These notifications support pushing changes actively to a client, rather than requiring the client to initiate contact to ask for state changes. Filtering allows setting and controlling which email and events are notified to or synchronized with the mobile client.</t></abstract>
