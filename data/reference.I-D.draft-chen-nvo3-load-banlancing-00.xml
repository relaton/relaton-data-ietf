<abstract><t>Traditional ECMP can not balance loads well in the data center network because it splits loads at the granularity of flow.  Packets belong to a single flow have to be delivered along the same path. Though it is able to avoid packet reordering, it may degrade the bandwidth utilization.  This document describes method of splitting a single flow to across multiple parallel paths without causing packet reordering, which is more effective when large flows exist.  The specific path selection algorithm is NOT discussed in this document.</t></abstract>
