<abstract><t>The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is a protocol that allows a mobile node (MN) to maintain connectivity with a correspondent node (CN) via the Internet while changing its point of attachment. In MIPv6, a MN cannot know which packet is the last packet with the previous CoA (PCoA) as the destination address. In this draft, we define the format and the usage of the Flush message, in order for the MN to know the last packet with the PCoA as the destination address sent by the home agent (HA) and/or a CN.</t></abstract>
