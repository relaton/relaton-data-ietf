<abstract><t>Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that a certain domain name does not exist.  It is also used to signal that a domain name exists, but does not have the specific RR type you were asking for.  When returning a negative DNSSEC response, a name server usually includes up to two NSEC records.  With NSEC3 this amount is three.  This document provides extra documentation and context on the mechanisms behind NSEC and NSEC3</t></abstract>
