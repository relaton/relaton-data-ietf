<abstract><t>The IPv6 address range of 0::/64 is reserved for loopback addresses. This expands from the single loophack address already defined for IPv6, ::1, to allow for a set of addresses to be used when packets are intended to stay within a host system.  Multiple loopback addresses allow for simultaneous varied uses of the loopback addresses as has proven, albeit in limited ways, in IPv4.  And exception is made to accomodate the ::0/128, already defined as The Unspecified Address.</t></abstract>
