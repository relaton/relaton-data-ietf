<abstract><t>Emergency calling works best when precise location is available for emergency call routing.  However, there are situations in which a location provider is unable or unwilling to provide precise location, yet still wishes to enable subscribers to make emergency calls.  This document describes the level of location accuracy that providers must provide to enable emergency call routing.  In addition, we descibe how emergency services and non-emergency services can be invoked by an endpoint that does not have access to its precise location.</t></abstract>
