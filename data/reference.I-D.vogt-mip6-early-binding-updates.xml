<abstract><t>The long latency associated with Mobile IPv6's home-address and care-of-address tests can significantly impact delay-sensitive applications. We propose a modified binding-update procedure that evades the latency of both address tests. The modified binding update runs in half, or less, of the time that a standard binding update takes. Moreover, the modified binding update is nearly equivalent to the standard procedure with respect to security, and it increases the resources required at the correspondent node only marginally. The modification is realized as an optional, and fully backward-compatible, extension to Mobile IPv6.</t></abstract>
