<abstract><t>Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and IPv6-only hosts at the same time.  Such networks also want to IPv6/ IPv4 translation for the IPv6-only host so it can access servers on the IPv4 Internet.  On such a network, the synthesized AAAA responses from a DNS64 can cause traffic to be translated.  This document describes a solution to avoid that translation when the application uses DNS.</t></abstract>
