<abstract><t>The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API) offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms.  This document updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in &quot;Generic Security Service API Version 2 : Java Bindings&quot; (RFC 2853). This document obsoletes RFC 2853 by making specific and incremental clarifications and corrections to it in response to identification of transcription errors and implementation experience.</t><t>The GSS-API is described at a language-independent conceptual level in &quot;Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1&quot; (RFC 2743).  The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis.  Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS-API are &quot;The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism&quot; (RFC 2025) and &quot;The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2&quot; (RFC 4121).
