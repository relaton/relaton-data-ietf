<abstract><t>This memo describes an application-level protocol for the communication of end-to-end QoS compliance information based on the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The Quality for Service (Q4S) protocol provides a mechanism to negotiate and monitor latency, jitter, bandwidth, and packet loss, and to alert whenever one of the negotiated conditions is violated.</t><t>Implementation details on the actions to be triggered upon reception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are out of scope of this document; it is either application dependent (e.g., act to increase quality or reduce bit-rate) or network dependent (e.g., change connection's quality profile).</t><t>This protocol specification is the product of research conducted over a number of years; it is presented here as a permanent record and to offer a foundation for future similar work.  It does not represent a standard protocol and does not have IETF consensus.</t></abstract>
