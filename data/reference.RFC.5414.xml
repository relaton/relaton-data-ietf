<abstract><t>The popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) has led to widespread deployments across different establishments.  It has also translated into an increasing scale of the WLANs.  Large-scale deployments made of large numbers of wireless termination points (WTPs) and covering substantial areas are increasingly common.</t><t>The Wireless LAN Control Protocol (WiCoP) described in this document allows for the control and provisioning of large-scale WLANs.  It enables central management of these networks and realizes the objectives set forth for the Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP).  This document defines a Historic Document for  the Internet community.</t></abstract>
