<abstract><t>In an increasingly complex internet it is becoming more common for endpoints to want to influence the behavior of network devices, and for those devices to want to communicate with endpoints for autho- rization and policy discover. Frameworks and protocols are evolv- ing for communication with application intermediaries and with net- work edge policy enforcement devices. One area that has received relatively little attention to date is communication between end- points and transport intermediaries. This document presents a problem statement and an overview of different communication mod- els.</t></abstract>
