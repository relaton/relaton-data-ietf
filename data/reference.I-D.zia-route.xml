<abstract><t>The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport protocol (ROUTE Protocol) is specified for robust delivery of application objects, including application objects with real-time delivery constraints, to receivers over a unidirectional transport. Application objects consist of data that has meaning to applications that use the ROUTE Protocol for delivery of data to receivers, for example, it can be a file, or a DASH or HLS segment, a WAV audio clip, etc. The ROUTE Protocol also supports low-latency streaming applications.  The ROUTE Protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast, and multicast transport. Therefore, it can be run over IP/UDP including multicast IP. ROUTE Protocol can leverage the features of the underlying protocol layer, e.g. to provide security it can leverage IP security protocols such as IPSec.</t></abstract>
