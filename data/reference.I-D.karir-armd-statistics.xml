<abstract><t>As large scale data centers continue to grow with an ever-increasing number of virtual and physical servers there is a need to re- evaluate performance at the network edge.  Performance is often critical for large scale data center scale applications and it is important to minimize any unnecessary latency or load in order to streamline the operation of services at such large scales.  To extract maximum performance from these applications it is important to optimize and tune all the layers in the data center stack.  One critical area that requires particular attention is the link-layer address resolution protocol that maps an IP address with the specific hardware address at the edge of the network.  The goal of this document is to characterize this problem space in detail in order to better understand the scale of the problem as well as to identify particular scenarios where address resolution might have greater adverse impact on performance.</t></abstract>
