<abstract><t>IGMP is used by IPv4 system to report their multicast group memberships to multicast routers. This document adds support for router annoucing information, that is, the ability for a multicast router to annouce information about a group to host. For example, some hosts may send reports to join a group that do not exist, so the router would send some message to inform the hosts.</t></abstract>
