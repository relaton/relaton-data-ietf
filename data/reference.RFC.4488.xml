<title>Suppression of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER Method Implicit Subscription</title>
<author initials='O.' surname='Levin' fullname='O. Levin'><organization /></author>
<date year='2006' month='May' />
<abstract><t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) REFER extension as defined in RFC 3515 automatically establishes a typically short-lived event subscription used to notify the party sending a REFER request about the receiver's status in executing the transaction requested by the REFER.  These notifications are not needed in all cases.  This specification provides a way to prevent the automatic establishment of an event subscription and subsequent notifications using a new SIP extension header field that may be included in a REFER request.
