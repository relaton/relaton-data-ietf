<abstract><t>This document contains recommendations on how providers of email services can effect and manage the transition of email services from IPv4 to IPv6.  It is expected that this will be effected over a period of years and it is unlikely that any transition will completely exclude the ongoing possibility of using IPv4 as a transport mechanism for email.  This provides one possible plan for transitioning email services on the Internet from a predominantly IPv4-based connectivity model to a predominantly IPv6-based connectivity model.</t></abstract>
