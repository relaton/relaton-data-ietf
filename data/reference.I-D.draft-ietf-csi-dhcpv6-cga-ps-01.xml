<abstract><t>This document describes potential issues in the interaction between DHCPv6 and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs). Firstly, the scenario of using CGAs in DHCPv6 environments is discussed.   Some operations are clarified for the interaction of DHCPv6 servers and CGA-associated hosts. We then also discuss how CGAs and DHCPv6 may have mutual benefits for each other, including using CGAs in DHCPv6 operations to enhance its security features and using DHCPv6 to provide the CGA generation function.</t></abstract>
