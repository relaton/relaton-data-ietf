<abstract><t>ATTENTION: This memo contains a DRAFT proposal for the IANA to assume operational responsibilities relating to the management of the Timezone (TZ) Database.  The authors seek comment and review of this proposal.  No action will be taken without rough consensus of the TZ community.  The Timezone (TZ) Database consists of timezone information for all localities throughout the world.  This database has been meticulously maintained and distributed free of charge by a group of volunteers, coordinated by a single volunteer who is now planning to retire. This memo specifies a DRAFT PROPOSAL for the IANA procedures involved with maintenance of the TZ database and associated code, including how to submit proposed updates, how decisions for inclusion of those updates are made, and the selection of a designated expert BY AND FOR the timezone community.  The intent of this memo is, to the extent possible, document existing practice and provide a means to ease succession.</t></abstract>
