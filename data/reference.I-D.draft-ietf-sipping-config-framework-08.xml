<abstract><t>This document defines the application of a set of protocols for providing profile data to SIP user agents. The objective is to define a means for automatically providing profile data a user agent needs to be functional without user or administrative intervention. The framework for discovery, delivery, notification and updates of user agent profile data is defined here. As part of this framework a new SIP event package is defined here for the notification of profile changes. This framework is also intended to ease ongoing administration and upgrading of large scale deployments of SIP user agents. The contents and format of the profile data to be defined is outside the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
