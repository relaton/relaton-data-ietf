<abstract><t>This document provides an overview of a framework describing the management of 6to4 [RFC3056] tunnels within a provider network.  The 6to4 provider managed tunnel, or 6to4-PMT, combines the current behavior of 6to4 [RFC3056] utilizing the IPv4 anycast based connectivity defined in [RFC3068] along with IPv6 Prefix Translation. The framework is intended to allow Service Providers an option to translate 6to4 based addresses to provider based addresses utilizing provider assigned prefixes.  The framework offers IPv6 connectivity to 6to4 compatible endpoints [RFC3056] with the advantage of a stable provider assigned prefix.  The 6to4-PMT operation is not intended to replace Native IPv6 connectivity nor 6RD, but rather provide a connectivity before such options can be deployed by an operator.</t></abstract>
