<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 deployments may want to bootstrap their operations dynamically based on an interaction between the Home Agent and the Diameter server of the Mobile Service Provider (MSP). This document specifies the interaction between a Mobile IP Home Agent and the Diameter server. Two different mechanisms for authentication of a MN to the HA are supported. The first method consists of performing the Internet Key Exchange v2 (IKEv2) protocol along with the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) with the Diameter server, while the second method utilizes the Mobile IPv6 Authentication option, as defined in RFC 4285. For Internet Key Exchange v2 with EAP-based authentication, the Diameter Mobile IPv6 application, defined in this document, reuses the commands defined in the Diameter EAP application, while for supporting the RFC 4285-style MIPv6 Authentication Options, a new Diameter application and new command codes are defined.</t></abstract>
