<abstract><t>This document describes another way to set up a PW between two ASs in the scenario of directly connected ASBR between the two ASs. The Single-Segment PW or PW Segment of a MS-PW setup between two directly connected ASBRs dose not need PSN tunnel, so as to provide a more simple way to set up inter-as PW. In the scenario described in this draft, MP-EBGP can also be used to signal the mapping of PW, then no other protocols are existed between the two ASBRs.</t></abstract>
