<abstract><t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines objects for managing RBridges, which are devices that implement the TRILL base protocol.  Since RBridges provide optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration there is no required configuration. Status information that may be helpful in network management is specified.  The MIB is specified with all objects read-only for simplicity and since that is how the MIB is expected to be used.  The description is used to indicate those objects that can be configured, although the actual configuration is outside the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
