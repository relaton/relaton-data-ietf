<abstract><t>This document defines problem statements for the Softwire Working Group to solve. At the highest level, the softwire WG is tasked to identify, and extend where necessary, standard protocols to support a selected set of IPv4 in IPv6 and IPv6 in IPv4 transition problems. This document describes the distinct problems that will be solved as part of a solution phase following the completion of this document. Some individual requirements (and non-requirements) are also identified in this document at times in order to better describe the specific scope for a given problem definition.</t></abstract>
