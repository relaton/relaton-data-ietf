<abstract><t>A long long time ago DES was standardized.  Some 30 years later (2003) is was withdrawn as a standard by NIST, today 6 years later, its time for DES to finally die.  By 2008 it was possible to brute force DES keys in 6.4 days using less than USD 10k worth of hardware. So by 2008 DES had passed its sell-by date.  Use in Kerberos should therefore stop.1.
