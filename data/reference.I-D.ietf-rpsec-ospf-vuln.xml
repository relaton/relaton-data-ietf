<abstract><t>Internet infrastructure protocols were designed at the very early stages of computer networks when "cyberspace" was still perceived as a benign environment. As a consequence, malicious attacks were not considered to be a major risk when these protocols were designed, leaving today's Internet vulnerable. This paper provides an analysis of OSPF vulnerabilities that could be exploited to modify the normal routing process across a single domain together with an assessment of when internal OSPF mechanisms can or cannot be leveraged to better secure a domain.</t></abstract>
