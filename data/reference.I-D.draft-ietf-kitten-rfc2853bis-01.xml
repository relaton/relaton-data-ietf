<abstract><t>The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API) offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in RFC 2853 [JGSS]. This document obsoletes RFC 2853 [JGSS] by making specific and incremental clarifications and corrections to it in response to identification of transcription errors and implementation experience. The only note-worthy changes are in sections 4.12.1, 6.3.2, and 6.8.1 of RFC 2853 [JGSS], which are replaced by the sections 5.12.1, 7.3.2, and 7.8.1 of this document, where numerical constants were either added or modified. The GSS-API is described at a language independent conceptual level in RFC 2743 [GSSAPIv2-UPDATE]. The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis. Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS-API are The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism [SPKM] and The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism [KERBV5].</t></abstract>
