<abstract><t>In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter- related data.  Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTP receivers usually cannot start consuming the multicast data right after they join the session.  Thus, they often experience a random acquisition delay.  One approach to reduce this delay is to use an auxiliary unicast RTP session with a retransmission server to receive a burst stream that facilitates rapid acquisition of the multicast stream.  An RTP receiver may use this approach (or any other approach) to achieve rapid acquisition.  Yet, due to various factors, performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually varies. Furthermore, in some cases the RTP receiver may (or may have to) do a simple multicast join.  For quality reporting, monitoring and diagnostics purposes, it is important to collect detailed information from the RTP receivers about their acquisition and presentation experiences.  This document addresses this issue by defining a new report block type, called Multicast Acquisition (MA) Report Block, within the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XR).  This document also defines the necessary signaling of the new MA report block type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).</t></abstract>
