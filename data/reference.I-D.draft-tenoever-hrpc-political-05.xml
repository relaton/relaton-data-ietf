<abstract><t>The IETF cannot ordain which standards or protocols are to be used on network, but the standards developing process in the IETF has a normative effect.  Among other things the standardisation work at the IETF has implications on what is perceived as technologically possible and useful where networking technologies are being deployed, and its standards output reflect was is considered by the technical community as feasible and good practice.  Because mediates many aspects of modern life, and therefore contributes to the ordering of societies and communities, the consideration of the politics and (potential) impact of protocols should be part of the standardization and development process.</t></abstract>
