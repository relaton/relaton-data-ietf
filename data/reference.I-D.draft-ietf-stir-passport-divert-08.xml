<abstract><t>PASSporT is specified in RFC 8225 to convey cryptographically-signed information about the people involved in personal communications. This document extends PASSporT to include an indication that a call has been diverted from its original destination to a new one.  This information can greatly improve the decisions made by verification services in call forwarding scenarios.  Also specified here is an encapsulation mechanism for nesting a PASSporT within another PASSporT that assists relying parties in some diversion scenarios.</t></abstract>
