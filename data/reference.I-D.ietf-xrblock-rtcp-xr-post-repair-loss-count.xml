<abstract><t>This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block that allows reporting of post-repair loss count metric for a range of RTP applications. In addition, another metric, repaired loss count, is also introduced in this report block for calculating the pre-repair loss count when needed so that the RTP sender or a third-party entity is able to evaluate the effectiveness of the repair methods used by the system.</t></abstract>
