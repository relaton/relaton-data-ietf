<abstract><t>Over its thirty-five year history Internet Mail has undergone significant changes in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service. The first standardized architecture for networked email specified little more than a simple split between the user world and the transmission world. Core aspects of the service, such as the styles of mailbox address and basic message format, have remained remarkably constant. However today's Internet Mail is marked by many independent operators, many different components for providing users service and many others for performing message transfer. Public discussion of the architecture has not kept pace with the real-world technical and operational refinements. This document offers an enhanced Internet Mail architecture that targets description of the existing service.</t></abstract>
