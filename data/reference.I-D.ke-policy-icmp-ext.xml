<abstract><t>ping/traceroute and other network diagnostic tools are widely used in the IP networks to diagnose the network reachability, IP packet routing and routing failure location. However, the existing ping/traceroute tools are adaptable only to the pure networks where the routing is based on destination address. When an IP packet passes a certain equipment based on ACL policy routing, the ping/traceroute packet routing MAY be different from the real traffic flow routing. This will lead to an erroneous diagnostic result.</t></abstract>
