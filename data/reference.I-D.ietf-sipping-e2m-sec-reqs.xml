<abstract><t>A SIP User Agent (UA) does not always trust all intermediaries in its request path to inspect its message bodies and/or headers contained in its message. The UA might want to protect the message bodies and/ or headers from intermediaries except those that provide services based on its content. This situation requires a mechanism called 'end-to-middle security' to secure information passed between the UA and intermediaries, which does not interfere with end-to-end security. This document defines a set of requirements for a mechanism to achieve end-to-middle security.</t></abstract>
