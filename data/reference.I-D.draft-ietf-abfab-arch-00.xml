<abstract><t>Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in the space of federated access management.  Most of this effort has focused on two use-cases: network and web-based access.  However, the solutions to these use-cases that have been proposed and deployed tend to have few common building blocks in common.  This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to the commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non- federated access management, including RADIUS, Diameter, GSS, GS2, EAP and SAML.  The architecture addresses the problem of federated access management to primarily non-web-based services, in a manner that will scale to large numbers of identity providers, relying parties, and federations.</t></abstract>
