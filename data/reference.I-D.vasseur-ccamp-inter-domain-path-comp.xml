<abstract><t>This document specifies two path computation methods for computing inter-domain Traffic Engineering (TE) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Label Switched (LSP) paths. In this document a domain is referred to as a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems. The first path computation method is also called per-domain path computation whereby each entry boundary LSR is responsible for computing the path to the next exit boundary LSR (where for instance a boundary LSR is either an ARB or an ASBR) whereas in the second method a Path Computation Element (PCE)is used to compute an end to end partial or complete path across multiple domains.</t></abstract>
