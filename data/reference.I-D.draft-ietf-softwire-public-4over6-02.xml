<abstract><t>When the service provider networks are upgraded to IPv6, IPv4 connectivity will still be demanded by network users, at least in the recent future.  This draft proposes a mechanism for end hosts or networks in IPv6 access networks to build bidirectional IPv4 communication with the IPv4 Internet.  The mechanism follows the softwire hub and spoke model, and uses IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel as basic method to traverse IPv6 network.  The bi-directionality of end-to-end communication is achieved by allocating public IPv4 addresses to end hosts/networks, with no dependency on IPv6 addressing.</t></abstract>
