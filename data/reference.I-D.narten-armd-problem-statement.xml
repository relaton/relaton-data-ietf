<abstract><t>This document examines problems related to the massive scaling of data centers.  Our initial scope is relatively narrow.  Specifically, we focus on address resolution (ARP and ND) within a single L2 broadcast domain, in which all nodes are within the same physical data center.  From an IP perspective, the entire L2 network comprises one IP subnet or IPv6 "link".  Data centers in which a single L2 network spans multiple geographic locations are out-of-scope.</t></abstract>
