<abstract><t>This document defines extended electronic signature policies (ext-SP) that extend the boundaries of the electronic signature policy defined in [RFC3125] in a manner that the relationships and dependences among multiple electronic signatures generated within the scope of the same electronic transaction can be established. A given legal/contractual context may recognize a particular ext-SP as meeting its requirements.  An ext-SP has a globally unique reference, which is bound to an electronic signature by the signer as part of the signature calculation.  The ext-SP can be defined in human readable form so that it can be assessed to meet the requirements of the legal and contractual context in which it is being applied.  To allow for the automatic processing, the ext-SP specifies, using a computer processable form, the timing and sequence dependencies of the set of signatures that must be generated to make the transaction effective along with the set of attributes and rules that each signature must comply with.  In the current document the format of the ext-SP is defined using ASN.1.
