<abstract><t>Recent revisions of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 have introduced new features for Optical Transport Networks (OTN) ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODUflex. Several recent documents have proposed ways to modify GMPLS signaling protocols to support the new OTN features.  It is important that a single solution is developed for use in GMPLS signaling and routing protocols. This solution must address all of  zhang  Expires January 2010  [page 1]  draft-zhang-ccamp-gmpls-evolving-g709-00.txt  July 2009  the new features, must be acceptable to all equipment vendors, and must be extensible for the evolving OTN.  This document describes the extensions to the Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling to control the evolving Optical Transport Networks (OTN) with new features including ODU0, ODU4, ODU2e, ODU3e1, ODU3e2 and ODUflex.</t></abstract>
