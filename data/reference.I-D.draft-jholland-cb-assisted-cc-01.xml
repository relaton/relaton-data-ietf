<abstract><t>This document specifies Circuit Breaker Assisted Congestion Control (CBACC), which provides bandwidth information from senders to intermediate network nodes to enable good decisions for fast-trip Network Transport Circuit Breaker activity ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-circuit-breaker]) when necessary for network health. CBACC is specifically designed to support protocols using IP multicast, particularly as a supplement to receiver-driven congestion control protocols to help affected networks rapidly detect and mitigate the impact of scenarios in which a network is oversubscribed to flows which are not responsive to congestion.</t></abstract>
