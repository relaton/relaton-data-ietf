<abstract><t>Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the ability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss and one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as delay variation and channel throughput.  This measurement capability also provides operators with greater visibility into the performance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting, and network performance evaluation.  This document specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of these performance metrics in MPLS networks.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
