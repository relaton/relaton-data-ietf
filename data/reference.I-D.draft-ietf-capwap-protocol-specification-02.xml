<abstract><t>Wireless LAN product architectures have evolved from single autonomous access points to systems consisting of a centralized controller and Wireless Termination Points (WTPs). The general goal of centralized control architectures is to move access control, including user authentication and authorization, mobility management This specification defines the Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Protocol. The CAPWAP protocol meets the IETF CAPWAP working group protocol requirements. The CAPWAP protocol is designed to be flexible, allowing it to be used for a variety of wireless technologies. This document describes the base CAPWAP protocol, including an extension which supports the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN protocol. Future extensions will enable support of additional wireless technologies.</t></abstract>
