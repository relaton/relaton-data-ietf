<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 [1] defines two different modes to handle the mobility problem (i.e., mobile node moving accross different networks and changing its IP address). The two modes had been mainly designed for scenarios involving one mobile node and one static node (correspondent node). This document answers issues related to scenarios involving two mobile nodes (i.e., the correspodent node is also a mobile node). The document addresses also the double jumping problem where two mobile nodes move at the same time (i.e., switch to new subnets). The document proposes a new mode called 'BUB' (Binding Update Backhauling) allowing a more secure, reliable and optimized exchange of Binding Updates (BUs) between two mobile endpoints.</t></abstract>
