<abstract><t>BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC5575) describes the distribution of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) which are distributed via BGP to BGP peers.  Three applications utilize this traffic filter policy: (1) mitigation of Denial of Service (DoS), (2) enabling of traffic filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNS, and (3)centralized traffic control for networks with SDN or NFV controllers. Application of centralized traffic utilizing BGP Flow Specification traffic filters may need user-ordered filters rather than RFC5575's strict ordering of filters and defined ordering of actions.  This document proposes a new BGP Flow specification version 2 that supports user-order of filters and actions plus allowing more actions</t></abstract>
