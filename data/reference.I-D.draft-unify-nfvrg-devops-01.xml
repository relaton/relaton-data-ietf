<abstract><t>The introduction of virtualization technologies, starting from the physical layer and going all the way up to the application plane, is transforming the telecom network infrastructure onto an agile, model- driven production environment for communication services. Carrier- grade network management was optimized for environments built with monolithic physical nodes and involves significant deployment, integration and maintenance efforts from network service providers. The DevOps movement in the data center is a source of inspiration regarding how to simplify and automate management processes for software-defined infrastructure. This first version of this draft identifies three areas that we consider key to applying DevOps principles in a telecom service provider environment, namely for monitoring, verification and troubleshooting processes. Finally, we introduce challenges associated with operationalizing DevOps principles at scale in software-defined telecom networks.</t></abstract>
