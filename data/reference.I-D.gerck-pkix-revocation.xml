<abstract><t>PKIX certificate revocation protocols are primarily described in RFC3280. This Document revisits limitations on determining the revocation status of a certificate. Ambiguous aspects of revocation and revocation delegation are resolved. An objective point of view is introduced as a reference that does not depend on the observer (e.g., the RP). The revocation status of a certificate issued by a conforming CA is shown to be always well-defined from a relying party's point of view -- i.e., it is unambiguous (revoked or not revoked) and ultimately determinable at any period in time. The limitations on determining the revocation status of a certificate have nothing to do with the eventual result of the determination process by a relying party. The limitations have to do with the efforts for that determination, which may require a large (actually unspecified) amount of time and work. Some practices are also suggested, allowing a relying party to determine the revocation status of a certificate with higher reliability in less time. The same considerations apply to determinations of status "change" processes, including certificateHold and removefromCRL.</t></abstract>
