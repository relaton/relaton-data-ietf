<abstract><t>This RFC focuses discussion on the particular problems in the    ARPA-Internet of low speed network interconnection with personal    computers, and possible methods of solution.  None of the proposed    solutions in this document are intended as standards for the    ARPA-Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge    as to the appropriate solution to the problems, leading eventually to    the adoption of standards.</t></abstract>
