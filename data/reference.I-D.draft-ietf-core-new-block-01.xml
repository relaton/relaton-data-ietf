<abstract><t>This document specifies alternate Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Block-Wise transfer options: Quick-Block1 and Quick-Block2 Options.  These options are similar to the CoAP Block1 and Block2 Options, not a replacement for them, but do enable faster transmission rates for large amounts of data with less packet interchanges as well as supporting faster recovery should any of the blocks get lost in transmission.</t></abstract>
