<abstract><t>This document describes the requirements and challenges to employ artificial intelligence (AI) into the constraint Internet of Things (IoT) service environment for embedding intelligence and increasing efficiency.  The IoT service environment includes heterogeneous and multiple IoT devices and systems that work together in a cooperative and intelligent way to manage homes, buildings, and complex autonomous systems. Therefore, it is becoming very essential to integrate IoT and AI technologies to increase the synergy between them. However, there are several limitations to achieve AI enabled IoT as the availability of IoT devices is not always high, and IoT networks cannot guarantee a certain level of performance in real-time applications due to resource constraints.  This document intends to present a right direction to empower AI in IoT for learning and analyzing the usage behaviors of IoT devices/systems and human behaviors based on previous records and experiences. With AI enabled IoT, the IoT service environment can be intelligently managed in order to compensate for the unexpected performance degradation often caused by abnormal situations.</t></abstract>
