<abstract><t>Interative Connectivity Establishment (ICE) has been specified as a NAT traversal mechanism for protocols based on the offer/answer exchange model.  In practice, only the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been based on the offer/answer model.  This document defines a SIP independent subset of ICE, called NICE, which can be used with any protocol wishing to establish a direct host-to-host relationship through NAT.  Protocol specifications need only reference this document, and include the object defined here in their messages, in order to achieve NAT traversal.</t></abstract>
