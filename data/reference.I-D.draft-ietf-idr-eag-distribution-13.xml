<abstract><t>Administrative groups are link attributes (commonly referred to as "colors" or "link colors") advertised by link state protocols (e.g. ISIS or OSPF) and used for traffic engineering.  These administrative groups were initially defined as 32 bit masks.  As network usage grew, these 32 bit masks were found to constrain traffic engineering. Therefore, link state protocols (ISIS, OSPF) were expanded to advertise a variable length administrative group.</t></abstract>
