<abstract><t>This draft presents extensions to Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to enable RESTful Real-time Live Streaming for improving the Quality of Experience (QoE) for delay-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The overall architecture is termed "Adaptive RESTful Real-time Live Streaming for Things (A-REaLiST)". It is particularly designed for applications which rely on real-time augmented vision through live First Person View (FPV) feed from constrained remote agents like Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), etc. These extensions provide the necessary hooks to help solution designers ensure low-latency transfer of streams and, for contents like video, a quick recovery from freeze and corruption without incurring undue lag. A-REaLiST is an attempt to provide an integrated approach to maintain the balance amongst QoE, resource- efficiency and loss resilience. It provides the necessary hooks to optimize system performance by leveraging contextual intelligence inferred from instantaneous information segments in flight. These extensions equip CoAP with a standard for efficient RESTful streaming for Internet of Things (IoT) contrary to HTTP-streaming in conventional Internet.</t></abstract>
