<abstract><t>Simple Traversal of UDP Through NATs (STUN) is a lightweight protocol that provides the ability for applications to determine the public IP addresses and ports allocated to them by the NAT and to keep NAT bindings open. These addresses and ports can be placed into protocol payloads where a client needs to provide a publically routable IP address. STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them. As a result, it allows a wide variety of applications to work through existing NAT infrastructure.</t></abstract>
