<abstract><t>RFC 5378, "Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust", has been interpreted in a way that is unworkable in practice for updates to documents created before it came into effect, and for other documents that derive significant amounts of text from such earlier documents. It requires, as a condition of Internet Draft posting or RFC publication or even as a condition of posting of Internet Drafts, that authors or editors obtain rights from people who may be unavailable or uncooperative.  This specification modifies the RFC 5378 rules to permit the IETF to continue to do work in an orderly fashion when documents containing earlier text are involved and permission is not easily obtained.</t></abstract>
