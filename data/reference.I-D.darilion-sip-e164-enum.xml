<abstract><t>To determine which domain is allowed to claim ownership of a certain telephone number is difficult.  This may cause problems when to authenticate endpoints that use telephone number URIs and domain names in their From address.  This document investigates a proposal that stores a public key below the corresponding ENUM tree in the DNS.  The verifier can determine ownership by performing an ENUM lookup to retrieve the public key from the DNS and to use it for verifying the signature created as part of the SIP Identity mechanism.  This document is a contribution to the ongoing discussion on RFC 4474 when used in combination with E.164 numbers.</t></abstract>
