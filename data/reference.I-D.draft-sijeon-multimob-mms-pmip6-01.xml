<abstract><t>To support IP-based group communication such as mobile IPTV in mobile environment, IP multicasting is required. For minimized burden and modification on PMIPv6 components, multicasting architecture is required to determine where to locate the multicast router (MR) and how to operate IGMP/MLD action in PMIPv6 network. To deploy PMIPv6 multicasting, there are two possible approaches: tunnel forwarding and direct routing scenario. But, this draft focuses direct routing scenario based PMIPv6 multicasting architecture that do not require MR function within the LMA and handover mechanism and describes IGMP/MLD operation. Our solution is easy to deploy and save bandwidth usage. And it solves the tunnel convergence problem without PMIPv6 modification.</t></abstract>
