<abstract><t>This document describes the ChaMeLeon (CML) routing protocol designed for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) supporting emergency communications. CML is a hybrid and adaptive routing protocol operating within a defined disaster area denoted as the Critical Area (CA). The main concept behind CML is the adaptability of its routing mechanisms towards changes in the physical and logical state of a MANET. For autonomous emergency communications, there is a likelihood that the network size will vary whenever more rescuers join or leave the network. In addition, battery exhaustion of lightweight mobile communication devices used by rescuers could stipulate another reason for changes in the network size. Hence, this version of CML adapts its routing behavior according to changes in the network size within a pre-defined CA. For small networks, CML routes data proactively using the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol whereas for larger networks it utilizes the reactive Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing protocol so that overall routing performance is improved. These transitions occur via the CML oscillation phase. This document focuses on the description of the processes involved in the CML Adaptive module, CML Oscillation phase and transition between phases.</t></abstract>
