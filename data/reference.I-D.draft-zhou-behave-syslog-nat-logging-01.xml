<abstract><t>Under some circumstances operators will need to maintain a dynamic record of external address and port assignments made by a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN), and will find it feasible and convenient to create such records using SYSLOG (RFC 5424).  The present document standardizes a SYSLOG format to meet that recording requirement.  It specifies a number of fields that could be a part of the log report, leaving it up to operators to select the fields needed for their specific circumstances.  [*** Subject to discussion*** The log format presented here may also be used by PCP server implementations to log the mappings they implement.]</t></abstract>
