<abstract><t>It has often been the case that manageability considerations have been retrofitted to protocols after they have been specified, standardized, implemented, or deployed. This is sub-optimal.  Similarly, new protocols or protocol extensions are frequently designed without due consideration of manageability requirements.  This document specifies the recommendation for all new Internet-Drafts in the PCE Working Group to include a "Manageability Considerations" section, and gives guidance on what that section should contain.</t></abstract>
