<abstract><t>This specification defines a new SIP response code, 199 Early Dialog Terminated, which a forking proxy can use to indicate upstream that an early dialog has been terminated. The response code can be used by a SIP entity, normally a forking SIP proxy, to indicate that an early dialog has been terminated before the forking proxy sends a final response.</t></abstract>
