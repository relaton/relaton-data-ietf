<title>Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP and dual environments</title>
<author initials='R.W.' surname='Callon' fullname='R.W. Callon'><organization /></author>
<date year='1990' month='December' />
<abstract><t>This memo specifies an integrated routing protocol, based on the OSI Intra-Domain IS-IS Routing Protocol, which may be used as an interior gateway protocol (IGP) to support TCP/IP as well as OSI.  This allows a single routing protocol to be used to support pure IP environments, pure OSI environments, and dual environments.  This specification was developed by the IS-IS working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
