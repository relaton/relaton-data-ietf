<abstract><t>When using Header Compression (HC) schemes in conjunction with IPsec (i.e., [HCOIPSEC]) a mechanism is needed to negotiate both the HC scheme and any associated configuration parameters between end-points prior to operation. Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is a mechanism which can be leveraged to handle these negotiations. This document specifies extensions to Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) that will allow header compression schemes and their associated configuration parameters to be negotiated for IPsec security associations.</t></abstract>
