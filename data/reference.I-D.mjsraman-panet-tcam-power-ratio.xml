<abstract><t>A power saving scheme for switching of TCAM banks of fine granularity is discussed in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This scheme switches of TCAM banks of fine granularity and their corresponding SRAM banks depending on the occupancy of routes and their rewrites within the TCAM of a intelligent router line card (where one or more such TCAM entities along with their SRAM banks may reside) by using an algorithm specified in [ID-TCAM-POWER-EFF]. This takes care of switching off TCAM and SRAM banks within a router's line card and correspondingly saves power when the traffic matrix is not large with respect to the routes the packets lookup where the occupancy of such routes is low in the line card. This is with reference to both single and multi-chassis devices. The algorithm specified therein tends to switch off banks which are not in use. The aim of this draft is to use the device level characteristic in the form of a TCAM Power Ratio and disseminate it as a metric within an area or an Autonomous system (where multiple such areas exist within an AS) to compute power saving paths through the set of routers where the TCAM-POWER-RATIO is low. The TCAM-POWER-RATIO is arrived at by dividing the number of bits in the TCAM banks that are switched off by the Total Available TCAM bank space in bits. This ratio is then subjected to the CSPF algorithm as an additional constraint or the only constraint as the case may be in a link state protocol like OSPF or IS-IS with Traffic Engineering Extensions with available utilization on the links also being a factor. This way those routers that have more TCAM banks switched off are avoided and those with higher power consumption but with available bandwidth are used hence not increasing the total power consumed within the area and hence within the AS. This could be achieved by using a PCE like entity that calculates the power shortest paths using this TCAM-POWER-RATIO.</t></abstract>
