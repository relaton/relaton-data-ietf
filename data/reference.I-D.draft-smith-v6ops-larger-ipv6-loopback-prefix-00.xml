<abstract><t>In IPv4, 127/8 is the loopback prefix, where as in IPv6 it is ::1/128.  The significant difference between these two prefixes is the number of addresses they cover; 127/8 covers 2^24 or 16 777 216 addresses, where as ::1/128 covers just a single address.  IPv4's large number of loopback addresses has facilitated some novel uses of the loopback function that cannot be achieved with the single loopback address available in IPv6.  This memo proposes a new larger loopback prefix for IPv6 so that these uses of the loopback function become available for IPv6.</t></abstract>
