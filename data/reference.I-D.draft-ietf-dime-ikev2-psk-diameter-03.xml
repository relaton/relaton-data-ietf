<abstract><t>The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a component of the IPsec architecture and is used to perform mutual authentication as well as to establish and to maintain IPsec security associations (SAs) between the respective parties.  IKEv2 supports several different authentication mechanisms, such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), certificates, and pre-shared secrets.  With [RFC 5778] the Diameter interworking for Mobile IPv6 between the Home Agent, as a Diameter client, and the Diameter server has been specified.  However, that specification focused on the usage of EAP and did not include support for pre-shared secret based authentication available with IKEv2.  This document therefore extends the functionality offered by [RFC 5778] with pre-shared key based authentication offered by IKEv2 when no EAP is used.</t></abstract>
