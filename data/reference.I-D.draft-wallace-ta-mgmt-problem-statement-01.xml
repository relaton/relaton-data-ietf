<abstract><t>This document provides a problem statement for the Trust Anchor Management Birds of a Feather (BOF). Trust anchors are public keys and associated information that are directly trusted by an application or system to validate digital signatures, including signatures covering other public keys. At present, there exists no standard mechanism for distributing and managing trust anchors. This document describes some of the problems associated with the lack of a standard trust anchor management mechanism as well as problems that must be addressed by such a mechanism.</t></abstract>
