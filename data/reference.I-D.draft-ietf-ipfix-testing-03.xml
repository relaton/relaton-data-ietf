<abstract><t>This document presents a list of tests that implementers of IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) compliant Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes should perform on their IPFIX Exporting Process and/or Collecting Process. This document has been created to help implementers test the functionality of their IPFIX Exporting Process and/or Collecting Process. The goal of these tests is to ensure that all important functions are covered by tests and thereby to gain a level of confidence in the Exporting Process and Collecting Process that allows the implementer to perform interoperability or plug tests with other IPFIX Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes.Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t></abstract>
