<abstract><t>This document extends the protocol identifier of SDP so that it could negotiate the use of IKE for media session in SDP offer/answer model. And it also specifies the method to boot up IKE and generate IPsec SA using self-signed certificate under the mechanism of comedia-tls. This document extends RFC 4572.  In addition, it defines a new attribute "udp-setup", which is similar to "setup" attribute defined in RFC 4145, to enable endpoints to negotiate their roles in the IKE session.  Considering the case that pre-shared keys can be used for authentication in IKE, a new attribute "psk-fingerprint" is also defined.</t></abstract>
