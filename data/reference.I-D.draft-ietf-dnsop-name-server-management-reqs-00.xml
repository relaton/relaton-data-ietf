<abstract><t>Management of name servers for the Domain Name Service (DNS) has traditionally been done using vendor-specific monitoring, configuration and control methods.  Although some service monitoring platforms can test the functionality of the DNS itself there is not a interoperable way to manage (monitor, control and configure) the internal aspects of a name server itself.  This document discusses the requirements of a management system for DNS name servers.  A management solution that is designed to manage the DNS can use this document as a shopping list of needed features.</t></abstract>
