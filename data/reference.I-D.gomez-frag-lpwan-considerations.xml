<abstract><t>The SCHC adaptation layer provides header compression and fragmentation functionality between IPv6 and an underlying LPWAN technology.  SCHC fragmentation has been specifically designed for the characteristics of LPWANs.  However, when CoAP is used at the application layer, there exists an alternative approach for fragmentation, which is using the CoAP Block option.  This document aims at illustrating the advantages and limitations of each approach for transferring larger payloads.</t></abstract>
