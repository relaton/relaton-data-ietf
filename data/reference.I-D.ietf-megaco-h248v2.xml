<abstract><t>This document describes the second version of the general-purpose gateway control protocol standardized as Megaco in the IETF and as Recommendation H.248 (now H.248.1) in the ITU-T. It is common text with Recommendation H.248.1 (05/02), published by the ITU-T. Megaco v2 includes the corrections to RFC 3015 which resulted in RFC xxxx [draft-ietf-megaco-3015corr-02.txt], plus the following new capabilities: - ability to audit specific properties, events, signals and statistics - use of serviceChange to indicate that capabilities have changed in the Media Gateway - playing a signal on the Root Termination - limiting the number of repetitions of transaction pending - allowing topology to be set per stream - ability to audit context properties - new Nx64K multiplex type - provision for digit buffering when a digit map completes. In addition, the use of the Modem Descriptor was deprecated. A detailed list of changes from draft-ietf-megaco-3015corr- 02.txt/H.248.1 (03/02) to this document is given in Appendix II at the end of this document.</t></abstract>
