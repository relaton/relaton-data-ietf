<abstract><t>Over the past few years, the number of RFCs that define and use IPsec and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) has greatly proliferated.  This is complicated by the fact that these RFCs originate from numerous IETF working groups: the original IPsec WG, its various spin-offs, and other WGs that use IPsec and/or IKE to protect their protocols' traffic.</t><t>This document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs.  It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions.  It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous  &quot;IP Security Document Roadmap.&quot;</t><t>The obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents. The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the recommended contents of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication algorithms.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
