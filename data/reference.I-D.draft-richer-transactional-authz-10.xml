<abstract><t>This document defines a mechanism for delegating authorization to a piece of software, and conveying that delegation to the software. This delegation can include access to a set of APIs as well as information passed directly to the software.  This document is input into the GNAP working group and should be referred to as "XYZ" to differentiate it from other proposals.</t></abstract>
