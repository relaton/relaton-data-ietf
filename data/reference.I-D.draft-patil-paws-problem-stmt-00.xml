<abstract><t>Governments around the world continue to search for new pieces of radio spectrum which can be used by the expanding wireless communications industry to provide Broadband Wireless Access (BWA). The concept of allowing secondary or unlicensed transmissions in frequencies occupied by a primary or licensed user is a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use.  An obvious requirement is that these secondary or unlicensed transmissions do not interfere with the primary or licensed use of the spectrum.  The fundamental issue is how to determine for a specific location and specific time if any TV channels are available for unlicensed use, e.g. they are not being used for TV broadcast or by a wireless microphone. Academia and Industry have studied multiple cognitive radio enablers for use in such a scenario.  The methods of geolocation and database have been shown to achieve favorable results.  This document discusses the requirements and the problems that need to be addressed for enabling the use of white-space spectrum by obtaining information from a database.</t></abstract>
