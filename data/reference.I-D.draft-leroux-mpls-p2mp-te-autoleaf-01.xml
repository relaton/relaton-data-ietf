<abstract><t>The setup of a Point To MultiPoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (TE LSP) requires the head-end Label Switching Router (LSR) to be aware of all leaf LSRs. This may require the potentially cumbersome configuration of potentially a large number of leaf LSRs on the P2MP TE LSP head-end LSR. Also leaf LSRs may want to dynamically join or leave a P2MP TE LSP without requiring manual configuration on the head-end LSR. This document specifies IGP routing extensions for ISIS and OSPF so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of leaf LSRs members of a P2MP TE-LSP, also referred to as a P2MP TE Group, in order to automate the creation and modification of such P2MP TE LSP.</t></abstract>
