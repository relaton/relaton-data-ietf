<abstract><t>In-network storage systems store redundancy to compensate for the data loss incurred by hardware failures. To maintain the amount of redundancy, in-network storage systems should regenerate the lost redundancy on a replacement server. This document introduces a practical work of router-supported data regeneration in in-network storage systems. Supporting routers in such systems can help to reduce the traffic incurred during the regeneration and save the regeneration time. This document presents a regeneration process that exploits the bandwidth diversity in the network, and the corresponding protocol for storage servers and supporting routers such that supporting routers can work transparently to support the regeneration process.</t></abstract>
