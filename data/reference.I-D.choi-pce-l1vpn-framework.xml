<abstract><t>When path computation is done in the management systems for Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1 VPNs), it would be important that resource information is synchronized between the management systems and the Provider Edge /Provider (PE/P). This draft looks at such a scenario from the viewpoint of the Path Computation Element Metric Protocol (PCEMP) that acts a generic computation model for path based metrics in large multi-domain or multi-layer networks. This draft shows how PCEMP messages might help preserving the path computational entities in the L1 VPN peer nodes. This draft proposes to show how a L1 VPN framework may be included within the scope of Path Computation Element architectures and is derived primarily from the motivation of per VPN peer service solutions using PCE techniques. PCEMP metrics defining path quality measurement criteria, algorithm complexity and scalability criteria for L1 VPNs is in line with the functional specifications of Generalized Traffic Engineered LSP path computation techniques involving Path Computation Element(s) of the PCE WG Charter.</t></abstract>
