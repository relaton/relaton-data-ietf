<title>OSPF Database Exchange Summary List Optimization</title>

<abstract><t>This document describes a backward-compatible optimization for the Database Exchange process in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  In this optimization, a router does not list a Link State Advertisement (LSA) in Database Description packets sent to a neighbor, if the same or a more recent instance of the LSA was listed in a Database Description packet already received from the neighbor.  This optimization reduces Database Description overhead by about 50% in large networks.  This optimization does not affect synchronization, since it only omits unnecessary information from Database Description packets.  This memo  provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
