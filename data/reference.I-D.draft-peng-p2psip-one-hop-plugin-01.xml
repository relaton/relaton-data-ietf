<abstract><t>This document proposes an implementation of overlay plugin algorithm which is called one hop lookups to provide examples and references for the research of one hop based RELOAD.  With the development of the real time communications, there are high demands for the improvement of routing efficiency.  In the one hop algorithm, each peer maintains complete membership information which can guarantee one hop lookups to improve the routing efficiency.  For the RELOAD, using the one hop lookups algorithm to construct Topology Plugin with the same RELOAD core can have a better support for VoIP applications, and the implementation of one hop lookups algorithm plugin is based on the methods provided by RELAOD.</t></abstract>
