<abstract><t>This document is an analysis of multiple interfaces in a host and description of scenarios of multiple interfaces with the respect of TCP/IP layer.  The current TCP/IP mechanism and networking methods are suitable for a single network interface.  When a host has multiple interfaces, the current TCP/IP mechanism and networking methods cannot directly be used for them.  In this document, we describe some problems for a host which has multiple network interfaces as an aspect of host's operations and some usage scenarios of multiple interfaces in a host.</t></abstract>
