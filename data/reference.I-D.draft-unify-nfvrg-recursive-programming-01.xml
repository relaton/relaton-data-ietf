<abstract><t>The introduction of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in carrier- grade networks promises improved operations in terms of flexibility, efficiency, and manageability.  NFV is an approach to combine network and compute virtualizations together.  However, network and compute resource domains expose different virtualizations and programmable interfaces.  In [I-D.unify-nfvrg-challenges] we argued for a joint compute and network virtualization by looking into different compute abstractions.  In this document we analyze different approaches to orchestrate a service graph with transparent network functions into a commodity data center.  We show that a recursive compute and network joint virtualization and programming has clear advantages compared to other approaches with separated control between compute and network resources.  The discussion of the problems and the proposed solution is generic for any data center use case; however, we use NFV as an example.</t></abstract>
