<abstract><t>In 2000, XCAST (Explicit Multi-Unicast) was first proposed as a protocol intended for small group multicasting. It combined three similar datagram simulcasting protocols that were submitted as earlier Internet Drafts by a number of different research groups. After that, researchers in those groups worked together to further develop, experiment and conduct standardization in IETF as well as in the open source community. This resulted in several implementations of protocol stacks, systems of multi-party video conference and group management, and mechanisms for harmonizing XCAST with ASM and SSM. In addition, an XCAST backbone for various experiments has been launched to operate inter-continentally.  One of the main purposes of this document is to summarize the efforts undertaken by XCAST community as "best current practices" that would then be formally introduced to the IETF/IRTF community. In addition, we raise an issue concerning IANA resource allocation, which prevents us from widely expanding our experimental networks as well as distributing our software. Finally, we request IESG and other experts to check the validity of our proposed protocol and make any suggestions about how IANA can assign appropriate resources accordingly.</t></abstract>
