<abstract><t>This document specifies an architectural framework for the application of Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) in transport networks, by enabling the construction of packet switched equivalents to traditional circuit switched carrier networks.  It describes a common set of protocol functions--the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS- TP)--that supports the operational models and capabilities typical of such networks, including signaled or explicitly provisioned bi- directional connection-oriented paths, protection and restoration mechanisms, comprehensive Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions, and network operation in the absence of a dynamic control plane or IP forwarding support.  Some of these functions exist in existing MPLS specifications, while others require extensions to existing specifications to meet the requirements of the MPLS-TP.</t></abstract>
