<abstract><t>This document discusses the architecture of a successor to BGP4. The problems surrounding inter-domain routing and the BGP protocol have been studied within the IETF, the IRTF and elsewhere, but what's required to actually solve some of these issues hasn't been explored much. That's what this document tries to accomplish.</t></abstract>
