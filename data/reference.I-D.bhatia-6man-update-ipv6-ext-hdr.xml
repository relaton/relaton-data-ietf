<abstract><t>In IPv6, optional internet-layer information is encoded in separate headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the upper-layer header in a packet.  There are a small number of such extension headers, each identified by a distinct Next Header value. However, it presents no backward compatible way for incrementally introducing new IPv6 extension headers inside the network.  Additionally since there is no standard format for extension headers, it becomes impossible for intermediaries that want to deep inspect the packet to parse an incoming packet which carries an extension header that it does not recognize.  This document attempts to standardize the IPv6 extension header format to fix these issues.</t></abstract>
