<abstract><t>The text currently present in section 6.3 from RFC 3280 is dedicated to CRL validation. This text needs to be more detailed to explain exactly how it can made be sure that a CRL is issued by the right entity. In addition, a text dedicated to the characteristics that conforming applications MUST support needs to be provided: the current text covers the most complex case and is too complicated to be easily simplified. Text is proposed to be included in 3280bis and to partially replace section 6.3 .</t></abstract>
