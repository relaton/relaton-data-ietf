<abstract><t>IPv6 Routing header type 3 (termed as RH3) is defined and used in Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) that are typically constrained in resources (limited communication data rate, processing power, energy capacity, memory).  Based on the mechanisms introduced by RH3, this document specifies an new IPv6 Routing Header type that provides encapsulation capability of segments with various lengths and can be applied to more scenarios.</t></abstract>
