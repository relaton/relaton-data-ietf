<abstract><t>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for energy management.  Defined requirements concern monitoring functions as well as control functions.  Covered functions include identification of powered entities, monitoring of their power state, power inlets, power outlets, actual power, consumed energy, and contained batteries.  Further included is control of powered entities' power supply and power state.
