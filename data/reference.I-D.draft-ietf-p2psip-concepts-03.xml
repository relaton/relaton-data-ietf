<abstract><t>This document defines concepts and terminology for the use of the Session Initiation Protocol in a peer-to-peer environment where the traditional proxy-registrar and message routing functions are replaced by a distributed mechanism.  These mechansims may be implemented using a distributed hash table or other distributed data mechanism with similar external properties.  This document includes a high-level view of the functional relationships between the network elements defined herein, a conceptual model of operations, and an outline of the related problems addressed by the P2PSIP working group and the RELOAD protocol ([I-D.ietf-p2psip-base], [I-D.ietf-p2psip-sip]) defined by the working group.</t></abstract>
