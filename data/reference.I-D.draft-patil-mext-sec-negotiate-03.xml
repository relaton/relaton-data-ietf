<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 has relied on IPsec and IKEv2 for securing the signaling and user traffic.  A single security mechanism for Mobile IPv6 does not adequately address various deployment scenarios.  The one-size- fits-all security approach is ill suited for Mobile IPv6, as different deployments have different security requirements.  Multiple alternatives to securing signaling and user traffic have been proposed and are being considered for standardization.  When multiple security protocols coexist for providing security for mobile IPv6 nodes, there is a need to negotiate the choice of security protocol between a mobile node and home agent a priori.  This document proposes a method for negotiating the security protocol to be used between mobile IPv6 nodes.</t></abstract>
