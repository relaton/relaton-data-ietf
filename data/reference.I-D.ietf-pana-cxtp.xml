<abstract><t>The PANA protocol offers a way to authenticate clients in IP based access networks. However, in roaming environments, IP clients might change of gateways and new EAP authentication from scratch may occur. The present document describes a solution based on the Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) to enhance IP handover in mobile environments. Note that only the intra-domain case is considered. This protocol can recover the previously established PANA security context from previous PANA Authentication Agent.</t></abstract>
