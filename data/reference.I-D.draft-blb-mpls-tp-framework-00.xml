<abstract><t>There is a requirement to use MPLS to provide a network layer to support packet transport services. It is desirable that the operation and maintenance of such an MPLS based packet transport network follow operational models typical in optical transport networks, while providing additional OAM, survivability and other maintenance functions not currently supported by MPLS. This draft presents a framework for an architectural and functional profile of MPLS in order to support packet transport services.</t></abstract>
