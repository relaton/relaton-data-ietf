<abstract><t>The MRCPv2 protocol allows client hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers, recognizers, verifiers and identifiers residing in servers on the network.  MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol - it relies on a session management protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish the MRCPv2 control session between the client and the server, and for rendezvous and capability discovery.  It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the MRCPv2 protocol exchange operates over the control session established above, allowing the client to control the media  processing resources on the speech resource server.</t></abstract>
