<abstract><t>In PMIP6-MIP6 interactions scenario C, the HA and LMA are co-located and a transition between MIP6 and PMIP6 is supported without breaking the session.  This draft discusses possible data forwarding behaviours of the co-located HA/LMA in such scenario.  The two recently discussed options are: 1) data forwarding always according to the mobile node's MIP6 BCE, if exists, which means that MIP6 BCE has higher priority than PMIP6 BCE, or 2) data forwarding according to type of the last received mobility management registration message, i.e., PMIP6 and MIP6 BCE have equal priority.  It is argued that option 1) increases handover delay by 1 MN-HA RTT and implementation complexity of the HA/LMA may be higher.  Hence, it is proposed that HA/LMA should behave according to option 2, i.e., MIP6 BCE and PMIP6 BCE have same priority and HA/LMA forwards data according to the type of the last received mobility management registration message.</t></abstract>
