<abstract><t>Services such as content distribution, distributed databases, or inter-data center connectivity place a set of new requirements on the operation of networks.  They need on-demand and application-specific reservation of network connectivity, reliability, and resources (such as bandwidth) in a variety of network applications (such as point-to-point connectivity, network virtualization, or mobile back-haul) and in a range of network technologies from packet (IP/MPLS) down to optical.  An environment that operates to meet these types of requirements is said to have Application-Based Network Operations (ABNO).  ABNO brings together many existing technologies and may be seen as the use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced with a few new elements.</t><t>This document describes an architecture and framework for ABNO, showing how these components fit together.  It provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and meet the needs of the applications.</t></abstract>
