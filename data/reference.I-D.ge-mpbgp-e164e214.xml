<abstract><t>Recently, transferring the signaling of mobile network over IP attracts lots of attention from people.  Telephone number based on E.164 or E.214 or SP is the traditional routing address for mobile network, but actually, E.164, E.214 and SP is not supported by MP-BGP protocol.  This document presents a new way to support for routing the phone number based on E.164, E.214 or SP though MP-BGP, by extending the MP-BGP for the Phone Number Routing.  It can bring optimizing for the network architecture and improving efficiency.</t></abstract>
