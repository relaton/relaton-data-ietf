<abstract><t>This document specifies a special elliptic curve with a compact description (see title) and an efficient endormorphism (complex multiplication by i).  This curve is only recommended for cryptographic use in a strongest-link combination with dissimilar elliptic curves (e.g. NIST P-256, Curve25519, extension-field curves, etc.).  Used in this manner, the curve special features serve as a defense in depth against an unlikely event: a new or secret attack against the other types of elliptic curves.</t></abstract>
