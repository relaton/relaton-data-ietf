<abstract><t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain in a simple, scalable, and robust fashion.  This document defines the two metering and marking behaviours of PCN-nodes.  Threshold-metering and -marking marks all PCN-packets if the rate of PCN-traffic is greater than a configured rate (&quot;PCN-threshold-rate&quot;).  Excess- traffic-metering and -marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the amount marked equals the rate of PCN-traffic in excess of a configured rate (&quot;PCN-excess-rate&quot;).  The level of marking allows PCN-boundary-nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or terminate PCN-flows.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
