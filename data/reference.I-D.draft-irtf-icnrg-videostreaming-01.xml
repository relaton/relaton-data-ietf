<abstract><t>This document presents the usage of Information Centric Networks (ICN) for adaptive multimedia streaming and identifies problems, which have to be considered for such applications. Several important topics related to video distribution over ICN are presented, covering a range of scenarios: DASH over ICN, which leverages the recent ISO/IEC MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard, layered encoding over ICN, PPSP over ICN and IPTV over ICN. DASH over ICN offers the possibility to transfer data from multiple sources as well as over multiple links in parallel, which is definitely an important feature, e.g., for mobile devices offering multiple network links. In addition to this, the named multimedia content is routed and cached efficiently by the underlying network. PPSP extends the P2P semantics to video streaming in ICNs. The real time constraints of IPTV and video- conferencing need to be addressed in ICN.</t></abstract>
