<abstract><t>Over time, Web browsers have adapted how they use HTTP based upon common server configurations and behaviours.  While this is necessary in the common case, it can be detrimental for performance and interoperability.  This document establishes a mechanism whereby origin servers can make available hints for browsers about their preferences and capabilities, without imposing overhead on their interactions or requiring support for them.  This is intended to allow browsers to safely optimise connections to servers.</t></abstract>
