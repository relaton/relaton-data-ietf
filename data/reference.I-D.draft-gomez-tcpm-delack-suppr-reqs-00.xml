<abstract><t>Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) allow reducing protocol overhead in many scenarios.  However, in some cases, Delayed ACKs may significantly degrade network and device performance in terms of link utilization, latency, memory usage and/or energy consumption.  This document presents the problem statement regarding Delayed ACKs suppression.  The document discusses the scenarios and use cases in which Delayed ACKs suppression offers advantages.  Then, requirements for a potential solution are derived.  Finally, a number of potential solutions are discussed, based on the requirements, and also considering pros and cons in each case.</t></abstract>
