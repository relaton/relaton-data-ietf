<abstract><t>This document contains the updates to [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection", in an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection switching requirements.  The following capabilities are required by ITU-T and described in this documents: priority modification, modification of non-revertive behavior, support of Manual Switch to Working (MS-W) command, support of protection against Signal Degrade (SD), and support of Exercise command.  The behavior described in [RFC6378] are modified in order to preserve the network operation behavior to which network operators have become accustomed.  This document introduces capabilities and modes to PSC.  A capability is an individual behavior, and a node's set of capabilities are signalled using the method given in this document.  A mode is a particular combination of capabilities.  This document describes the behavior of the Protection State Coordination (PSC) protocol including priority logic and state machine when all of the aforementioned capabilities are enabled.</t></abstract>
