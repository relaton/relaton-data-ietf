<abstract><t>Network survivability is the ability of a network to restore traffic delivery following disruption or failure or degradation of network resources.  Survivability is critical to the delivery of guaranteed network services such as those subject to strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that place maximum bounds on the length of time the service may be degraded or unavailable.  The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is a packet transport technology based on the MPLS data plane and re-using many aspects of the MPLS management and control planes.  This document provides a framework for the provision of survivability in an MPLS-TP network, describing recovery elements, types, methods and topological considerations.  Survivability may be supported by control plane, management plane, and by Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions to achieve data plane recovery.  This document describes mechanisms for protecting MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  Detailed consideration for the protection of pseudowires in MPLS-TP networks is out of scope.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t></abstract>
