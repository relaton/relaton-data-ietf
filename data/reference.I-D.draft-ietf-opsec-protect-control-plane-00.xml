<abstract><t>This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control plane from undesired or malicious traffic.  In this approach, all legitimate router control plane traffic is identified.  Once legitimate traffic has been identified, a filter is deployed in the router's forwarding plane.  That filter prevents traffic not specifically identified as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane or rate limited to an acceptable level.</t></abstract>
