<abstract><t>The [6rd] mechanism permit IPv6 "rapid deployment" across IPv4 infrastructures of Internet Service Providers, but only in cases where customer-premise equipments can be upgraded to support it. 6rd+ extends this IPv6 rapid deployment capability to hosts behind customer-premise equipments that cannot be upgraded (provided these hosts can be upgraded themselves to support 6rd+).  Like [6rd], 6rd+ provides native IPv6 addresses, so that quality of service can be guaranteed by Internet Service Providers; it operates statelessly, which ensures simplicity and scalability; and it transmits encapsulated IPv6 packets along optimized paths, which contributes to efficiency and acceptability.</t></abstract>
