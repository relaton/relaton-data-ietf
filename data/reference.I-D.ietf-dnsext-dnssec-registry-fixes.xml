<abstract><t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data.  There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms that is incomplete in that it lacks the implementation status of each algorithm.  This document provides an applicability statement on algorithm implementation compliance status for DNSSEC implementations.  This status is to measure compliance to this RFC only.  This document replaces that registry table with a new IANA registry table for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers that lists (or assigns) each algorithm's status based on the current reference.</t></abstract>
