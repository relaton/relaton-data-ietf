<abstract><t>This document specifies an extension to the DOTS signal channel to control the filtering rules when an attack mitigation is active.  Particularly, this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or de- activate filtering rules during a DDoS attack.  The characterization of these filtering rules is supposed to be conveyed by a DOTS client during peace time by means of DOTS data channel.
