<abstract><t>This draft describes an OSPF extension tailored for MANET environments. This extension leverages the techniques that were developed by the IETF MANET working group. Currently no existing OSPF interface type corresponds to MANET characteristics. This proposal therefore defines an extension for an OSPF wireless interface. OSPF specificities over the wireless interface are derived from its broadcast interfaces handling. The new OSPF wireless interface combined with MPR mechanisms from the MANET working group, provides efficient operation of OSPF over MANETs.</t></abstract>
