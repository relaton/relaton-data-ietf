<title>Towards a transport service for transaction processing applications</title>

<abstract><t>The DoD Internet protocol suite includes two alternative transport    service protocols, TCP and UDP, which provide virtual circuit and    datagram service, respectively.  These two protocols represent points in    the space of possible transport service attributes which are quite &quot;far    apart&quot;.  We want to examine an important class of applications, those    which perform what is often called &quot;transaction processing&quot;.  We will    see that the communication needs for these applications fall into the    gap &quot;between&quot; TCP and UDP -- neither protocol is very appropriate.    This RFC is concerned with the possible design of one or more new    protocols for the ARPA-Internet, to support kinds of applications which    are not well supported at present.  The RFC is intended to spur    discussion in the Internet research community towards the development of    new protocols and/or concepts, in order to meet these unmet application    requirements.  It does not represent a standard, nor even a concrete    protocol proposal.</t></abstract>
