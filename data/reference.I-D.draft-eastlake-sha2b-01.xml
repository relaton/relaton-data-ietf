<abstract><t>This document is an update of [RFC4634] to fix errata and to add code for an HMAC-based extract-and-expand key derivation function.  The United States of America has adopted a suite of secure hash algorithms (SHAs), including four beyond SHA-1, as part of a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), specifically SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  The purpose of this document is to make open source code performing the SHA hash functions conveniently available to the Internet community. The sample code supports input strings of arbitrary bit length. Much of the text herein was adapted by the authors from FIPS 180-2.  As with [RFC4634], code to perform SHA based HMACs is included and, new in this version, code for HKDF is included.</t></abstract>
