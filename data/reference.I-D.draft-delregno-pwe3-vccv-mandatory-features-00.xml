<abstract><t>RFC 5085 defines several Control Channel (CC) Types for Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification, none of which are preferred or mandatory.  As a result, independent implementations of different subsets of the three options have resulted in interoperability challenges.  To enable interoperability between implementations, this document defines a subset of control channels that is considered mandatory for VCCV implementation.  This will ensure that VCCV remains the valuable tool it was designed to be in multi-vendor, multi-implementation and multi-carrier networks.</t></abstract>
