<abstract><t>To support IP-based group communication such as mobile IPTV in mobile environment, IP multicasting is required. Two major constraints in mobile multicasting are the tunnel convergence problem and high handover latency. To reduce the constraints, several mobile multicasting schemes based on Mobile IP have been proposed. To provide efficient mobile multicast service related to two problems, we present a multicasting architecture and fast handover scheme for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).</t></abstract>
