<abstract><t>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers for a TCP/IP session, and it could improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure. This document discusses the mechanism of a new network entity, named MPTCP proxy, which is aimed to assist MPTCP capable peer to use MPTCP session in case of one of the peers not being MPTCP capable or to act as an aggregation point for sublfows.</t></abstract>
