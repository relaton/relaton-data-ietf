<abstract><t>6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework which can help manage 6to4 [RFC3056] tunnels operating in an anycast [RFC3068] configuration.  The 6to4-PMT framework is intended to serve as an option to operators to help improve the experience of 6to4 operation when conditions of the network may provide sub-optimal performance or break normal 6to4 operation. 6to4-PMT provides a stable provider prefix and forwarding environment by utilizing existing 6to4 Relays with an added function of IPv6 Prefix Translation.  This operation may be particularly important in NAT444 infrastructures where a customer endpoint may be assigned a non- RFC1918 address thus breaking the return path for anycast [RFC3068] based 6to4 operation.</t></abstract>
