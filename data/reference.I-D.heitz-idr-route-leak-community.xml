<abstract><t>In general, BGP autonomous system (AS) relationships are either customer-transit or peer-peer.  If an AS sends a route received from a transit or a peer to another transit or to another peer, it is considered a route leak.  AS relationships are sometimes different for different routes or in different regions.  A method of detecting route leaks is proposed that does not require participation by the leaking AS or by IXPs.  Only the ASes that perform leak detection need to adopt the proposal.  ASes that request leak protection need to send a community to make the request.  The proposal works even if the leaking AS or other ASes modify or discard path attributes in the route or create more specific routes.</t></abstract>
