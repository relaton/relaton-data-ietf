<abstract><t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol and is able to manage the mobility of an IP host as it moves across different points of attachment within the mobility domain. The IP host whose mobility is being managed by the network is unaware of the existence of Proxy Mobile IPv6 in the network or mobility being managed on its behalf. This draft proposes mechanisms by which the host is informed of proxy mobile IPv6 support in a network that it attaches to as well as the ability for the host to discover such capability in the attached network. The ability of the host to discover or be aware of proxy mobile IPv6 support in the network enables better decision making in terms of the type of mobility protocol used for IP mobility.</t></abstract>
