<abstract><t>A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path (LSPs), reserved resources within the network, and pending path computation requests. This information may then be considered when computing new traffic engineered LSPs, and for associated and dependent LSPs, received from Path Computation Clients (PCCs). The Path computation response from a PCE is helpful for the PCC to gracefully establish the computed LSP.  The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture, provides an architecture to allow the optimum sequence of inter-connected domains to be selected, and network policy to be applied if applicable, via the use of a hierarchical relationship between PCEs.  Combining the capabilities of Stateful PCE and the Hierarchical PCE would be advantageous. This document describes general considerations and use cases for the deployment of Stateful, and not Stateless, PCEs using the Hierarchical PCE architecture.</t></abstract>
