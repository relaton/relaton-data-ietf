<abstract><t>This document introduces a simple and yet time-proven strategy for handling long lines in inclusions in drafts using a backslash ('\') character where line-folding has occurred.  The strategy works on any text-based content, but is primarily intended for a structured sequence of lines, such as would be referenced by the &lt;sourcecode> element defined in Section 2.48 of RFC 7991, rather than for two- dimensional imagery, such as would be referenced by the &lt;artwork> element defined in Section 2.5 of RFC 7991.  The approach produces consistent results, regardless of the content, that is both self- documenting and enables automated reconstitution of the original content.</t></abstract>
