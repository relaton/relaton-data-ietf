<abstract><t>This document specifies a set of necessary functions and desirable properties of an ideal system for resolving names to addresses and associated information for establishing communication associations in the Internet.  For each property, it briefly explains the rationale behind it, and how the property is or could be met with the present Domain Name System.  It is intended to start a discussion within the IAB's Names and Identifiers program about gaps between the present reality of DNS and the naming service the Internet needs by returning to first principles.</t></abstract>
