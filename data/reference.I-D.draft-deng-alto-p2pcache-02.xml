<abstract><t>Uploading from peers located in a public WLAN hotspot has been reported to severely impact other current users' experiences, and raised caution from the operator's side who are willing to increasingly participate in building public WLAN facilities to offload the explosive mobile data traffic from cellular networks. Cooperation between the network operator and the P2P service providers in form of intra-domain P2P caches is expected to be an effective mechanism to solve the problem.  This draft introduces considerations on ALTO deployment in terms of P2P caches and discusses potential extensions to the ALTO protocol to standardize this mutual cooperation.</t></abstract>
