<abstract><t>This memo describes a methodology for measuring TCP throughput performance in an end-end managed network environment.  This memo is intended to provide a practical approach to help users validate the TCP layer performance of a managed network, which should provide a better indication of end-user application level experience.  In the methodology, various TCP and network parameters are identified that should be tested as part of the network verification at the TCP layer.</t></abstract>
