<abstract><t>This document specifies a new URI scheme called http+srv which uses a DNS SRV lookup to locate a HTTP server.  The http+srv scheme operates in the same way as an http scheme but instead of the normal DNS lookup that a http scheme would use, it first tries an DNS SRV lookup.  This memo also defines a https+srv scheme that operates in the same was as an https URI but uses DNS SRV lookups.  The draft is being discussed on the apps-discuss@ietf.org list.</t></abstract>
