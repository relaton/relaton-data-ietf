<abstract><t>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol designed for TCP/IP internets.  Typically, all BGP speakers within a single AS must be fully meshed so that any external routing information must be re-distributed to all other routers within that Autonomous System (AS).  This represents a serious scaling problem that has been well documented with several alternatives proposed.</t><t>This document describes the use and design of a method known as &quot;route reflection&quot; to alleviate the need for &quot;full mesh&quot; Internal BGP (IBGP).</t><t>This document obsoletes RFC 2796 and RFC 1966.
