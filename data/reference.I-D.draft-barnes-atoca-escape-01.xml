<abstract><t>Recipients of emergency alerts need to be able to verify that an alert they receive was issued by an authorized source.  The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) provides a standard way of encoding alert information, but does not provide any security features that would support authentication of alert originators.  This document describes a security wrapper for Common Alerting Protocol objects to allow alerts to be signed by alert originators.  Please send feedback to the atoca@ietf.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
