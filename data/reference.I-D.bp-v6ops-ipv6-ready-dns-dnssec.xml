<abstract><t>This document defines the timing for implementing a worldwide IPv6-Ready DNS and DNSSEC infrastructure, in order to facilitate the global IPv6-only deployment.  A key issue for this, is the need for a global support of DNSSEC and DNS64, which in some scenarios do not work well together.  This document states that any DNSSEC signed resources records should include a native IPv6 resource record as the most complete and expedient path to solve any deployment conflict with DNS64 and DNSSEC</t></abstract>
