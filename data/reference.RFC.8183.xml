<title>An Out-of-Band Setup Protocol for Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Production Services</title>
<author initials='R.' surname='Austein' fullname='R. Austein'><organization /></author>

<abstract><t>This note describes a simple out-of-band protocol to ease setup of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) provisioning and publication protocols between two parties.  The protocol is encoded in a small number of XML messages, which can be passed back and forth by any mutually agreeable means which provides acceptable data integrity and authentication.</t><t>This setup protocol is not part of the provisioning or publication protocol; rather, it is intended to simplify configuration of these protocols by setting up relationships and exchanging keying material used to authenticate those relationships.</t></abstract>
