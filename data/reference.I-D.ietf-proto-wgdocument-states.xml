<abstract><t>The IETF Datatracker tool needs to be enhanced to make it possible for Working Group (WG) Chairs to provide IETF participants with more information about the status and progression of WG documents than is currently possible.  This document defines new states and status annotation tags that need to be added to the Datatracker to enable WG Chairs and their delegates to track the status of Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) that are associated with their WGs.  This document also describes the meaning of all previously implemented I-D states and substate annotation tags currently used by IETF Area Directors to indicate the status of I-Ds that have been sent to the IESG for evaluation and publication.</t></abstract>
