<abstract><t>This document presents a straightforward address autoconfiguration mechanism for RPL over low power and lossy networks (LLN). A solution is proposed to add the capability of reusable address allocation. In this solution, nodes are assigned with unique IPv6 addresses according to their positions in the network. The amount of routing entries kept at each node is reduced. Also, this document introduces a dynamic adjustment strategy for adapting to uneven distribution of node density.</t></abstract>
