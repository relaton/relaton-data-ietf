<abstract><t>Diversion header is not standardized but widely used to convey diverting information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling. This informational document proposes a way to make interwork call diversion information contained in a Diversion header with a History- Info header or with the Voicemail-URI which are standardized solutions.  In addition, an interworking policy is proposed to manage the headers coexistence. The History-Info header is described in [RFC4244] and the Voicemail URI in [RFC4458]. Since the Diversion header is used in many existing networks implementations for transport of diversion informationand its interworking with standardized solutions is not obvious, an interworking recommendation is needed.</t></abstract>
