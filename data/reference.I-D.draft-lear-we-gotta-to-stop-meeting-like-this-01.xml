<abstract><t>The IETF currently meets three times per year in various parts of the world.  Somewhere around 1,000 people all get into planes, consume carbon, and then attend various meetings in what often is a jetlagged stupor.  We gotta stop meeting like this.  This draft calls on the LLC to research on the community's behalf new modalities for IETF face-to-face meetings.</t></abstract>
