<abstract><t>This document describes how a multi-tenant data centre operator can isolate tenants from network performance degradation due to each other's usage, but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN- style network where anyone can use any amount of any resource.  Zero per-tenant configuration and no implementation change is required on network equipment.  Instead the solution is implemented with a simple change to the hypervisor (or container) on each physical server, beneath the tenant's virtual machines.  These collectively enforce a very simple distributed contract - a single network allowance that each tenant can allocate among their virtual machines.  The solution is simplest and most efficient using layer-3 switches that support explicit congestion notification (ECN) and if the sending operating system supports congestion exposure (ConEx).  Nonetheless, an arrangement is described so that the operator can unilaterally deploy a complete solution while operating systems are being incrementally upgraded to support ConEx.</t></abstract>
