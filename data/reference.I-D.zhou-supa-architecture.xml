<abstract><t>Currently, there are network services that impose specific demands on a communication network. SUPA considers two types of network services, the inter Data Center (DC) communication and Virtual Private Networks (VPN). This document describes the SUPA basic architecture, its elements and interfaces.  The main SUPA architecture entities are the Network Service Agent (NSA) and the Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD). NSA is a functional entity that creates and runs network services/ ABPD is a functional entity, which 1) enables the generation, maintenance and release of i) actual/detailed network topologies and ii) VPN and inter DC service specific abstractions and 2) mapping between the VPN and inter DC service service specific abstractions and the network topology and configuration.</t></abstract>
