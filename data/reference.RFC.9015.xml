<abstract><t>This document describes the use of BGP as a control plane for networks that support service function chaining.  The document introduces a new BGP address family called the &quot;Service Function Chain (SFC) Address Family Identifier / Subsequent Address Family Identifier&quot; (SFC AFI/SAFI) with two Route Types.  One Route Type is originated by a node to advertise that it hosts a particular instance of a specified service function.  This Route Type also provides &quot;instructions&quot; on how to send a packet to the hosting node in a way that indicates that the service function has to be applied to the packet.  The other Route Type is used by a controller to advertise the paths of &quot;chains&quot; of service functions and give a unique designator to each such path so that they can be used in conjunction with the Network Service Header (NSH) defined in RFC 8300.</t><t>This document adopts the service function chaining architecture described in RFC 7665.</t></abstract>
