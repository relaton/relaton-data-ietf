<abstract><t>An architecture is described for content distribution via third-party content distribution networks with reduced privileges.  This architecture allows an origin server to delegate the responsibility for delivery of the payload of an HTTP response to a third party. That party is unable to modify this content.  The content is encrypted, which in some cases will prevent the third party from learning about the content.</t></abstract>
