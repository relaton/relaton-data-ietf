<abstract><t>LISP is a protocol to encapsulate IP packets in order to allow end sites to multihome without injecting routes from one end of the Internet to another.  This memo specifies a database and a method to transport the mapping of EIDs to RLOCs to routers in a reliable, scalable, and secure manner.  Our analysis concludes that transport of of all EID/RLOC mappings scales well to at least 10^8 entries, and that use of DNS or any approach that queries for mappings has substantial operational concerns.</t></abstract>
