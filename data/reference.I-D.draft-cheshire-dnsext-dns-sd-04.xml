<abstract><t>This document describes a convention for naming and structuring DNS resource records. Given a type of service that a client is looking for, and a domain in which the client is looking for that service, this convention allows clients to discover a list of named instances of that desired service, using only standard DNS queries. In short, this is referred to as DNS-based Service Discovery, or DNS-SD.</t></abstract>
