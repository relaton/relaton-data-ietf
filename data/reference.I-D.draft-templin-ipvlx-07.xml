<abstract><t>IPv6 was designed as the next-generation Internet protocol, but global IPv4 deployment continues unabated via private addressing domains behind Network Address Translators (NATs). This document therefore envisions a long-term IPv6/IPv4 coexistence, with IPv6 addresses serving as identifiers (and sometimes also locators) and IPv4 addresses serving as locators (and sometimes also identifiers). This document prescribes a suite of mechanisms and operational practices called: "IPvLX (IP with virtual Link Extension)".</t></abstract>
