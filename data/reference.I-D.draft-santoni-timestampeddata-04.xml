<abstract><t>This document describes a syntax which can be used to bind a generic  document (or any set of data, not necessarily protected by means of  cryptographic techniques) to one or more time-stamp tokens obtained  for that document, where "time-stamp token" has the meaning defined  in RFC 3161. Additional types of temporal evidence are also  supported.
