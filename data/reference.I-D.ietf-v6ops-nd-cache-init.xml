<abstract><t>Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain reachability information.  This document discusses how the neighbor discovery state machine on a first-hop router is causing user-visible connectivity issues when a new (not being seen on the network before) IPv6 address is being used.  The various approaches to mitigate the problem are described, with the proposed solution fully documented in I-D.ietf-6man-grand.</t></abstract>
