<abstract><t>Practice has shown that there are a number of zones all full service resolvers should, unless configured otherwise, automatically serve. RFC4193 already specifies that this should occur for D.F.IP6.ARPA. This document extends the practice to cover the IN-ADDR.ARPA zones for RFC1918 address space and other well known zones with similar usage constraints.</t></abstract>
