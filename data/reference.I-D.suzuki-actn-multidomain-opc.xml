<abstract><t>This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for facilitating dynamic change of an operation plane, which includes multiple virtual networks and/or data transmission paths, from a current operation one to a backup one during a scheduled maintenance or an emergency such as network disaster.  Specifically, the necessity of interfaces between domain management systems to establish consistent end-to-end data transmission paths over multiple domain networks is addressed.</t></abstract>
