<abstract><t>This document describes the requirements for SIP telephony devices, based on the deployment experience of large numbers of SIP phones and PC clients using different implementations in various networks. The objectives of the requirements are a well defined set of interoperability and multi-vendor supported core features, so as to enable similar ease of purchase, installation and operation as found for PCs, PDAs analog feature phones or mobile phones. We present a glossary of the most common settings and some of the more widely used values for some settings.</t></abstract>
