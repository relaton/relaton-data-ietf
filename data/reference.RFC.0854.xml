<abstract><t>This is the specification of the Telnet protocol used for remote    terminal access in the ARPA Internet.  The purpose of the TELNET    Protocol is to provide a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit    byte oriented communications facility.  Its primary goal is to allow    a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and    terminal-oriented processes to each other.  It is envisioned that the    protocol may also be used for terminal-terminal communication    (&quot;linking&quot;) and process-process communication (distributed    computation).   This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet    community.  Hosts on the ARPA Internet are expected to adopt and    implement this standard.  Obsoletes NIC 18639.</t></abstract>
