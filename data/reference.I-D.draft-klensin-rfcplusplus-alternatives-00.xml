<abstract><t>A BoF, identified as RFC++ and focused on possible changes to the identification of a broad range of documents and sources with the term "RFC", has been scheduled for IETF 102 and extensively discussed on an associated mailing list.  At least based on the BoF proposal, the BoF was expected to accept a particular problem description as both adequate and sufficiently important to justify changes and then to consider one particular proposal.  Mailing list discussions have indicated that neither the problem statement nor the proposal are without controversy.  An Internet Draft has been posted that describes that particular proposal in more detail.  Without significant analysis of the problem statement, this draft mentions that proposal as a possible member of a family of similar proposals and then outlines some other families of proposals for the convenience of BoF participants and the community more generally.</t></abstract>
