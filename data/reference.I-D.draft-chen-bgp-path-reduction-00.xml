<abstract><t>In this document we present a mechanism that enhances the "IGP-metric based MED" approach so that load balancing is maintained while limiting the number of BGP alternate paths carried in a network.  The mechanism involves the use of a "scale factor" to scale down the IGP metrics for the purpose of setting MEDs, and is thus termed "scaled IGP-metric based MED".</t></abstract>
