<abstract><t>Real-time media streams that use RTP are, to some degree, resilient against packet losses. Receivers may use the base mechanisms of RTCP to report packet reception statistics and thus allow a sender to adapt its transmission behavior in the mid-term as sole means for feedback and feedback-based error repair (besides a few codec- specific mechanisms). This document defines an extension to the Audio-visual Profile (AVP) that enables receivers to provide, statistically, more immediate feedback to the senders and thus allow for short-term adaptation and efficient feedback-based repair mechanisms to be implemented. This early feedback profile (AVPF) maintains the AVP bandwidth constraints for RTCP and preserves scalability to large groups.</t></abstract>
