<abstract><t>In Mobile IPv6, when a Mobile Node (MN) moves from one Access Router(AR) to another, there is a period during which the MN is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations.  This document specifies a mechanism which enhances Mobile IPv6 protocol signaling to support the creation of a transient binding cache entry in a Home Agent (HA) which is used for buffering downlink packets during this period.</t></abstract>
