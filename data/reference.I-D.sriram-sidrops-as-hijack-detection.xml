<abstract><t>This document proposes a method for detection and mitigation of AS hijacking.  In this mechanism, an AS operator registers a new object in the RPKI called 'ROAs Exist for All Prefixes (REAP)'.  REAP is digitally signed using the AS holder's certificate.  By registering a REAP object, the AS operator is declaring that they have Route Origin Authorization (ROA) coverage for all prefixes originated by their AS. A receiving AS will mark a route as Invalid if the prefix is not covered by any Validated ROA Payload (VRP) and the route origin AS has signed a REAP.  Here Invalid means that the route is determined to be an AS hijack.</t></abstract>
