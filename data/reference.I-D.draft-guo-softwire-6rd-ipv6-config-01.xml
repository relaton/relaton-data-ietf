<abstract><t>This document proposes a new DHCPv4 option containing the addresses of DHCPv6 servers through which the 6rd CPE could obtain the IPv6 addresses of DHCPv6 servers. Thus, the 6rd CPE as a DHCP relay agent could relay DHCP messages from IPv6 hosts which is located in 6rd home networks to one of the known DHCPv6 servers.</t></abstract>
