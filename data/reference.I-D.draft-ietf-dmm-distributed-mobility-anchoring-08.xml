<abstract><t>This document defines distributed mobility anchoring in terms of the different configurations and functions to provide IP mobility support.  A network may be configured with distributed mobility anchoring functions for both network-based or host-based mobility support according to the needs of mobility support.  In the distributed mobility anchoring environment, multiple anchors are available for mid-session switching of an IP prefix anchor.  To start a new flow or to handle a flow not requiring IP session continuity as a mobile node moves to a new network, the flow can be started or re- started using a new IP address configured from the new IP prefix which is anchored to the new network.  The mobility functions and their operations and parameters are general for different configurations.</t></abstract>
