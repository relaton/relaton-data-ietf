<abstract><t>Pervasive Monitoring (PM) attacks on the privacy of Internet users is of serious concern to both the user and the operator communities. RFC7258 discussed the critical need to protect users' privacy when developing IETF specifications and also recognized making networks unmanageable to mitigate PM is not an acceptable outcome; an appropriate balance is needed.  This document discusses current security and network operations and management practices that may be impacted by the shift to increased use of encryption to help guide protocol development in support of manageable and secure networks.</t></abstract>
