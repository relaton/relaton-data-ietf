<abstract><t>Registries on the Internet and the Web fulfill a wide range of tasks, ranging from low-level networking aspects such as packet type identifiers, all the way to application-level protocols and standards.  This document summarizes some of the reasons of why and how to use registries, and how some of them are operated.  It serves as a informative reference for specification writers considering whether to create and manage a registry, allowing them to better understand some of the issues associated with certain design discussions.</t></abstract>
