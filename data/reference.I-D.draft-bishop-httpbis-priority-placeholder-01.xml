<abstract><t>RFC7540 defines HTTP/2, including a method for communicating priorities.  Some implementations have begun using closed streams as placeholders when constructing their priority tree, but this has unbounded state commitments and interacts poorly with HTTP/QUIC. This document proposes an extension to the HTTP/2 priority scheme for both protocols.</t></abstract>
