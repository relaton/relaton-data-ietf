<abstract><t>This document describes procedures that enable a router to populate its Traffic Engineering Database (TED), with local addresses of other routers, that are not advertised in IS-IS TE extensions. The only addresses belonging to a router that are advertised in IS-IS TE LSAs are the router's local addresses on links enabled for TE and the Router ID. The described procedures enable a router to compute traffic engineered MPLS LSPs to a given router's loopback and non-TE capable interface addresses.</t></abstract>
