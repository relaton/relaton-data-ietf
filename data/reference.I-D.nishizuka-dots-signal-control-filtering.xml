<abstract><t>This document specifies an extension to the DOTS signal channel so that DOTS clients can control their filtering rules when an attack mitigation is active.  Particularly, this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or de- activate existing filtering rules during a DDoS attack.  The characterization of these filtering rules is supposed to be conveyed by a DOTS client during an idle time by means of the DOTS data channel protocol.
