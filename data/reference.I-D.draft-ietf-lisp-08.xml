<abstract><t>This draft describes a network-based protocol that enables separation of IP addresses into two new numbering spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs).  No changes are required to either host protocol stacks or to the "core" of the Internet infrastructure.  LISP can be incrementally deployed, without a "flag day", and offers traffic engineering, multi-homing, and mobility benefits even to early adopters, when there are relatively few LISP- capable sites.  Design and development of LISP was largely motivated by the problem statement produced by the October, 2006 IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop.</t></abstract>
