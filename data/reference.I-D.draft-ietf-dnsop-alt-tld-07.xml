<abstract><t>This document reserves a string (ALT) to be used as a TLD label in non-DNS contexts, or for names that have no meaning in a global context.  It also provides advice and guidance to developers developing alternate namespaces.  [Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings, etc.  They will be removed before publication.This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft- wkumari-dnsop-alt-tld.  The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.  NOTE: This document is currently a parked WG document -- as such, all changes are being handled in GitHub and a new version will be posted once unparked.  It had been suggested (off-list) that the draft should contain &lt;TBD> instead of .ALT, and then make the WG choose a string before publication.  A version of the draft like this was published on GitHub (https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-alt-tld/ tree/7988fcf06100f7a17f21e6993b781690b5774472) (and generated no feedback).  This version reverts to .ALT -- the chairs stated that the document was adopted with the string .alt, it has been discussed as .alt.  IMO, it is more readable as .alt; it would also be a difficult consensus call, boiling down to beauty contests.  If the WG selects a different string ("not-dns" had been suggested in the past), the editors will, of course, replace it. ]</t></abstract>
