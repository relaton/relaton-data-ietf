<abstract><t>This document describes the implementation of Apple Inc.'s Back to My Mac (BTMM) service.  BTMM provides network connectivity between devices so that a user can perform file sharing and screen sharing among multiple computers at home, at work, or on the road.  The implementation of BTMM addresses the issues of single sign-on authentication, secure data communication, service discovery, and end-to-end connectivity in the face of Network Address Translators (NATs) and mobility of devices.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational  purposes.</t></abstract>
