<abstract><t>Simple Traversal of UDP Through NATs (STUN) is a lightweight protocol that provides the ability for applications to determine the public IP addresses allocated to them by the NAT. These addresses can be placed into protocol payloads where a client needs to provide a publically routable IP address. STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any special behavior from them. As a result, it allows a wide variety of applications to work through existing NAT infrastructure.</t></abstract>
