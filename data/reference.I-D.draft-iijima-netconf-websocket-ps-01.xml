<abstract><t>This memo proposes transporting NETCONF over WebSocket protocol[I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol].  The use of HTTP and Web-based applications are increasing with the emergence of advanced drawing technologies and cloud computing.  IT management systems supporting browser-based interface are getting common.  It's natural for network management systems to support Web-based interface. Currently, however, few network management protocols support the transportation over HTTP.  Although NETCONF[RFC6241] was defined to be sent over SOAP/HTTPS[RFC4743], it was excluded from the options of realizing notification mechanism[RFC5277] since HTTP lacks bi- directional capabilty.  At present, WebSocket protocol, the update of HTTP with bi-directional capability, is available.  This memo describes the way NETCONF is sent over WebSocket protocol.</t></abstract>
