<abstract><t>The real world use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that any identity that is to be used for authentication has to be configured on the ABFAB-enabled client device.  Achieving this requires software on that device (either built into the operating system or a standalone utility) that will interact with the user, managing their identity information and identity-to-service mappings.  All designers of software to fulfil this role will face the same set of challenges. This document aims to document these challenges with the aim of producing well-thought out UIs with some degree of consistency between implementations.</t></abstract>
