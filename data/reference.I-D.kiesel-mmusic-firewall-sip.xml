<abstract><t>SIP-based multimedia applications dynamically negotiate parameters for the related media streams, such as UDP port numbers.  Therefore, firewalls that want to inspect these streams have to interact with the session signaling.  Several architectures and protocols have been developed for the dynamic control of firewalls on the media path, e. g., MIDCOM, SIMCO, and the NSIS NAT/FW NSLP.  This document investigates problems with the interaction of standard SIP (as of RFC 3261) and these firewall control protocols, especially with respect to error handling.  It will be pointed out how existing SIP extensions can be used for improving the interaction, and which additional mechanisms need to be specified.  While the actual specification of such additional mechanisms is out of the scope of this document, it solicits feedback and discussion.</t></abstract>
