<abstract><t>This draft document will extend the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defined in [RFC5070] to support the reporting of incidents dealing with attacks to physical infrastructure through the utilization of IT means as a vehicle or as a tool.  These systems might also be referred as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Operational Technology Systems, Industrial Control Systems, Automatic Control Systems, or simply Control Systems.  These names are used interchangeably in this document.  In this context, an incident is generally the result of a cybersecurity issue whose main goal is to affect the operation of a CPS.  It is considered that any unauthorized alteration of the operation is always malign.  This extension will provide the capability of embedding structured information, such as identifier- and XML-based information.  In its current state, this document provides important considerations for further work in implementing Cyber-Physical System incident reports, either by utilizing any already existing industry formats (XML- encoded) and/or by utilizing atomic data.  In addition, this document should provide appropriate material for helping making due considerations in making an appropriate decision on how a CPS reporting is done: 1) through a data format extension to the Incident Object Description Exchange Format [RFC5070], 2) forming part of an already existing IODEF-extension for structured cybersecurity information (currently draft draft-ietf-mile-sci-11.txt), or others.  While the format and contents of the present document fit more the earlier option, these can also be incorporated to the later.</t></abstract>
