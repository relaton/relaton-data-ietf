<abstract><t>This Internet Draft provides a detailed description of most of the existing IP autoconfiguration solutions proposed so far.  The main aim of this document is to serve as a general reference for the AUTOCONF solution space.  We present most of the previously proposed IP AUTOCONF mechanisms in MANETs, showing their key characteristics, conforming to the AUTOCONF problem statement draft and the MANET architecture draft.  Furthermore, each solution is analysed based on a number of evaluation considerations.</t></abstract>
