<abstract><t>PCE as a central controller specifies the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and label forwarding entries are downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network devices along the LSP path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible.  Labels downloaded to forwarding entries requires a reliable synchronization mechanism between the path computation clients (PCCs) and the PCE.  The basic mechanism for label database (LABEL-DB synchronization is part of the PCE as a central controller specification.  This document presents motivations for optimizations to the LABEL-DB synchronization and the corresponding PCEP procedures and extensions.</t></abstract>
