<abstract><t>This document describes a simple process that allows authors of Internet-Drafts to record the status of known implementations.  This will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code and potentially reward the documented protocols by treating the documents with implementations preferentially.  The process in this document is offered as an experiment.  Authors of Internet-Drafts are encouraged to consider using the process for their documents, and working groups are invited to think about applying the process to all of their protocol specifications.  The authors of this document intend to collate experiences with this experiment and to report them to the community.</t></abstract>
