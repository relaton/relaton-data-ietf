<abstract><t>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used in networks of all types and sizes for time synchronization of servers, workstations and other networked equipment. As time synchronization is more and more a mission critical service, standardized means for monitoring and management of this subsystem of a networked host are required to allow operators of such a service to setup a monitoring system that is platform- and vendor-independant. This RFC draft provides a standardized collection of data objects for monitoring the NTP service of such a network participant and it is part of the NTP Version 4 standardization effort.</t></abstract>
