<abstract><t>This document describes MIKEY-SAKKE, a method of key exchange designed for use in IMS Media Plane Security, but with potential for wider applicability.  The MIKEY-SAKKE mode uses Identifier-Based Public Key Cryptography (IDPKC) to establish a shared secret value and certificate-less signatures to provide source authentication. MIKEY-SAKKE has a number of desirable features, including simplex transmission, scalability, low-latency call setup, support for Lawful Interception (LI) and support for secure deferred delivery.</t></abstract>
