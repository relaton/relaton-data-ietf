<abstract><t>This is a working document intended to focus discussion and refine draft language for the CoAP protocol specification (or other proposed standards) in the areas of discovery, naming, and addressing. Engineering tradeoffs become more challenging in constrained environments; therefore discovery, naming, and addressing are considered within the context of adjacent topics that may impact or be impacted by design choices in the subject areas.  Special emphasis is placed on group definition and discovery.  Examples show how groups can be represented in CoAP Resource Directories or DNS-SD.</t></abstract>
