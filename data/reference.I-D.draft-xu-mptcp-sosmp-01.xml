<abstract><t>This memo presents a new stochastic optimal scheduler for the Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP). The new scheduler is based on the Lyapunov optimatization technique, which can make online control decision for data scheduling. Considering the payment of users for different paths, this memo makes a trade off between the throughput utility and the cost. The new scheduler can not only satisfy the demand of service, but also minimize the cost as much as possible.</t></abstract>
