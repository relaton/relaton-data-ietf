<abstract><t>This document describes two algorithms, one for source address selection and one for destination address selection.  The algorithms specify default behavior for all Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) implementations.  They do not override choices made by applications or upper-layer protocols, nor do they preclude the development of more advanced mechanisms for address selection.  The two algorithms share a common context, including an optional mechanism for allowing administrators to provide policy that can override the default behavior.  In dual-stack implementations, the destination address selection algorithm can consider both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses -- depending on the available source addresses, the algorithm might prefer IPv6 addresses over IPv4 addresses, or vice versa.</t><t>Default address selection as defined in this specification applies to all IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers.  This document obsoletes RFC 3484.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
