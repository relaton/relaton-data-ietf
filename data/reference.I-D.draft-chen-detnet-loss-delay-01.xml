<abstract><t>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is defined to provide end-to-end bounded latency and extremely low packet loss rates for critical flows.  It's important to measure and monitor the packet loss rates and end-to-end delay and delay variation of a DetNet flow path, which allows evaluation of whether the Service Level Agreements (SLA) of the provided DetNet services are satisfied.  These metrics are also useful in network/traffic planning, trouble shooting, and network performance evaluation.  This document defines protocol mechanisms to support passive Performance Measurement (PM) for DetNet service.</t></abstract>
