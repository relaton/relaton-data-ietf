<abstract><t>This is a position paper.  It documents the author's personal views on how Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities ought to be accommodated in ICN protocols like CCNx or NDN which employ flow-balanced Interest/Data exchanges and hop-by-hop forwarding state as their fundamental machinery.  It argues that such protocols demand a substantially different approach to QoS from that taken in TCP/IP, and proposes specific design patterns to achieve both classification and differentiated QoS treatment on both a flow and aggregate basis. It also considers the effect of caches as a resource in addition to memory, CPU and link bandwidth that should be subject to explicitly un-fair resource allocation.  The proposed methods are intended to operate purely at the network layer, providing the primitives needed to achieve both transport and higher layer QoS objectives.  It explicitly excludes any discussion of Quality of Experience (QoE) which can only be assessed and controlled at the application layer or above.</t></abstract>
