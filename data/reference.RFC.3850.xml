<abstract><t>This document specifies conventions for X.509 certificate usage by Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) agents.  S/MIME provides a method to send and receive secure MIME messages, and certificates are an integral part of S/MIME agent processing.  S/MIME agents validate certificates as described in RFC 3280, the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile.  S/MIME agents must meet the certificate processing requirements in this document as well as those in RFC 3280.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
