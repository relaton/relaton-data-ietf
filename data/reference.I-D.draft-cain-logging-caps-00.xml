<abstract><t>This document lists logging capabilities needed to support the current practices described in Operational Security Current Practices [CURPRAC] and logical enhancements to those practices if the capability existed. Logging is defined as the delivery to another entity or system of messages about the device, the data passing through the device, or the device's interaction with another device. Capabilities are defined without reference to specific technologies. This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies that implement the capability. Each capability cites the practices it supports. Current implementations that support the capability are cited. Special considerations are discussed as appropriate listing operational and resource constraints, limitations of current implementations, trade offs, etc.</t></abstract>
