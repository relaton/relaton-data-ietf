<abstract><t>Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be self-managing, and as independent as possible of configuration.  This document defines an "Autonomic Control Plane", with the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions.  It also serves as a "virtual out of band channel" for OAM communications over a network that is not configured, or mis-configured.</t></abstract>
