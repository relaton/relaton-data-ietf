<abstract><t>This document specifies a syntax for addressing time intervals within time-based Web resources through URI queries and fragments. This scheme is particularly used for Annodex [1] and CMML [2] Web resources, though it could be picked up by any other time-based Web resource format. Temporal addressing enables, e.g., direct access to a clip inside a video stored on a Web Server, or direct jumps to a specific event within a piece of music. The syntax is not restricted to audio or video Web resources though, but covers all kinds of Web resources that contain time-continuous information.</t></abstract>
