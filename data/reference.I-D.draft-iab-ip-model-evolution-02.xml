<abstract><t>This draft attempts to document various aspects of the IP service model and how it has evolved over time.  In particular, it attempts to document the properties of the IP layer as they are seen by upper- layer protocols and applications, and especially properties which were (and at times still are) incorrectly perceived to exist, as well as properties that would cause problems if changed.  Finally, it provides some guidance to protocol designers and implementers.</t></abstract>
