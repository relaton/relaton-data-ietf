<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths by encoding paths as sequences of sub-paths, called "segments". Segment routing architecture can be implemented over IPv6 data plane, called SRv6.  In some use-cases such as end-to-end SR Path Protection and Performance Measurement (PM), SRv6 path need to be identified. This document defines the encoding and processing of Path Segment in SRv6 networks.</t></abstract>
