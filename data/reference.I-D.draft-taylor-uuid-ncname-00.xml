<abstract><t>The Universally Unique Identifier is a suitable standard for, as the name suggests, uniquely identifying entities in a symbol space large enough that the identifiers do not collide.  The literal representation, however, specified in RFC 4122 and elsewhere, cannot be used in conjunction with a number of formal grammars where it would be beneficial to do so.  This document provides the UUID with two additional representations to make these applications possible.</t></abstract>
