<abstract><t>With the development of the Internet, game industry has risen rapidly, from handheld game consoles to PC games and mobile games. The types of games are diversified, while the number of game users is increasing year by year.  The game market is maturing quickly.</t><t> Nowadays, the scale of game users is large and they belong to the easy-to-consume groups.  Among all the games, those require frequent interactions and involve video streaming usually have highly demanding requirements on the network in terms of guaranteed network latency and reliability.  Therefore, from the aspect of ensuring better gaming experience, it is desirable of differentiating the particular gaming application flows and providing high-priority network services for those demanding gamers.</t><t> This document describes the game acceleration scenarios using Application-aware Networking (APN) technology.  In these scenarios, APN can identify the specific requirements of particular gaming applications, steer the flows to the game processors close to the users, and provide SLA guaranteed network services such as low latency and high reliability.</t></abstract>
