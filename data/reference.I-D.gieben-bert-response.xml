<abstract><t>This draft contains a number of loose ends and does not include any text on any (known) corner cases. Its primary goal is to document the choices the DNSEXT working group has on the subject of fixing the NSEC enumeration in DNSSEC. If at any point in time the working group feels this idea needs further work, this draft will be updated. DNSSECbis [RFC LIST] allow for zone enumeration by walking NSEC chains. It also has a large impact on the zone size at the initial deployment stage. This draft proposes a method to address these issues by the use of online signing of negative and wildcard responses.</t></abstract>
