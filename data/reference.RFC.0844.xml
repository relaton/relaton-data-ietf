<title>Who talks ICMP, too? - Survey of 18 February 1983</title>
<author initials='R.' surname='Clements' fullname='R. Clements'><organization /></author>
<date year='1983' month='February' />
<abstract><t>This survey determines how many hosts are able to respond to TELENET    connections from a user at a class C site.  This requires, in    addition to IP and TCP, participation in gateway routing via ICMP and    handling of Class C addresses.  The list of hosts was taken from RFC    843, extracting only those hosts which are listed there as accepting    TELNET connection.  The tests were run on 18-Feb-83.</t></abstract>
