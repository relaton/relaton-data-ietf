<abstract><t>This document consists of two primary components, a schema for agents that make use of the Lightweight Directory Access protocol (LDAP) and a proposed use cause of that schema for distributed configuration of similar directory user agents. A set of attribute types and an objectclass are proposed. A proposal of using attribute and objectclass mapping allows DUAs to re-configure their schema to that of the end user's environment. This document is intended to be a skeleton for future documents that describe configuration of specific DUA services.</t></abstract>
