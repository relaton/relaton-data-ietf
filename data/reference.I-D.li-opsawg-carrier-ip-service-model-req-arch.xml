<abstract><t>Service Model is a fundamental building block for a controller's North-Bound Interface (NBI).  Defining a service model for different multi-layered and heterogeneous networks is a complicated work and may require lots of consideration since different model users may have different perspective and concerns.  This document proposes the requirements and architecture for service models to facilitate future work.  This document does not attempt to provide a detailed description of all the architectural components, but rather it describes a set of building blocks, requirements, architecture and guidelines from which models may be constructed.</t></abstract>
