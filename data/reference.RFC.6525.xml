<abstract><t>Many applications that use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) want the ability to &quot;reset&quot; a stream.  The intention of resetting a stream is to set the numbering sequence of the stream back to 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the application layer that the reset has been performed.  Applications requiring this feature want it so that they can &quot;reuse&quot; streams for different purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the application can track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old stream would result in message numbers greater than expected, unless there is a protocol mechanism to &quot;reset the streams back to zero&quot;.  This document also includes methods for resetting the transmission sequence numbers, adding additional streams, and resetting all stream sequence numbers.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
