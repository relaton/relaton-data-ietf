<abstract><t>On today's Internet, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is often used (some would say abused) to enable asynchronous, &quot;server- initiated&quot; communication from a server to a client as well as communication from a client to a server.  This document describes known issues and best practices related to such &quot;bidirectional HTTP&quot; applications, focusing on the two most common mechanisms: HTTP long polling and HTTP streaming.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational  purposes.</t></abstract>
