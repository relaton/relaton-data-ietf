<abstract><t>Some Internet Service Providers and enterprises desire to be aware of more information about each packet, so that packets can be treated differently and efficiently. Packet-level differentiating can also enable flow-level and user-level differentiating.  IPv6, with a large address space, allows semantics to be embedded into addresses. Routers can easily apply relevant operations accordingly. This document provides analysis on how to form semantic prefix and corresponding use cases, and identifies the technical requirements to maximize the benefits of the semantic prefix approach. It is recommended to use 4~12 bits in prefix for embedded semantics.  This informational document only discusses usage of semantics in a semantic prefix domain. It does NOT intent or suggest to standardize any common global semantics.</t></abstract>
