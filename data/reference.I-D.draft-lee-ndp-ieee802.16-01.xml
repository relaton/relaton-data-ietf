<abstract><t>IEEE 802.16 issued the new standards for PHY and MAC providing broadband wireless access network. Currently, it is being developed under the assumption that IPv4 is used over it and the use of IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 networks has not been considered yet. Hence, this draft describes several problems in running NDP over IEEE 802.16 networks and presents some proposed solutions for those problems.</t></abstract>
