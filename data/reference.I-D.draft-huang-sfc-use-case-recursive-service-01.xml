<abstract><t>Service function chaining (SFC) provides various services that can be tailored to different requirements from diversified user groups, where each user group forms a collective client that requires similar service. SFC is typically deployed as a service overlay with its own service topology on top of existing network topology. This kind of virtualized structure naturally enables recursive service relationship where a client may become a service provider and resell SFC services to its own user groups. Alternatively, a client may also choose to ask its service provider to provide a structured service for its user groups. This document describes some exemplary use cases that show the usage of recursive (e.g. nested) or structured service function chaining relationship.</t></abstract>
