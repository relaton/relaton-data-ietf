<abstract><t>As the increment of network scale and the variety of user request, traditional networks are to be partitioned into multi-layer and multi-domain networks for the purpose of better management.  In multi-layer and multi-domain networks, various user requests are mapped into different LSPs, and the performance of a LSP is of great importance for the users.  Therefore, the LSP is necessary to be evaluated as soon as it is established.  For the purpose of judging whether a LSP establishment meets a user requirement or not, typical performance measurement metrics need to be proposed.  In this document, LSP establishment delay and bit error ratio (BER) which are serving as the typical performance measurement metrics are illustrated, and the definition and methodologies are proposed.</t></abstract>
