<abstract><t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers.  These headers can be used by HTTP servers to store state on HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  The cookie protocol has many historical infelicities and should be avoided for new applications of HTTP.  NOTE: If you have suggestions for improving the draft, please send  email to http-state@ietf.org.  Suggestions with test cases are  especially appreciated.</t></abstract>
