<abstract><t>Static configuration of the MN's (Mobile Node) home address is a very cumbersome task and a provisioning nightmare for the Service Providers. With millions of subscribers, a typical Service Provider stands to incur considerable expenses in order to manually configure all of its MN's home address. The ability to dynamically and securely allocate MN's home address, therefore, can immensely aid in providing a cost-effective and efficient device management alternative to the Service Providers. This draft provides a simple method for dynamically allocating MN's home address in a secure manner.</t></abstract>
