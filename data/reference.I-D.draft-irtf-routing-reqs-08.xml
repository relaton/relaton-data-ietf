<abstract><t>These requirements for routing architectures are the product of two sub-groups with the IRTF Routing Research Group working in 2001 with some editorial updates up to 2006. They represent two individual and separate views of the problem and of what is required to fix the problem. While speaking of requirements, the document is actually a recommendation to anyone who would create a routing architecture for the Internet in the coming years. The document is published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a record of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding that it does not necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the technical consensus of the research group at the date of publication.</t></abstract>
