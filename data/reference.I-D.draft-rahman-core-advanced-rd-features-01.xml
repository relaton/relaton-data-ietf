<abstract><t>The Resource Directory (RD) is a key element for successful deployments of constrained networks.  Similar to the HTTP web search engines (e.g.  Google, Bing), the RD for CoAP should also support useful search query responses beyond a basic listing of relevant links.  This document proposes several new features to be considered for the RD.  The only goal of this document is to trigger discussion in the CoRE WG so that all relevant features for RD evolution are taken into account during CoRE re-charter activities.</t></abstract>
