<abstract><t>Currently TRILL solution can only provide optimum unicast forwarding just for Layer2 traffic of intra-subnet forwarding, not for Layer3 traffic(inter-subnet forwarding). In this document, a TRILL distributed gateway solution is introduced to provide optimum unicast forwarding not just for Layer 2 traffic (intra-subnet forwarding), but also for Layer 3 traffic (inter-subnet forwarding). In the TRILL distributed gateway scenario, an edge RB MUST perform the Layer 2 routing function for the End Systems that are on the same subnet and the IP routing for the End Systems that are on the different subnets of same tenant. ESADI extension can be used for synchronizing &lt;MAC, IP> correspondence among edge RBridges. To reduce the number of ESADI session among edge RBridges, Management Data Label for ESADI is suggested to be used.</t></abstract>
