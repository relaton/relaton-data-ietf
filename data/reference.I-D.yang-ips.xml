<abstract><t>Intrusion prevention systems(IPSs) are a kind of systems that can keep away and interdict intrusions actively. This document puts forward some relevant solutions to the existing problems in IPSs at present. Zero-copy technology is adopted to reduce the system expenses, in order to optimize communication performance; Load balancing technology guarantees the flow distributed at each IPSs engine even; Protocol analysis technology improves detection efficiency to a certain degree. The structure of detection engine designed can be either a node of Large-scale Distributed Intrusion Prevention Systems or an independent IPS.</t></abstract>
