<abstract><t>Information-Centric Networks (ICN) provide substantial flexibility for users to obtain information without regard to the source of the information or its current location.  Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems have gained popularity in society to provide the convenience of removing the temporal dependency of the user having to indicate an interest each time he or she wants to receive a particular piece of related information.  Such an "information-centric" communication model should be supported in the new ICN network paradigm.  This document outlines some research directions for ICN with respect to enhancing the inherently pull-based ICN approaches for achieving efficient pub/sub capability.</t></abstract>
