<abstract><t>In this document, we propose to relax forwarding rule of the Mobile IPv6 home agent. In addition to utilizing link-local scope home address, mobile node may request home agent to bypass specific link- local scope multicast traffic which may be of its interest. The extensions allow mobile node to seamlessly access the home network through link-local communication. Modifications to mobility signals for home registration are made in order to realize the extensions. This document also provides a set of requirements and guidelines for target usage scenario and implications to Mobile IPv6 system design.</t></abstract>
