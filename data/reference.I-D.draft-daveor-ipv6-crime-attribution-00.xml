<abstract><t>The migration from IPv4 to IPv6 is intended to fix a large number of problems with IPv4 that have been identified through many years of global use, not least of which is the shortage of available IPv4 addresses.  One of the challenges with IPv4 that has not, apparently, been adequately considered is the crime attribution characteristics of IPv6 technologies.  The challenge of crime attribution on the Internet is an important one and a careful balance needs to be struck between the needs of law enforcement, the rights of crime victims and the right to privacy of the vast majority of Internet users who have no involvement in any sort of criminality.  The purpose of this document is to consider the crime attribution characteristics of various IPv6 address assignment techniques.</t></abstract>
