<abstract><t>The Quality-of-Experience of a fixed-network user can be significantly improved by enabling the Residential Gateway (RG) providing IP connectivity services to connect to the internet through multiple access networks (Example: LTE and DSL) and use all the available network bandwidth for the user traffic.  This approach enables a service provider to leverage all the availble access networks and to offer guaranteed Quality-of-Service to the end-user on any application basis.  Furthermore, the mobility functions in the residential gateway and in the service provider network will be able to monitor the performance of all the access paths and dynamically change the routing path for an application.  This document investigates the use of IP mobility protocols for supporting this use-case and it also identifies the needed protocol extensions.</t></abstract>
