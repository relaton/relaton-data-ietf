<abstract><t>This document discusses a simplified regular DNS query (resolving from a domain name to IP address(es)) method under IPv4/IPv6 mixed environment.  Under IPv4/IPv6 mixed environment, in order to obtain IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the node with its one domain name argument by the DNS query(ies), it requires for a client to issue two times of DNS queries transaction (one for A(IPv4) record query, the other for AAAA(IPv6) record query). In shortly to say the current DNS query method: "Two DNS queries transaction is required for One domain name resolving."  Two DNS queries transaction method is complicated, inefficient and problematic. It is clear that this two DNS queries method is not suitable and not optimized for current IPv4/IPv6 mixed environment, and this method will never last to the future IPv6 fully deployed environment.  Goals of this document are: 1. to clarify the problems of current regular DNS query method 2. to propose a simplified regular DNS query method ("One DNS query transaction for One domain name resolving")</t></abstract>
