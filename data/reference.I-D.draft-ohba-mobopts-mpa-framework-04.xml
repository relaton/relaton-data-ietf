<abstract><t>This document describes a framework of Media-independent Pre- Authentication (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that addresses the issues on existing mobility management protocols and mobility optimization mechanisms. MPA is a mobile-assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that works over any link-layer and with any mobility management protocol. MPA's pre-authentication, pre- configuration, and proactive handover techniques allow many of the handoff related operations to take place before the mobile has moved to the new network. We describe the details of all the associated techniques and its applicability for different scenarios.</t></abstract>
