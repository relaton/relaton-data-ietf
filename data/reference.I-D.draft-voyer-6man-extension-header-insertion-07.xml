<abstract><t>Traffic traversing an SR domain is encapsulated in an outer IPv6 header for its journey through the SR domain.  To implement transport services strictly within the SR domain, the SR domain may require insertion or removal of an SRH after the outer IPv6 header of the SR domain.  Any segment within the SRH is strictly contained within the SR domain.  The SR domain always preserves the end-to-end integrity of traffic traversing it.  No extension header is manipulated, inserted or removed from an inner transported packet.  The packet leaving the SR domain is exactly the same (except for the hop-limit update) as the packet entering the SR domain.  The SR domain is designed with link MTU sufficiently greater than the MTU at the ingress edge of the SR domain.</t></abstract>
