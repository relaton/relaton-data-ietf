<abstract><t>We would like to dedicate this work to our friend and colleague Dino Bramanti, who passed away at the early age of 38.  Dino has been involved in this work since its beginning.  In a transport network scenario, where Data Plane connections controlled either by GMPLS Control Plane (Soft Permanent Connections - SPC) or by Management System (Permanent Connections - PC) may independently coexist, the ability of transforming an existing PC into a SPC and vice versa - without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being carried over it - is a requirement.  This memo describes an extension to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling that enables the transfer of connection ownership between the Management and the Control Planes.  Such a transfer is referred to as a Handover.  This document defines all Handover related procedures. This includes the handling of failure conditions and subsequent reversion to original state.  A basic premise of the extension is that the handover procedures must never impact an already established Data plane.</t></abstract>
