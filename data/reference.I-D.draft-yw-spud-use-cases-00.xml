<abstract><t>The purpose of SPUD is to provide a standardized layer below the transport layer, to behavior as a communication channel between the host and network devices.  So when a new transport protocol is deployed, it's easy for network devices to cooperate with it.  New transports could have a common encapsulation to middleboxes.  On the other hand, the transport layer could also make use of the state of network devices collected by the SPUD, to improve transport performance.  This document provides some exemplary use cases for SPUD, especially in stateful firewall and TCP optimization.  The objective of this draft is not to cover all conceivable p2a or a2p signaling in detail. Rather, the intention is to explain the requirements in these use cases as far as it is required to complement the problem statement of the SPUD.</t></abstract>
