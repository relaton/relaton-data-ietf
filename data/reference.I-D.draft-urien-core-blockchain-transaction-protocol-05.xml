<abstract><t>The goal of the blockchain transaction protocol for constraint nodes is to enable the generation of blockchain transactions by constraint nodes, according to the following principles: - transactions are triggered by Provisioning-Messages that include the needed blockchain parameters. - binary encoded transactions are returned in Transaction-Messages, which include sensors/actuators data. Constraint nodes, associated with blockchain addresses, compute the transaction signature.</t></abstract>
