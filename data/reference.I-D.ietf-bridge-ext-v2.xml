<abstract><t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets. In particular, it defines two MIB modules for managing the capabilities of MAC bridges defined by the IEEE 802.1D-1998 (TM) MAC Bridges and the IEEE 802.1Q-2003 (TM) Virtual LAN (VLAN) standards for bridging between Local Area Network (LAN) segments. One MIB module defines objects for managing the 'Traffic Classes' and 'Enhanced Multicast Filtering' components of IEEE 802.1D-1998 and P802.1t-2001 (TM). The other MIB module defines objects for managing VLANs, as specified in IEEE 802.1Q-2003, P802.1u (TM) and P802.1v (TM). Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging. Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by subnetworks other than LAN segments. This memo supplements RFC 1493bis, and obsoletes RFC 2674. (NOTE for RFC Ed.: all instances of 'RFC 1493bis' will need to be updated to reflect the new RFC number for draft-ietf-bridge- bridgemib-smiv2-10.txt)</t></abstract>
