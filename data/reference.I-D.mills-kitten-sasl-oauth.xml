<abstract><t>OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to a protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  This document defines how an application client uses OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) or the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) to access a protected resource at a resource serve, and additionally defines authorization and token issuing endpoint discovery.  Thereby, it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-based application protocols.  Clients typically store the user's long term credential.  This does, however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example, when such a credential leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a token. Tokens typically provided limited access rights and can be managed and revoked separately from the user's long-term credential (password).</t></abstract>
