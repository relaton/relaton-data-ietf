<abstract><t>[RFC7432] describes mechanism to elect designated forwarder (DF) at the granularity of (ESI, EVI) which is per VLAN (or per group of VLANs in case of VLAN bundle or VLAN-aware bundle service).  However, the current level of granularity of per-VLAN is not adequate for some applications.[I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election-framework] improves base line DF election by introducing HRW DF election. [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-igmp-mld-proxy] introduces applicability of EVPN to Multicast flows, routes to sync them and a default DF election. This document is an extension to HRW base draft [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-df-election-framework] and further enhances HRW algorithm for the Multicast flows to do DF election at the granularity of (ESI, VLAN, Mcast flow).</t></abstract>
