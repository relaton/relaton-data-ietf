<abstract><t>A zone is a notion which denotes a routing instance, a set interfaces or prefixes characterized by having a different address realm and/or security policy.  A NAT device can route packets with the same source IP address to different zones depending on configuration policies such as destination IP address.  This functionality has been present for many years in NAT devices from multiple vendors.  PCP allows a host to interact with a PCP-controlled NAT device and request an external IP and port.  Therefore a PCP Server that controls the NAT device and receives a PCP request from a host needs to know from which NAT pool to allocate an external IP address and port.  This document specifies an extension to PCP to support the zone concept.</t></abstract>
