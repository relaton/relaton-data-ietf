<abstract><t>SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols and attributes.  This framework has been extended with a Media capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate additional media-related capabilities.

In particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate media titles ("i=" line for each media), connection data ("c=" line), and media bandwidth ("b=" line).</t></abstract>
