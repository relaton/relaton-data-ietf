<abstract><t>The IDNA is a key issue for the IUCG as a paradigm for the future of the Internet. There is therefore a need to make sure its description document set reflects a complete IETF and users consensus. To help this, this memo keeps track of the WG-IDNABIS/LC requested and received answers. The IAB Draft on IDN has been added because some remarks have been made which are important. The author is quoted if the comment is not from IUCG</t></abstract>
