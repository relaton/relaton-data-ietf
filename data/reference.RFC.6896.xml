<abstract><t>This memo defines a generic URI and HTTP-header-friendly envelope for carrying symmetrically encrypted, authenticated, and origin-timestamped tokens.  It also describes one possible usage of such tokens via a simple protocol based on HTTP cookies.</t><t>Secure Cookie Session (SCS) use cases cover a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from distribution of authorized content via HTTP (e.g., with out-of-band signed URIs) to securing browser sessions with diskless embedded devices (e.g., Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) routers) or web servers with high availability or load- balancing requirements that may want to delegate the handling of the application state to clients instead of using shared storage or forced peering.</t></abstract>
