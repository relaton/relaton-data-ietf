<abstract><t>This document describes the raionale and requirements for in-band signalling of Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics for the Internet Protocol (IP) There has been extensive work on QoS for IP, leading to the development of RSVP, NSIS and other protocols. New requirements emerging from the use of IP to carry services such as video and voice are leading in turn to additional requirements for QoS signalling. The authors believe that these can best be met by adding in-band signalling to IP, complementing the existing protocols for QoS signalling.</t></abstract>
