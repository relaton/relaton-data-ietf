<abstract><t>This document specifies "XTLS", a protocol for end-to-end encryption of Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) traffic via an application-level usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS).  XTLS treats the end-to-end exchange of XML stanzas as a virtual transport and uses TLS to secure that transport, thus enabling XMPP entities to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and forgery of XML stanzas.  The protocol can be used for secure end-to-end messaging as well as any others application such as file transfer.</t></abstract>
