<abstract><t>Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC4960] provides a reliable communications channel between two end-hosts in many ways similar to TCP [RFC0793].  With the widespread deployment of Network Address Translators (NAT), specialized code has been added to NAT for TCP that allows multiple hosts to reside behind a NAT and yet use only a single globally unique IPv4 address, even when two hosts (behind the NAT) choose the same port numbers for their connection.  This additional code is sometimes classified as Network Address and Port Translation or NAPT.  To date, specialized code for SCTP has NOT yet been added to most NAT's so that only pure NAT is available.  The end result of this is that only one SCTP capable host can be behind a NAT.  This document describes an SCTP specific variant of NAT which provides similar features of NAPT in the single point and multi-point traversal scenario.</t></abstract>
