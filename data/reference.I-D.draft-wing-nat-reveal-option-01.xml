<abstract><t>When an IP address is shared among several subscribers, it is impossible to determine which subscriber has initiated that TCP connection.  This memo describes a technique to share the identity of a subscriber that initiated a TCP connection with the TCP server. The proposed method avoids altering the application-level payload and works well with SSL-protected connections.  It uses a new TCP option for this purpose.</t></abstract>
