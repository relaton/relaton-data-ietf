<abstract><t>The default method for IPv6 address generation uses two unique manufacturer IDs that are assigned by the IEEE Standards Association [1] (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291) [RFC4291]. This means that a node will always have the same Interface ID (IID) whenever it connects to a new network. Because the node's IP address does not change, the node is vulnerable to privacy related attacks. To address this issue, there are currently two mechanisms in use to randomize the IID, Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The problem with the former approach is the computational cost involved for the IID generation. The problem with the latter approach is that it lacks security. This document offers a new algorithm for use in the generation of the IID while, at the same time, securing the node against some types of attack, such as IP spoofing. These attacks are prevented with the addition of a signature to the Neighbor Discovery messages (NDP).</t></abstract>
