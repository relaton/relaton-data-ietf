<abstract><t>A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed. The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous sites, each being a collection of nodes.  Each site is named by a exterior address whereas each node by a interior local address.  Exterior routing depends solely on site addresses while interior routing on node addresses.  Both interior and exterior routings render inherent mobility as well as seamless multihoming capability.  The model can recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network, enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well as Internet of Things.</t></abstract>
