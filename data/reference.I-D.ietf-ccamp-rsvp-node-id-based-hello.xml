<abstract><t>Use of Node-ID based RSVP Hello messages is implied in a number of cases, e.g., when data and control plan are separated, and when TE links are unnumbered. Nonetheless, this implied behavior is unclear and this document formalizes use of Node-ID based RSVP Hello session in some scenarios. The procedure described in this document applies to both Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) capable nodes. When link level failure detection is performed by some means other than exchanging RSVP Hello messages, use of Node-ID based Hello session is optimal for detecting signaling adjacency failure for Resource reSerVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE). The use of Node-ID based Hello session is optimal in the sense that as long as there is IP reachability to the nieghbor (node-id), the signalling adjacency will remain up.</t></abstract>
