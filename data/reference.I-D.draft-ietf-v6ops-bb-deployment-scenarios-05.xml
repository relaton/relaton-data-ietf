<abstract><t>This document provides detailed description of IPv6 deployment and integration methods and scenarios in today's Service Provider (SP) Broadband (BB) networks in coexistence with deployed IPv4 services. Cable/HFC, BB Ethernet, xDSL and WLAN are the main BB technologies that are currently deployed, and discussed in this document. The emerging Broadband Power Line Communications (PLC/BPL) access technology is also discussed for completeness. In this document we will discuss main components of IPv6 BB networks and their differences from IPv4 BB networks and how IPv6 is deployed and integrated in each of these networks using tunneling mechanisms and native IPv6.</t></abstract>
