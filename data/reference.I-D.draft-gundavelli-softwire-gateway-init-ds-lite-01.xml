<abstract><t>Dual-Stack lite (DS-lite) has been proposed as an IPv4 to IPv6 transition technique.  Dual-stack lite allows a service provider to migrate his network to IPv6, while still offering IPv4 services to the customer.  The dual-stack lite solution uses an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel between a host (or access device) and a dual-stack lite Carrier Grade NAT (CGN).  Several existing network architectures (e.g. 3GPP, WiMAX, or PPP based broadband networks) already specify dual-stack deployment and leverage tunneling schemes between the access device and an access gateway in the provider network. Applying the dual-stack lite concept to these networks will result in changes to the end-system and unnecessary tunneling overhead.  This draft describes a modified implementation of dual-stack lite where existing access tunnels are extended beyond the access gateway to the dual-stack lite CGN using softwires.  This evolved approach not only applies to IPv6 networks but also includes support for IPv4 networks.</t></abstract>
