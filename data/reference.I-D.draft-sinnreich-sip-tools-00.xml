<abstract><t>The number of SIP related standards can be significantly reduced for various application scenarios by (1) using SIP without "network based services" and (2) without emulating the telephone network. Such an approach reduces the number of SIP related standards (as by mid 2006) from roughly 100 to about 11. Core SIP interoperability and SIP compliance can be preserved without relying on complex server based networks. Successful IP communications must also include the relevant standards for NAT traversal, some of which are not directly related to SIP and also several standards for security. These standards are included here as well.</t></abstract>
