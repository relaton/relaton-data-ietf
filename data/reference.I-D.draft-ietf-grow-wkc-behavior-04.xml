<abstract><t>Popular BGP implementations manipulate Well-known Communities differently from one another.  This results in difficulties for operators.  Network operators are encouraged to deploy consistent community handling across their networks, taking the inconsistent behaviors from the various BGP implementations they operate into consideration.  This document recommends specific action items to limit future inconsistency, namely BGP implementors are expected to not create any further inconsistencies from this point forward.</t></abstract>
