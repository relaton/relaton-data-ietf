<abstract><t>This document is published for the historical record.  It was one of the candidates for the IETF's Next Generation (IPng) work, and became the basis for IPv6.  The publication date of the original Internet Draft was November 10, 1992.  This document specifies a new version of IP called SIP, the Simple Internet Protocol.  It also describes the changes needed to ICMP, IGMP, and transport protocols such as TCP and UDP, in order to work with SIP.  A companion document [SIP-ADDR] describes the addressing and routing aspects of SIP, including issues of auto-configuration, host and subnet mobility, and multicast.</t></abstract>
