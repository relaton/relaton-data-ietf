<abstract><t>When a Path Computation Element(PCE) is a Label Switching Router (LSR) participating in the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), or even a server participating in IGP, its presence and path computation capabilities can be advertised using IGP flooding.  [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] define a method to advertise path computation capabilities using IGP flooding for OSPF and ISIS respectively.  However [RFC5088] and [RFC5089] lacks a method to advertise PCEP security (e.g., Transport Layer Security(TLS)) support capability.  This document proposes new capability flag bit for PCE-CAP-FLAGS sub- TLV that can be announced as attribute in the IGP advertisement (defined in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089]) to distribute PCEP security support information.</t></abstract>
