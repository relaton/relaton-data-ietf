<abstract><t>Well-Known BGP Communities are manipulated inconsistently by current implementations.  This results in difficulties for operators. Network operators are encouraged to deploy consistent community handling across their networks, taking the inconsistent behaviors from the various bgp implementations they operate into consideration. Also, bgp implementors are expected to not create any further inconsistencies from this point forward.</t></abstract>
