<abstract><t>By the early 1990s, it had become clear that RFC 1036, then the specification for the Interchange of USENET Messages, was badly in need of repair.  This &quot;Internet-Draft-to-be&quot;, though never formally published at that time, was widely circulated and became the de facto standard for implementors of News Servers and User Agents, rapidly acquiring the nickname &quot;Son of 1036&quot;.  Indeed, under that name, it could fairly be described as the best-known Internet Draft (n)ever published, and it formed the starting point for the recently adopted Proposed Standards for Netnews.</t><t>It is being published now in order to provide the historical background out of which those standards have grown.  Present-day implementors should be aware that it is NOT NOW APPROPRIATE for use in current implementations.  This document defines a Historic  Document for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
