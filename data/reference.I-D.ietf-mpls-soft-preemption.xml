<abstract><t>This document specifies Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol modifications extending the concept of preemption with the goal of reducing/ eliminating traffic disruption of preempted Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs).  Initially MPLS RSVP-TE was defined supporting only immediate TE LSP displacement upon preemption.  The utilization of a reroute request notification helps more gracefully mitigate the re-route process of preempted TE LSP.  For the brief period soft preemption is activated, reservations (though not necessarily traffic levels) are in effect under-provisioned until the TE LSP(s) can be re-routed.  For this reason, the feature is primarily but not exclusively interesting in MPLS enabled IP networks with Differentiated Services and Traffic Engineering capabilities.</t></abstract>
