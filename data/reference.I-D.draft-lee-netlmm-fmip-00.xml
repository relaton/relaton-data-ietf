<abstract><t>The PMIPv6 protocol provides local mobility to a mobile node without requiring any modification of the mobile node. A PMIPv6 domain contains multiple MAGs which the mobile node is attached to, and they advertise the same prefix to the mobile node so that the mobile node feels like it is always on the same link. However, horizontal/ vertical handover still happens while the mobile node moves among MAGs in a PMIPv6 domain, and this handover could give undesirable delay to mobile nodes running real time applications, such as VoIP. To solve this problem, this memo proposes a fast handover for PMIPv6 based on 802.11 networks. This scheme uses IAPP to transfer context information like the mobile node's authentication information and HNP.</t></abstract>
