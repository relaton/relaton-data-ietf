<abstract><t>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides support for flow level multi-pathing with rapid failover for both unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology and link technology between TRILL switches. Active-active at the TRILL edge is the extension, in so far as practical, of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected to a TRILL campus. This informational document discusses the high level problems and requirements when providing active-active connection at the TRILL edge.</t></abstract>
