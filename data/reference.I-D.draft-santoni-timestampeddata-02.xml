<abstract><t>This document describes a syntax which can be used to bind a generic document (or any set of data, not necessarily protected by means of cryptographic techniques) to one or more time-stamp tokens obtained for that document, where "time-stamp token" has the meaning defined in [TSP]. Additional types of temporal evidence are also supported. Whereas digital time stamping has become the standard technique for proving the existence of a document before a certain point in time, there is not a generally accepted syntax for keeping together one document and the associated time-stamps in a single "bundle". Such a syntax would facilitate keeping track of which time-stamps belong to what documents and would therefore improve the efficiency of timestamp-aware applications. This document proposes a simple syntax based on [CMS], by defining a new contentType.</t></abstract>
