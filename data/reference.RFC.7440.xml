<title>TFTP Windowsize Option</title>

<abstract><t>The &quot;Trivial File Transfer Protocol&quot; (RFC 1350) is a simple, lockstep, file transfer protocol that allows a client to get or put a file onto a remote host.  One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a Local Area Network (LAN).  TFTP has been used for this application because it is very simple to implement.  The employment of a lockstep scheme limits throughput when used on a LAN.</t><t>This document describes a TFTP option that allows the client and server to negotiate a window size of consecutive blocks to send as an alternative for replacing the single-block lockstep schema.  The TFTP option mechanism employed is described in &quot;TFTP Option Extension&quot; (RFC 2347).</t></abstract>
