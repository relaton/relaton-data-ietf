<abstract><t>This document defines the metric of network capacity, including link capacity aspect, router capacity aspect and path capacity aspect. RFC5136 has defined link capacity and path capacity, where the router impact is implicitly considered in link capacity.  However, in this document, router capacity is considerred as a separate factor of path capacity, no longer a factor of link capacity.  This document explicitly describes the router capacity and its impact to network capacity, e.g. how to evaluate path capacity.  This document is derived from RFC5136 and obsoletes RFC5136.</t></abstract>
