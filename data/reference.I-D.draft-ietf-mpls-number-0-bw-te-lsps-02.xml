<abstract><t>Several Link-type sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and ISIS in the context of MPLS Traffic Engineering in order to advertise some link characteristics such as the available bandwidth, traffic engineering metric, administrative group and so on. There are various circumstances (for example in order to load balance unconstrained TE Label Switched Path (LSP) across a set of equal cost paths) where it would be useful to also advertise the number of unconstrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path(s) (TE LSP) signalled across a link. This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic Engineering sub-TLV used to advertise the number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalled across a link.</t></abstract>
