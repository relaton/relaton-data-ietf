<abstract><t>This document specifies a base profile for X.509 v3 Certificates and X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for use with the United States National Security Agency's Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite.  The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems that employ such X.509 certificates.  US National Security Systems are described in NIST Special Publication 800-59. It is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information.  It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</t></abstract>
