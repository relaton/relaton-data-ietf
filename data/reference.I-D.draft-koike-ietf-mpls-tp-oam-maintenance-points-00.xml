<abstract><t>MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is expected to be one of the promising future transport technologies which will realize carrier grade packet transport network and complement future development of network. One of the most important features in MPLS-TP is the OAM tool/function which enables operators or service providers to provide various kinds of service characteristics such as prompt fault location, substantial survivability, performance monitoring, preliminary or in-service measurement and so on. Considering those new feature as transport profile, the definition of the maintenance points at which OAM messages are initiated, terminated and reacted are very important. This document describes the guidance and requirements regarding those maintenance points in MPLS-TP network.</t></abstract>
