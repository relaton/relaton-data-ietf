<abstract><t>This document describes techniques for allowing sites running the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP [LISP]) to interoperate with Internet sites not running LISP.  A fundamental property of LISP- speaking sites is that they use Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), rather than traditional IP addresses, in the source and destination fields of all traffic they emit or receive.  While EIDs are syntactically identical to IP addresses, routes for them are not carried in the global routing system so an interoperability mechanism is needed for non-LISP-speaking sites to exchange traffic with LISP-speaking sites. This document introduces two such mechanisms: the first uses a new network element, the LISP Proxy Tunnel Router (PTR) (Section 5) to act as a intermediate LISP Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR) for non-LISP- speaking hosts while the second adds Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality to LISP Ingress and LISP Egress Tunnel Routers (xTRs) to substitute routable IP addresses for non-routable EIDs.</t></abstract>
