<abstract><t>This document describes the DNS Proxy that is separated from NAT-PT [RFC2766].  NAT-PT was designed to work with DNS Application Level Gateway.  However [RFC4966] pointed out DNS related issues, and [RFC2766] was changed to historical state.  This document attempts to DNS Proxy specification, removing dependency on NAT-PT as well as resolving problems pointed in [RFC4966].</t></abstract>
