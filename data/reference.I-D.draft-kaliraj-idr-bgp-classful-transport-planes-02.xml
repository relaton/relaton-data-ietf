<abstract><t>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "service mapping", to express association of overlay routes with underlay routes satisfying a certain SLA, using BGP.  The document describes a framework for classifying underlay routes into transport classes, and mapping service routes to specific transport class.  The transport class maps to a desired SLA.  It specifies BGP protocol procedures that enable dissimination of such service mapping information that may span across administrative domains.  It makes it possible to advertise multiple tunnels to the same destination.  A new BGP transport layer address family (SAFI 76) is defined for this purpose that uses RFC-4364 technology and follows RFC-8277 NLRI encoding.  This new address family is called "BGP Classful Transport", aka BGP-CT.  It carries transport prefixes across tunnel domain boundaries (e.g. in Inter-AS Option-C networks), parallel to BGP-LU (SAFI 4) . It dissiminates "Transport class" information for the transport prefixes across the participating domains, which is not possible with BGP-LU. This makes the end-to-end network a "Transport Class" aware tunneled network.</t></abstract>
