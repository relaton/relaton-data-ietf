<abstract><t>A number of enhancements to LDP as specified in [RFC3036] have been proposed. Some have been implemented, and some are advancing toward standardization. It is likely that additional enhancements will be proposed in the future. At present LDP has no common mechanism for LDP speakers to activate such enhancements. Consequently, the enhancement specifications typically include ad hoc procedures for activating the enhancement at session initialization time. This draft specifies an LDP mechanism for activating enhancements that allows LDP peers to enable and disable them at any time following session establishment.</t></abstract>
