<abstract><t>In this document we consider and analyse the specific scenario of IPv6 transition and deployment in a large department of a university campus network. The department is large enough to operate its own instances of all the conventional university services including (for example) web, DNS, email, filestore, interactive logins, and remote and wireless access. The scenario is a dual-stack one, i.e. transition to IPv6 means deploying IPv6 in the first instance alongside IPv4. This analysis will both identify the available (and still missing) components for IPv6 transition, and also test the applicability of the recently completed IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios document.</t></abstract>
