<abstract><t>The draft describes an interface to the discovery of services on a bounded network segment from a building control perspective. Building control has special boundary conditions related to: (1) management of devices and services, (2) an installation involving stand-alone networks (3) (dis)connecting network (from) to Internet without renaming services and devices.  Roaming devices are not considered in this version.  Note  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to dnssd@ietf.org.</t></abstract>
