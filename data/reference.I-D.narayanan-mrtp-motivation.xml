<abstract><t>We proposed a new multi-flow real time protocol (MRTP) in our earlier internet-draft [1] for carrying real-time data through multiple paths between the source and the destination. There are a various advantages in multipath data transport as demonstrated by [2][3] [5][8]. MRTP would provide an end-to-end transport services over multiple flows and paths to real time data. In this draft we discuss the motivation for needing such a standardized protocol to encourage further discussion on the requirement for a multi-path transport protocol.</t></abstract>
