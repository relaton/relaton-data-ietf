<abstract><t>The LED-based Visible Light Communication (VLC) has been proposed as the IEEE 802.15.7-2011 standard and regarded as a new wireless access medium in IoT environment. With this trend, many works have so far been made to improve the performance of VLC. However, how to effectively integrate VLC services into IoT networks has not been studied enough. In this document, we propose a scheme for device management and data transport in IoT networks using VLC. Specifically, we discuss how to manage VLC transmitters and receivers, and to support VLC data transmission in IoT networks. The proposed scheme considers uni-directional VLC transmissions from transmitter to receivers for delivery of location-based VLC data. The backward transmission from VLC receivers will be made by using platform server and aggregation agents in the network.</t></abstract>
