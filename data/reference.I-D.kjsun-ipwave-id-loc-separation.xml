<abstract><t>ID/Location separation protocols are proposed for scalable routing, enhancing mobility and privacy in IPv6-based vehicular networks.  In IPv6-based vehicular networks, ID/Location separation architecture is expected to offer benefits.  This document analyzes how ID/Location separation protocols can adjust into IP based vehicular networks and suggests requirements for efficient ID/Location separation in vehicular networks.</t></abstract>
