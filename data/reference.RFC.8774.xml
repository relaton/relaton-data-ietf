<abstract><t>The age of quantum networking is upon us, and with it comes &quot;entanglement&quot;: a procedure in which a state (i.e., a bit) can be transferred instantly, with no measurable delay between peers.  This will lead to a perceived round-trip time of zero seconds on some Internet paths, a capability which was not predicted and so not included as a possibility in many protocol specifications.  Worse than the millennium bug, this unexpected value is bound to cause serious Internet failures unless the specifications are fixed in time.</t></abstract>
