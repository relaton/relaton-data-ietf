<abstract><t>This memo documents a long-standing technique supported by a large number of mail servers which allows users to be notified of new mail. In addition to server support, there are a number of clients which support this, ranging from full email clients to specialized clients whose only purpose is to receive new mail notifications and alert a mail client. In brief, the technique is for the server to send the string 'nm_notifyuser' to the finger port on the IP address (either configured or last used) for the user who has received new mail.</t></abstract>
