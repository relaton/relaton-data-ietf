<abstract><t>This document describes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) mechanism that provides basic IP multicast forwarding suitable for wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) use.  SMF specifies techniques for multicast duplicate packet detection (DPD) to assist the forwarding process.  SMF also specifies DPD maintenance and checking operations consistent with both IPv4 and IPv6.  SMF takes advantage of reduced relay sets for efficient MANET multicast forwarding within a mesh topology and the document describes protocol interaction with a number of approaches.  Candidate algorithms for selecting reduced relay sets and related discussion is provided in the Appendices.  Basic issues relating to the operation of multicast MANET border routers are discussed but ongoing work remains in this area beyond the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
