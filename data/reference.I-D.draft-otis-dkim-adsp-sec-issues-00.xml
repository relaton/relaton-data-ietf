<abstract><t>[I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] defines DNS records that advertise the extent to which a domain employs [RFC4871] to sign [RFC2822] messages, and how other hosts access these advertisements.  The goal is to control the use of From header field.  When a message is not adequately signed, advertised assertions referenced by a domain in the From header field assist in resolving the message's intended disposition.  However, [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] fails to discern that when restricted identities are imposed upon remote signing agents, additional controls must be afforded the domain in this case.  The draft also ignores the predominate role of the domain, and assumes the signature always makes assertions regarding the identity of the author, which ignores safety and goes well beyond the charter.  In addition, the only directly actionable practice is defined using a term likely to negatively impact the integrity of delivery status as well.  [I-D.ietf-dkim-ssp] impairs security in other ways, but fortunately minor changes to the definition of a valid signature can significantly remedy the most critical security issue.</t></abstract>
