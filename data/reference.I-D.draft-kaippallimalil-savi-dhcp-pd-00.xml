<abstract><t>This memo introduces a public access topology which includes hosts, Customer Premise Equipment Router (CPE-R), switches and access routers.  A CPE-R advertises prefixes to a host for its address configuration, while these prefixes are in turn delegated to the CPE-R from the access router.  A switch located between the CPE-R and the router builds filtering table for traffic originating from the host by snooping prefix delegating signaling.</t></abstract>
