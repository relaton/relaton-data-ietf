<abstract><t>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memo describes the requirements for the signaling applied within the PCN domain: (1) PCN-feedback-information is carried from the PCN-egress- node to the decision point;(2) the decision point may ask the PCN- ingress-node to measure, and report back, the rate of sent PCN- traffic between that PCN-ingress-node and PCN-egress-node. The decision point may be either collocated with the PCN-ingress-node or a centralized node (in the latter case, (2) is not required). The signaling requirements pertain in particular to two edge behaviours, "controlled load (CL)" and "single marking (SM)" [draft-ietf-pcn-cl-edge- behaviour-09], [draft-ietf-pcn-sm-edge-behaviour-06].</t></abstract>
