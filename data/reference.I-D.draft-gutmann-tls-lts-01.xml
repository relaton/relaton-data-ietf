<abstract><t>This document specifies a profile of TLS 1.2 for long-term support, one that represents what's already deployed for TLS 1.2 but with the security holes and bugs fixed.  This represents a stable, known-good profile that can be deployed now to systems that can't roll out patches every month or two when the next attack on TLS is published.</t></abstract>
