<abstract><t>The use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that each user's machine is configured with the user's identities.  This will require something on that machine which will manage the user's identities and services.  Anyone designing that "something" will face the same set of challenges.  This document aims to document these challenges with the aim of producing well-thought out UIs with some consistency.</t></abstract>
