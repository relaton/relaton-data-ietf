<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 defines a return-routability procedure for secure use of route optimization between unacquainted nodes. Unfortunately, this procedure is known to have undesired impacts on handoff latency. This document specifies extensions to Mobile IPv6 that eliminate the latency of the return-routability procedure. The extensions thus provide a basis for more efficient reactive as well as proactive handoff management. They are optional and fully backward-compatible.</t></abstract>
