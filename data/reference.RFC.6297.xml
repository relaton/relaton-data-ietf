<abstract><t>This document provides a survey of transport protocols that are designed to have a smaller bandwidth and/or delay impact on standard TCP than standard TCP itself when they share a bottleneck with it. Such protocols could be used for delay-insensitive &quot;background&quot; traffic, as they provide what is sometimes called a &quot;less than&quot; (or &quot;lower than&quot;) best-effort service.  This document is not an  Internet Standards Track specification; it is published  for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
