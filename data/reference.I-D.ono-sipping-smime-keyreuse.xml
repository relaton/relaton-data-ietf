<abstract><t>The SIP User Agent uses Secure MIME (S/MIME) Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) EnvelopedData to protect SIP messages for confidentiality. While SIP messages can be encrypted with different keying materials for each message in a dialog, it usually requires a public key operation for each message and the computational cost of such operations are relatively expensive. This draft proposes a method of bidirectional key exchange to reuse keying materials for S/MIME-secured messages in a dialog and use a symmetric key mechanism instead of an asymmetric key mechanism such as a public key operation. The proposed mechanism also achieves the sharing of keying material among multiple entities simply.</t></abstract>
