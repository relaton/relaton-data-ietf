<abstract><t>This document describes a method for a client or resource server utilizing an OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] authorization server when responding to a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] GET request with the Observe option [I-D.ietf-core-observe].  CoAP's Observe option has the potential to reduce network traffic by allowing clients to get updates on protected resources as the protected resource's values change rather than polling the protected resource periodically.  A client adding the Observe option to a CoAP GET request has the greatest impact on the device providing the protected resource since the resource server (RS) has to maintain a list of requestors and deal with tokens associated with those requests. Additionally an Authorization Server (AS) could potentially allow token introspection to happen over a GET request with the Observe option, further reducing network usage and heavy lifting on the part of the resource server doing the introspection.</t></abstract>
