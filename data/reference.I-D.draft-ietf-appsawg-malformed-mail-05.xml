<abstract><t>Although Internet mail formats have been precisely defined since the 1970s, authoring and handling software often show only mild conformance to the specifications.  The distributed and non- interactive nature of email has often prompted adjustments to receiving software, to handle these variations, rather than trying to gain better conformance by senders, since the receiving operator is primarily driven by complaining recipient users and has no authority over the sending side of the system.  Processing with such flexibility comes at some cost, since mail software is faced with decisions about whether or not to permit non-conforming messages to continue toward their destinations unaltered, adjust them to conform (possibly at the cost of losing some of the original message), or outright rejecting them.  A core requirement for interoperability is that both sides of an exchange work from the same details and semantics.  By having receivers be flexible, beyond the specifications, there can be -- and often has been -- a good chance that a message will not be fully interoperable.  Worse, a well-established pattern of tolerance for variations can sometimes be used as an attack vector.  This document includes a collection of the best advice available regarding a variety of common malformed mail situations, to be used as implementation guidance.  It must be emphasized, however, that the intent of this document is not to standardize malformations or otherwise encourage their proliferation.  The messages are manifestly malformed, and the code and culture that generates them needs to be fixed.  Therefore, these messages should be rejected outright if at all possible.  Nevertheless, many malformed messages from otherwise legitimate senders are in circulation and will be for some time, and, unfortunately, commercial reality shows that we cannot always simply reject or discard them.  Accordingly, this document presents alternatives for dealing with them in ways that seem to do the least additional harm until the infrastructure is tightened up to match the standards.</t></abstract>
