<abstract><t>The IETF specifies several algorithms operating in the data plane of a network node, including liveliness detection, congestion control, network measurement, security, and load balancing.  Such algorithms are commonly specified using English or flow charts.  As an alternative, this document proposes that P4 programs can be used to specify some data plane algorithms.  P4 is a programming language created in 2014 to program the data plane of network nodes such as switches, routers, smartNICs, and generic compute targets.</t></abstract>
