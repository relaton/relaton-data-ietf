<abstract><t>The topology refresh protocol is intended for use in mobile social networks where user nodes announce their presence when they move into contact with the network, see all existing users, know when old users have left the network and new ones join the network, and communicate with each other over optimal paths established on the fly.  TRP is a very lightweight protocol but does require user nodes periodically broadcast their ids along with some personal information to the network.  These broadcasts serve the dual purpose of announcing users' presence in the social network and establishing a complete topology of end-to-end optimal paths.  Individual user controls her "radius of users" based on the number of hops and physical distance between her and the others.  User nodes independently choose their ids and dynamically resolve any duplicated ones.</t></abstract>
