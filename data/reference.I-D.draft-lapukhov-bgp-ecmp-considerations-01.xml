<abstract><t>BGP routing protocol defined in ([RFC4271]) employs tie-breaking logic to elect single best path among multiple possible.  At the same time, it has been common in all practical BGP implementations to allow for "equal-cost multipath" (ECMP) path election and programming of multiple next-hops in routing tables.  This documents provides some common considerations for the ECMP logic, with the intent of providing common reference on otherwise unstandardized feature.</t></abstract>
