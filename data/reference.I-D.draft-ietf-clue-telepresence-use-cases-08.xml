<abstract><t>Telepresence conferencing systems seek to create an environment that gives non co-located users or user groups a feeling of co-located presence through multimedia communication including at least audio and video signals of high fidelity.  A number of techniques for handling audio and video streams are used to create this experience. When these techniques are not similar, interoperability between different systems is difficult at best, and often not possible. Conveying information about the relationships between multiple streams of media would allow senders and receivers to make choices to allow telepresence systems to interwork.  This memo describes the most typical and important use cases for sending multiple streams in a telepresence conference.</t></abstract>
