<abstract><t>This document describes an interface between mobile nodes (MN) and mobility access gateway (MAG) of a network-based localized mobility management (NETLMM) domain. The interface has two functions which are invocated when a MN attaches and detaches from a MAG. The attachment function let the MAG authenticate the MN identifier, does address(es) and default router configuration for the MN, and inform the MAG about the multicast listener state of the MN. During a successful execution of the detachment function, the NETLMM protocol is triggered between the MAG and the localized mobility anchor (LMA). The detachment function let the MAG detect that the MN has left so that it can deregister the MN at the LMA using the NETLMM protocol.</t></abstract>
