<abstract><t>Loss Recovery by means of T3-Retransmission has significant detrimental impact on the delays experienced through an SCTP association.  The throughput achievable over an SCTP association also is negatively impacted by the occurence of T3-Retransmissions.  Loss Recovery by Fast Retransmission operation is in most situations superior to T3-Retransmission from a latency and a throughput perspective.  The present SCTP Fast Recovery algorithms as specified by [RFC4960] are not able to adequately or timely recover losses in certain situations, thus resorting to loss recovery by lengthy T3-Retransimissions or by non-timely activation of Fast Recovery.  In this document we propose for a number of enhancements to the SCTP Loss Recovery algorithms aimed to amend some of these deficiencies with a particular focus on Loss Recovery for drops in Traffic Tails. The enhancements supplements the existing algorithms of [RFC4960] with proactive probing and timer driven accelerated activation of the Fast Retransmission algorithm as well as a number of enhancements of the Fast Retransmission algorithm in itself are proposed.  The enhancement are proposed as supplements to the Loss Recovery algorithms of [RFC4960] and as such they do not deprecate or replace any of the mechanisms defined by [RFC4960].  The solution proposed draws on prior art in the area of SCTP and TCP Loss Recovery improvements.  The mechanisms proposed include the adjustment to SCTP Fast Retransmission of certain improvements specified for TCP Fast Retransmission by [RFC6675] as well as the proposal embeds SCTP Early Retransmit [RFC5827] in a delayed variant. The proposal heavily draws on the ideas put forward for TCP by [DUKKIPATI01] for proactive probing and timer driven entering of Fast Recovery procedures.  The proposal embeds certain aspects from [HURTIG] when applicable.  The procedures proposed are sender-side only and do not impact the SCTP receiver.</t></abstract>
