<abstract><t>This document defines a protocol, BMP, that can be used to monitor BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a convenient interface for obtaining route views.  Prior to introduction of BMP, screen-scraping was the most commonly-used approach to obtaining such views.  The design goals are to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented, and minimally service-affecting.  BMP is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.</t></abstract>
