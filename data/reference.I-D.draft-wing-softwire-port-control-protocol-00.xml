<abstract><t>It is desirable to operate a server behind a device that does not normally permit operating a server, such as a carrier's NAT64, a carrier's NAT44, or an IPv6 customer premise router that filters incoming packets.  This document proposes an application-level protocol, derived from NAT-PMP, to allow a host to request opening a port in such an upstream device.</t></abstract>
