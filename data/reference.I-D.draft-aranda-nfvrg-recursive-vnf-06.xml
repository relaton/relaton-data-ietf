<abstract><t>Current efforts in the scope of Network Function Virtualisation(NFV) propose YAML-based descriptors for Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and for their composition in Network Services (NS) These descriptors are human-readable but hardly understandable by humans.  On the other hand, there has been an effort proposed to the IETF to define a human-readable (and understandable) representation for networks, known as NEMO.  In this draft, we propose a simple extension to NEMO to accommodate VNF Descriptors (VNFDs) in a similar manner as inline assembly is integrated in higher-level programming languages.  This approach enables the creation of recursive VNF forwarding graphs in Service Descriptors, practically making them recursive.  An implementation generating VNF Descriptors (VNFDs) for OpenMANO and OSM is available.</t></abstract>
