<abstract><t>This specification defines a new Mobile IPv4 extension which is used to negotiate the Multicast-Broadcast Encapsulation Delivery style in the case of Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Care-of Address mode registration.  This mechanism allows the mobile node to negotiate which type of traffic to be delivered encapsulated to the foreign agent while delivering other types of IP packets using direct delivery style.  In particular, this mechanism gives the flexibility to eliminate tunnel overhead in the (typically) wireless medium between the mobile node and the foreign agent.  In addition to the reduced overhead, the new mechanism makes many multicast and broadcast services available to the mobile node in a much more deterministic and efficient way.</t></abstract>
