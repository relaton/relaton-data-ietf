<abstract><t>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. This document considers the case when the "requesting router" is actually an end system which receives a delegated prefix that it can use for its own sub-delegation and/or multi-addressing purposes.</t></abstract>
