<abstract><t>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Bulk Update/Replication Protocol (LBURP) allows an LDAP client to perform a bulk update to an LDAP server.  The protocol frames a sequenced set of update operations within a pair of LDAP extended operations to notify the server that the update operations in the framed set are related in such a way that the ordering of all operations can be preserved during processing even when they are sent asynchronously by the client.  Update operations can be grouped within a single protocol message to maximize the efficiency of client-server communication.</t><t>The protocol is suitable for efficiently making a substantial set of updates to the entries in an LDAP server.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
