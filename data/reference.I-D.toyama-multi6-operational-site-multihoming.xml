<abstract><t>This document proposes an operational solution of IPv6 mulithoming. This approach is that a group of providers administrates cooperatively one prefix and one autonomous system number (ASN) for only their multihoming customers; each multihomed customer is assigned a longer prefix, such as /48, but only address block of /32 allocated by RIR is advertised through the providers of the group to the global IPv6 Internet. This approach does not need allocation of provider-independent address block to each customer who needs multihomed network, and therefore saves IPv6 address space.</t></abstract>
