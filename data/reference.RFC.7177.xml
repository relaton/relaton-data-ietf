<abstract><t>The IETF Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL switches, including point-to-point links and multi-access Local Area Network (LAN) links that can have multiple TRILL switches and end stations attached.  TRILL uses Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing.  This document specifies the establishment, reporting, and termination of IS-IS adjacencies between TRILL switches, also known as RBridges (Routing Bridges).  It also concerns four other link-local aspects of TRILL: Designated RBridge (DRB) selection, MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) testing, pseudonode creation, and BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) session bootstrapping in connection with adjacency.  State diagrams are included where appropriate.  This document obsoletes RFC 6327 and updates RFC 6325.</t></abstract>
