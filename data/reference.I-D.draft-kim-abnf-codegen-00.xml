<abstract><t>This document describes an ABNF extension for code generation. The extension has two features; extension rule and non-sequence group notations. The extension rules are used to direct the parser generator with things like data types, variable names, forced value for a variable, etc. The non-sequence group feature was proposed as part of RFC 2234 in the past, but dropped due to its ambiguities. The  feature is proposed again in this document not as a fundamental building block, but as an add-on. The elements of a non-sequence group are unordered, and are allowed multiple appearance.We attempt to minimize the ambiguities stemmed from repetition of an element by defining specific repetition rules for elements of a non-sequence group and non-sequence group themselves.</t></abstract>
