<abstract><t>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to- Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths. The existing specification for this functionality assumes that a downstream LSR selects only one upstream LSR for a P2MP or MP2MP LSP. A Make-Before-Break (MBB) procedure in mLdp base specification [MLDP] for graceful upstream LSR change but that is not applicable when the upstream LSR node fails. As IPTV deployments grow in number and size, service providers are looking for solutions that minimize the service disruption due to such failures. This document describes a set of procedures that minimize packet loss when an upstream LSR node fails. This document does not change any specifications of mLdp protocol as defined in [MLDP] and so there are no inter-operability requirements for the procedures described in this document.</t></abstract>
