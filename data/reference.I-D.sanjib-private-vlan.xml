<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism to achieve device isolation through the application of special Layer 2 forwarding constraints. Such mechanism allows end devices to share the same IP subnet while being Layer 2 isolated, which in turn allows network designers to employ larger subnets and so reduce the address management overhead.  Some of the numerous deployment scenarios of the aforementioned mechanism (which range from data center designs to Ethernet-to-the- home basement networks) are mentioned in the following to exemplify its possible usages; however, this document is not intended to cover all such deployment scenarios nor delve into their details.</t></abstract>
