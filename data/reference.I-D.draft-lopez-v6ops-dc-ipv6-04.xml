<abstract><t>This document is intended to provide operational guidelines for datacenter operators planning to deploy IPv6 in their infrastructures.  It aims to offer a reference framework for evaluating different products and architectures, and therefore it is also addressed to manufacturers and solution providers, so they can use it to gauge their solutions.  We believe this will translate in a smoother and faster IPv6 transition for datacenters of these infrastuctures.  The document focuses on the DC infrastructure itself, its operation, and the aspects related to DC interconnection through IPv6.  It does not consider the particular mechanisms for making Internet services provided by applications hosted in the DC available through IPv6 beyond the specific aspects related to how their deployment on the DC infrastructure.  Apart from facilitating the transition to IPv6, the mechanisms outlined here are intended to make this transition as transparent as possible (if not completely transparent) to applications and services running on the DC infrastructure, as well as to take advantage of IPv6 features to simplify DC operations, internally and across the Internet.</t></abstract>
