<abstract><t>RBridges use the TRILL protocol, which in turn makes use of an extended version of the IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) routing protocol to determine topology and frame forwarding. RBridges provide optimal pair-wise forwarding with zero configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and multipathing for both unicast and multicast traffic. Rbridges also support VLANs. This document is an early specification of the details of TRILL use of IS-IS for purposes of discussion</t></abstract>
