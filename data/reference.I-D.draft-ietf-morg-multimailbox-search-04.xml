<abstract><t>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected mailbox.  A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the next.  This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes with one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for various searches to complete, and not requiring disruption of the currently selected mailbox.  This also uses MAILBOX and TAG fields in ESEARCH responses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.  Note  A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community.  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to morg@ietf.org.</t></abstract>
