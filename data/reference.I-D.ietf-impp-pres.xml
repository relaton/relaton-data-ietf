<abstract><t>Presence is defined in RFC2778 [12]. Today, numerous presence protocols are in use (largely as components of commercial instant messaging services), and little interoperability between services based on these protocols has been achieved. This specification defines common semantics and data formats for presence to facilitate the creation of gateways between presence services.</t></abstract>
