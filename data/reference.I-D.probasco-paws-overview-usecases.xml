<abstract><t>Wireless spectrum is a commodity that is regulated by governments. The spectrum is used for various purposes which include entertainment (eg. radio and television), communication (telephony and Internet access), military (radars etc.) and, navigation (satellite communication, GPS).  Portions of the radio spectrum that are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white space".  TV White space refers to those unused channels, within the range allocated for TV transmission, that can be used without interfering with the primary purpose for which it is allocated.  This document describes examples of how a radio system might operate using TV white space spectrum and associated requirements.  Not only does it describe the operation of a radio system, but also how the radio system including a white space database enables additional services.</t></abstract>
