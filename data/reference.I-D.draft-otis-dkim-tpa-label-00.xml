<abstract><t>TPA-label is a DNS-based prefix mechanism for DKIM policy related records as a means to authorize Third-Party domains, such as mailing- lists.  This mechanism allows first-party domains to autonomously authorize a range of third-party domains using scalable, individual DNS transactions.  This authorization extends the scope of DKIM policy assertions as a means to supplant more difficult to administer mechanisms.  Alternatives for facilitating third-party authorizations currently necessitate coordination between two or more domains to synchronously set up selector/key DNS records, DNS zone delegations, or the regular exchange of public/private keys.  Checking DKIM policies may occur when a From header email-address is not within the domain of a valid DKIM signature.  When a Third-Party signature is found, TPA-Labels offer an efficient means for email address domains to authorize specific third-party signing domains.</t></abstract>
