<abstract><t>This document specifies a value for the extendedKeyUsage X.509 extension that may be used to create a certificate that would be used to sign attribute assertions.  This allows the differentiation of certificates used to identify a particular server (which would have a serverAuth EKU), from the certificate used by that server to sign attribute assertions, and would easily allow a policy to be developed for issuance of such a certificate to an identity provider.</t></abstract>
