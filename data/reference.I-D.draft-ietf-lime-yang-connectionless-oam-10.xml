<abstract><t>This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless Operations Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols.  It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for connectionless protocols.  The base model presented here can be extended to include technology specific details.  This is leading to uniformity between OAM protocols and support both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different or same levels through a unified interface) and interacting OAM workflows ( i.e., performing OAM functions at same levels through a unified interface).</t></abstract>
