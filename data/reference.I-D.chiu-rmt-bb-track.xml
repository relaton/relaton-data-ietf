<abstract><t>The Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group has been chartered to standardize reliable multicast transport services and protocol instantiations, which include the tree-based ACK (TRACK) protocol. This document describes the RMT Building Block for Tree- based ACK (TRACK) mechanisms. It contains functions relating to positive acknowledgments and hierarchical tree construction and maintenance. It might primarily be used as part of the TRACK Protocol Instantiation. According to the charter, a building block is 'a coarse-grained modular component that is common to multiple protocols along with abstract APIs that define a building block's access methods and their arguments.' The TRACK BB mechanisms will operate on the logical ACK-tree that is configured by the TREE BB [10] in the TRACK PI sessions. This document is made based on the guidelines for the RMT BB [5].</t></abstract>
