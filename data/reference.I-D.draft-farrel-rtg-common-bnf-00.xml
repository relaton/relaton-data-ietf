<abstract><t>Several protocols within the Routing Area have been specified using a common variant of the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) of representing message syntax. However, there is no formal definition of this version of BNF.  There is value in using the same variant of BNF for the set of protocols that are commonly used together. This reduces confusion and simplifies implementation.  Updating exsting documents to use some other variant of BNF that is already formally documented would be a substantial piece of work.  This document provides a formal deinition of the variant of BNF that has been used, and makes it available for use by new protocols.</t></abstract>
