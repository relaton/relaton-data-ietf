<abstract><t>This document describes a revised model for the management, evolution and improvement of the RFC Series led by an RFC Series Editor (RSE) assisted by an RFC Series Editorial Board (RSEB).  The model removes the IAB and its appointed RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) from direct control of the RFC Series and the RFC Series Editor, replacing them on the publication evolution side with the RSEB, and on the financial and personnel management side with the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company or its board as appropriate (LLC).</t></abstract>
