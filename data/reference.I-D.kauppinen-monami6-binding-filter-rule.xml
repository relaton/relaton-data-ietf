<abstract><t>Mobile nodes using more than one interface for communicating with other nodes in the network need a mechanism that controls how these interfaces are used. One way of controlling the interface usage is to define rules that map flows to network interfaces. These rules can also be called filter rules that are bound to Filter Interface Identifiers. This document describes a mechanism to associate Filter Interface Identifiers with the current location information of a mobile node in case when the mobility protocol used by the mobile node is Mobile IPv6.</t></abstract>
