<abstract><t>The IETF is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based localized mobility management, which takes basic operation for registration, tunnel management and de-registration into account in a first protocol release.  This document proposes an extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 to suit MNs, which have multiple network interfaces implemented and hand over from one network interface to another network interface while remaining anchored at the same Local Mobility Anchor.  This extension avoids that the LMA will prematurely forward data packets for the mobile node to the mobile node's new interface before the address configuration of this interface has completed. With the proposed extension, packet buffering at the new MAG is not necessary and packet losses during an inter-technology handover can be avoided.</t></abstract>
