<abstract><t>This document specifies a network protocol that allows mobile nodes to move around in a localized mobility domain, changing their point of attachment within the domain, but without ever being aware at the IP layer that their point of attachment has ever changed, and maintaining seamless communication in the presence of such mobility events. It defines two protocol entities, a Mobile Access Gateway and a Local Mobility Anchor, and a set of messages between them, that together make these mobility events transparent to the mobile nodes at the IP layer.</t></abstract>
