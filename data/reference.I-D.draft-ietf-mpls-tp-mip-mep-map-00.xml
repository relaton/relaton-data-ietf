<abstract><t>The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs) may be situated within network nodes at the incoming and outgoing interfaces.  This document describes a way of forming OAM messages so that they can be targeted at MIPs on incoming or MIPs on outgoing interfaces, forwarded correctly through the "switch fabric", and handled efficiently in node implementations where there is no distinction between the incoming and outgoing MIP.  The material in this document is provided for discussion within the MPLS-TP community in the expectation that this idea or some similar mechanism will be subsumed into a more general MPLS-TP OAM document.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</t></abstract>
