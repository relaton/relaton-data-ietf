<abstract><t>Specifications for a number of important topics were arbitrarily omitted from the initial MVPN specifications, so that those specifications could be "frozen" and advanced.  The current document provides some of the missing specifications.  The topics covered are: (a) using Wild Card selectors to bind multicast data streams to tunnels, (b) using Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths as tunnels, (c) binding bidirectional customer multicast data streams to specific tunnels, (d) running PIM (i.e., sending and receiving multicast control traffic) over a set of tunnels that are created only if needed to carry multicast data traffic, and (e) extranets.</t></abstract>
