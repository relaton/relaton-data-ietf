<abstract><t>This document provides an applicability analysis on the use of Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and mechanisms to satisfy the requirements of the Layer 1 Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) Enhanced Mode. L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Enhanced Mode of operation features exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network and the customer domain. In addition, this document identifies areas where additional protocol extensions or procedures are needed to satisfy the requirements of the L1VPN Enhanced Mode, and provides guidelines for potential extensions.</t></abstract>
