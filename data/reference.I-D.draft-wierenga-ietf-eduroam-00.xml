<abstract><t>This document describes the architecture of the eduroam service for federated (wireless) network access in academia.  The combination of 802.1X, EAP and RADIUS that is used in eduroam provides a secure, scalable and deployable service for roaming network access.  The successful deployment of eduroam over the last decade in the educational sector may serve as an example for other sectors, hence this document.  In particular the initial architectural and standards choices and the changes that were prompted by operational experience are highlighted.</t></abstract>
