<abstract><t>This document reproduces the Host/Host Protocol developed by the ARPA Network Working Group during 1969, 1970 and 1971.  It describes a protocol used to manage communication between processes residing on independent Hosts.  It addresses issues of multiplexing multiple streams of communication over a single hardware interface including addressing, flow control, connection establishment/disestablishment, and other signaling.  It was the official protocol of the ARPA Network from January 1972 until the switch to TCP/IP in January 1983. It is offered as an "intended RFC" at this late date to help complete the historical record available through the RFC series.</t></abstract>
