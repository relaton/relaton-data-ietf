<abstract><t>This document is a collection of solutions to reveal a host identifier (denoted as HOST_ID) when a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) or application proxies are involved in the path.  This host identifier could be used by a remote server to sort out the packets by sending host.  The host identifier must be unique to each host under the same shared IP address.  This document analyzes a set of solution candidates to reveal a host identifier; no recommendation is sketched in the document.</t></abstract>
