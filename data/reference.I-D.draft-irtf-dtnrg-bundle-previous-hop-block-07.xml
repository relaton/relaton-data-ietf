<abstract><t>This document defines an extension block that may be used with the Bundle Protocol [refs.DTNBP] within the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture [refs.DTNarch].  This Previous Hop Insertion Block is designed to be inserted by a forwarding node to provide the endpoint identifier (EID) of an endpoint of which the forwarding node is a member so that this EID may be conveyed to the next-hop receiving node.  Knowledge of an EID of an endpoint of which a previous-hop node is a member may be required in some circumstances to support certain routing protocols (e.g., flood routing).  The Previous Hop Insertion block is always removed from the bundle by the receiving node so that its duration within the bundle lasts for exactly one hop.  This document defines the format and processing of this Previous Hop Insertion Block.</t></abstract>
