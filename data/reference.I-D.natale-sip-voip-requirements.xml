<abstract><t>This is an initial draft for consideration by the SPEERMINT WG as a candidate for the chartered work item dealing with "the minimum set of requirements for SIP-based VoIP interconnection (BCP)", due in March 2007. In its present form, this draft is intended solely to provide a basis for WG discussion about requirements selection. As such, it is primarily structural and descriptive in nature, leaving prescriptive content to later revisions driven by WG consensus.</t></abstract>
