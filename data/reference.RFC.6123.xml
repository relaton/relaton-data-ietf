<abstract><t>It has often been the case that manageability considerations have been retrofitted to protocols after they have been specified, standardized, implemented, or deployed.  This is sub-optimal. Similarly, new protocols or protocol extensions are frequently designed without due consideration of manageability requirements.</t><t>The Operations Area has developed &quot;Guidelines for Considering Operations and Management of New Protocols and Protocol Extensions&quot; (RFC 5706), and those guidelines have been adopted by the Path Computation Element (PCE) Working Group.</t><t>Previously, the PCE Working Group used the recommendations contained in this document to guide authors of Internet-Drafts on the contents of &quot;Manageability Considerations&quot; sections in their work.  This document is retained for historic reference.  This document  defines a Historic Document for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
