<abstract><t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is today widely used in the Internet to announce as well as negotiate multimedia sessions and exchange capabilities. Having originally been designed for session announcements only, as opposed to announcements and capabilities negotiation announcements, native SDP lacks numerous features to be applicable in many session scenarios. Numerous extensions have been developed to circumvent SDP's shortcomings -- but they have also repeatedly shown its inherent limitations. A successor protocol -- termed 'SDPng' for the time being -- is developed to address the aforementioned needs of Internet applications in a more structured manner. With the huge installed base of SDP-based applications, a migration path needs to be developed to move from SDP to SDPng over time. This document outlines how this migration can be achieved: in general as well as for the various IETF control protocols that potentially make use of SDP and SDPng.</t></abstract>
