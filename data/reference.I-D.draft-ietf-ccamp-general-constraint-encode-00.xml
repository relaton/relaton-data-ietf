<abstract><t>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching can be used to control a wide variety of technologies. In some of these technologies network elements and links may impose additional routing constraints. An example of such additional constraints occurs in wavelength switched optical networks (WSON).  This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for general information elements representing connectivity and label constraints as well as label availability. These encodings are applicable to a wide range of technologies and not limited to WSON. It is intended that protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how information is carried for specific uses.</t></abstract>
