<abstract><t>GMPLS-TE Graceful shutdown is a method for explicitly notifying the nodes in a TE network that the TE protocol on a link or on an entire TE node is going to be disabled. GMPLS-TE graceful shutdown mechanisms are tailored towards addressing the planned outage in the network. This document provides requirements and protocol mechanisms so as to reduce/eliminate traffic disruption in the event of a planned shutdown of a network resource. These operations are equally applicable for both classical MPLS and its GMPLS extensions.</t></abstract>
