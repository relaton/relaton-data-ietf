<abstract><t>Establishment and control of Label Switch Paths (LSPs) have become mainstream tools of commercial and government network providers.  One of the elements of further evolving such networks is scaling their performance in terms of LSP bandwidth and traffic loads, LSP intensity (e.g., rate of LSP creation, deletion, and modification), LSP set up delay, quality of service differentiation, and different levels of resilience.  The goal of this document is to present target scaling objectives and the related protocol requirements for Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS).</t></abstract>
