<abstract><t>Group communication services are most efficiently implemented on the lowest layer available.  However, as the deployment status of multicast technologies largely varies throughout the Internet, globally operational group solutions are frequently forced to using a stable, upper layer protocol controlled by the application itself. This document describes a common multicast API that is suitable for transparent underlay and overlay communication.  It proposes abstract naming and addressing by multicast URIs and discusses mapping mechanisms between different namespaces and distribution technologies.  Additionally, it describes the application of this API for building gateways that interconnect current multicast domains throughout the Internet.</t></abstract>
