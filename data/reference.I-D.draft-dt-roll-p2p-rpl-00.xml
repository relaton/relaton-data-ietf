<abstract><t>This draft presents mechanisms to determine the end-to-end cost of an existing route and to discover/establish "on demand" one or more routes between two nodes in a low power and lossy network.  This draft also proposes functionality that would enable RPL to provide these P2P mechanisms.</t></abstract>
