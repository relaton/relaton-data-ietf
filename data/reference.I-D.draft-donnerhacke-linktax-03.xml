<abstract><t>Links are omnipresent in the Internet to provide access to other resources.  There is no mechanism to express differences in law systems, access limitations, or arbitrary rules defined by the owner of the linked resource.  Therefore links do depend on and enforce a communist sharing ideology, which ignores the content owner rights.  Links may point to resources far away from the originating page, hiding this fact from the customer.  It takes the data transport services for free, internet transit providers on the way from the content source to the customers are not extra payed for this effort. In many cases, the remote company generates huge amount of money from the customers worldwide not shared with the transit providers.  In order to get the rights of all involved parties balanced, a new type of connection initiation is proposed: The Right.</t></abstract>
