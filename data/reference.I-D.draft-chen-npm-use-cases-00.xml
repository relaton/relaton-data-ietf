<abstract><t>As networks continue to scale, we need a coordinated effort for diagnosing control plane health issues in heterogeneous environments. Traditionally, operators developed internal solutions to address the identification and remediation of control plane health issues, but as networks increase in size, speed and dynamicity, new methods and techniques will be required.  This document highlights key network health issues, as well as network planning requirements, identified by leading network operators.  It also provides an overview of current art and techniques that are used, but highlights key deficiencies and areas for improvement.  This document proposes a unified management framework for coordinating diagnostics of control plane problems and optimization of network design.  Furthermore, it outlines requirements for collecting, storing and analyzing control plane data, to minimise or negate control plane problems that may significantly affect overall network performance and to optimize path/peering/policy planning for meeting application-specific demands.</t></abstract>
