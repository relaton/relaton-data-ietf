<abstract><t>This document describes "Zone-ID Free" functions that make end users free from using zone identifiers (Zone-ID) for IPv6 link- local addresses.  When users deal with IPv6 link-local addresses, it is thought that it is mandatory thing to specify accompanied Zone-IDs. For end users, however, it is troublesome and nuisance thing to do it. Because it is very hard for normal end users to find appropriate Zone-IDs for this purpose.  From another viewpoint, the usage of IPv6 link-local addresses accompanied with Zone-IDs is quite different from the traditional usage of global addresses. Therefore many problems related with Zone-ID are caused and new specifications are required to fix these problems.  This document explores and describes how "Zone-ID Free" functions work and how end users are released from using Zone-IDs when they deal with IPv6 link-local addresses.  The "Zone-ID Free" functions are upper compatible with the current usages of dealing with IPv6 link-local addresses and harmless to the existing communications.  In order to obtain appropriate Zone-ID information, a new technology "Zone-ID Learning" that issues multiple probes is introduced.</t></abstract>
