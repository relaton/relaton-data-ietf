<abstract><t>This document describes the INFO usage examples for network based mid-call service. Mid-call based services are for example, Call Transfer, Call Waiting, and Three-Way Calling. Other possible mid- call services are useful and important, even more in IP multimedia network. The cases described in SIP service examples (draft-ietf- sipping-service-examples-05) are Terminal-basis. Since the service procedures are fixed in the Terminal, the features are not extensible. This document propose network-based mid-call control mechanism with INFO and show examples that simple mid-call request (INFO) from the Terminal, the network application server provide various mid-call services by prompting user through the Media Server, according to the subscription information of the user.</t></abstract>
