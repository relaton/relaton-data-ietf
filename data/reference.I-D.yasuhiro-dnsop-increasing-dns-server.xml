<abstract><t>Currently, it is thought that the maximum number of DNS servers for a zone is 13. In fact, current root and some TLD zones have 13 DNS servers. But this is not enough for DNS stability and robustness especially root and/or TLD server, therefore, IP anycast [Hardie, 2002] is introduced on some root servers. This draft proposes an another approach for increasing of DNS server hosts without changing DNS protocol by using 'multiple-addresses per host' method. And this draft also considers what is the most suitable number of the IP addresses for one DNS server name.</t></abstract>
