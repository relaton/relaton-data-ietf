<abstract><t>This document is an attempt to classify different types of node in peer-to-peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP).  Four possible types of nodes in P2PSIP are discussed based on two characters: whether it offers overlay-routing services and whether it offers storage functions.  The behaviors of each type of nodes and their possible necessities are analyzed.  This document is dedicated to be a reference for clarifying some controversial terms in P2PSIP working group, such as "client", "low-function peer", etc.</t></abstract>
