<abstract><t>The International Standard Book Number, ISBN, is a widely used identifier for monographic publications.  Since 2001, there has been a URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespace for ISBNs.  The namespace registration was performed in RFC 3187 and applies to the ISBN as specified in the original ISO Standard 2108-1992.  To allow for further growth in use, the successor ISO Standard, ISO 2108-2005, has defined an expanded format for the ISBN, known as "ISBN-13".  This document replaces RFC 3187 and defines how both the old and new ISBN standard can be supported within the URN framework and the syntax for URNs defined in RFC 2141.  An updated namespace registration is included, which describes how both the old and the new ISBN format can share the same namespace.  Discussion  This draft version is the outcome of work started in 2008 and brought to the IETF as a contribution to a much larger effort to revise the basic URN RFCs, in order to bring them in alignment with the current URI Standard (STD 63, RFC 3986), ABNF, and IANA guidelines, and to establish a modern URN resolution system for bibliographic identifiers.  Until a more specific mailing list is established, comments are welcome on the urn-nid@ietf.org mailing list (or sent to the authors).</t></abstract>
