<abstract><t>The defining feature of a standard is that it be widely, preferably ubiquitously used.  The deployment strategies of previous protocol standardization efforts are compared and best practice suggested for application and infrastructure protocol deployment strategies are described.  Recommendations for enabling deployment of specific protocols and for future IETF working practices are made.  This draft is a generalization of the principles used to develop the deployment strategy for the Mathematical Mesh.  Many documents describing deployment considerations have been developed during the development of the Mesh and these have motivated many changes to the design during the course of development.  The Mesh is consciously and deliberately modeled on the same strategies that succeeded in the Web. Some of these strategies are well known:  Other parts of the Web strategy have not been widely discussed.  This paper presents some parts of the strategy most relevant to the IAB workshop program.  This document is also available online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-iab-deployment.html [1] .</t></abstract>
