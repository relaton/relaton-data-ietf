<abstract><t>This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity.  PRoPHET is a routing protocol for intermittently connected networks, where there is no guarantee that a fully connected path between source and destination exists at any time, rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messages between hosts.  These networks are examples of networks where the Delay-Tolerant Network architecture[1] is applicable.  The document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol specification.</t></abstract>
