<abstract><t>This document presents a list of tests that implementers of IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) compliant Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes should perform on their IPFIX Exporting Process and/or Collecting Process. This document has been created to help implementers test the functionality of their IPFIX Exporting Process and/or Collecting Process. The goal of these tests is to ensure that all important functions are covered by tests and thereby to gain a level of confidence in the Exporting Process and Collecting Process that allows the implementer to perform interoperability or plug tests with other IPFIX Exporting Processes and Collecting Processes.</t></abstract>
