<abstract><t>Transport network domains, including Optical Transport Network (OTN) and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks, are typically deployed based on a single vendor or technology platforms. They are often managed using proprietary interfaces to dedicated Element Management Systems (EMS), Network Management Systems (NMS) and increasingly Software Defined Network (SDN) controllers.  A well-defined open interface to each domain management system or controller is required for network operators to facilitate control automation and orchestrate end-to-end services across multi-domain networks. These functions may be enabled using standardized data models (e.g. YANG), and appropriate protocol (e.g., RESTCONF).  This document analyses the applicability of the YANG models being defined by the IETF (Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling (TEAS) and Common Control and Measurement Plane (CCAMP) WGs in particular) to support OTN single and multi-domain scenarios.</t></abstract>
