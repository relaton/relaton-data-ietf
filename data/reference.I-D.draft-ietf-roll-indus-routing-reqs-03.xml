<abstract><t>Wireless, low power field devices enable industrial users to significantly increase the amount of information collected and the number of control points that can be remotely managed.  The deployment of these wireless devices will significantly improve the productivity and safety of the plants while increasing the efficiency of the plant workers by extending the information set available from wired systems.  In an industrial environment, low power, high reliability, and easy installation and maintenance are mandatory qualities for wireless devices.  The aim of this document is to analyze the requirements for the routing protocol used for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN) in industrial environments.</t></abstract>
