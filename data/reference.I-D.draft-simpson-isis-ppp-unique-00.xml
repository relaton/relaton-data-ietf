<abstract><t>The IS-IS routing protocol (Intermediate System to Intermediate System, ISO 10589) requires unique System Identifiers at the link layer.  A common practice has been to use an existing IEEE 802 MAC link-layer interface identifier.  When no unique MAC is available, this document specifies automatic generation of identifiers.  It is fully interoperable with systems that do not support this extension.  Additionally, the extension automatically resolves conflicts between System Identifiers.
