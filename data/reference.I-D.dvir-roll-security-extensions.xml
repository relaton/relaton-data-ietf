<abstract><t>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of networks in which both the routers and their interconnects are constrained.  LLN routers typically operate with constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power).  LLN router supported traffic flows include point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to- point. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provides the mechanisms to support those traffic flows.  The currently available security services in RPL will not protect against a compromised internal node that can also construct and disseminate fake messages. In this document, a service is described that prevents an internal attacker from impersonating a Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph (DODAG) root.  Moreover, the establishment and maintenance of any cryptographic key is out of the scope of the current RPL proposal.  In this document a service that allows nodes to agree on local keys with their neighborhood is also presented.</t></abstract>
