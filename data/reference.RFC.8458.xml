<abstract><t>National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs) are used by national libraries and other organizations in order to identify resources in their collections.  NBNs are usually applied to resources that are not catered for by established (standard) identifier systems such as International Standard Book Number (ISBN).</t><t>A Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for NBNs was established in 2001 in RFC 3188.  Since then, a number of European national libraries have implemented URN:NBN-based systems.</t><t>This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be supported within the updated URN framework.  A revised namespace registration (version 4) compliant to RFC 8141 is included.</t></abstract>
