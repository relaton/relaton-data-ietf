<abstract><t>In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision was made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format to XML.  The high-level requirements for the format of RFCs were defined in RFC6949, "RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development." Several different publication formats will be rendered from that canonical XML, including HTML, PDF, TXT, and EPUB.  This draft documents the change in requirements and layout for the plain-text RFC publication format.</t></abstract>
