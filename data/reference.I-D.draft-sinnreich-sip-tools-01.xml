<abstract><t>This memo discusses the usage scenario of SIP where all the applications reside in the endpoints. This is an alternative to the current usage of SIP where the services reside in the network. The use of SIP where the applications reside in the endpoints is applicable to P2P SIP networks and also to client-server networks. Such an approach reduces the number of required SIP related standards (as by spring 2007) from roughly 100 to about 11. Successful IP communications must also include the relevant standards for NAT traversal, some of which are not directly related to SIP and also several standards for security. These standards are included in the simple usage scenario for SIP as well.</t></abstract>
