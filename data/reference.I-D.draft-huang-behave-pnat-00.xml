<abstract><t>Host based translation such as BIA, BIS could support conventional IPv4 applications talk with IPv6 applications in the dual stack network, and BIAbis and BISbis propose to extend this two solutions support IPv6 and IPv4 only network which consequently support IPv6 applications as well.  This document describes a mechanism called "PNAT" which could guarantee the IPv4 or IPv6 applications in the two hosts communicate with each other directly through host based translation technologies, or by together with a network translator such as NAT64.</t></abstract>
