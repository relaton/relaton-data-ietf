<abstract><t>OSPF (OSPFv2 and OSPFv3) is widely deployed link-state protocol in routing networks.  During the past decades, it has been operated and maintained through typical CLI, SNMP and NETCONF.  With the expansion and complication of modern networks, the necessity for rapid and dynamic control has been increased.  The I2RS is a standard-based interface which provides a programmatic way to achieve this goal.  This document specifies an OSPF yang data model for the I2RS interface to OSPF.  This model is based on the the I2RS OSPF informational model (draft-ietf-wu-ospf-info-model-00) which satisfies the requirements suggested by the I2RS use case requirements for the IGPs.  This yang data model can be used by I2RS client-agent protocol to program OSPF routing entities.</t></abstract>
