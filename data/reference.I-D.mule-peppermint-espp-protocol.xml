<abstract><t>This document defines a provisioning protocol for ENUM-SIP addressing servers. An ENUM-SIP addressing server is a host that acts as Lookup Function in session peering to determine the target domain of a given SIP request and it may also act as a Location Routing Function to develop the location of the SIP signaling entity in that target domain. This protocol allows SIP service providers to provision and manage session establishment data used by SIP network elements to route SIP sessions to the target destinations which may be served by the SIP service provider's own internal network or by a session peering partner.  The data provisioned into an ENUM-SIP addressing server is queried by SIP entities using ENUM or SIP.  This version of the protocol integrates comments received on the IETF peppermint and drinks mailing lists before July 2008.  This document is an Internet-Draft and the protocol it describes is subject to technical changes that may make this version incompatible with future versions defined in Internet-Drafts.  It is expected that the authors will continue to update this protocol based on the drinks working group requirements on the session establishment data.</t></abstract>
