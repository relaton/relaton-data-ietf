<abstract><t>An increasing number of SIP architectures implement multiple path routing (MPR), which is the providing of more than one path for a call to reach a destination user agent (UA).  To implement MPR well, the proxy which forks a request onto the redundant paths needs to be able to determine if a fork that failed reached the destination UA and was rejected by the UA (and so an alternate path should not be tried), or if the fork failed before reaching the UA (and so an alternate path should be attempted).  This document is to begin a discussion of strategies for making this determination.</t></abstract>
