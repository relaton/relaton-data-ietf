<abstract><t>Over its thirty-five year history Internet Mail has undergone significant changes in scale and complexity, as it has become a global infrastructure service.  The first standardized architecture for networked email specified little more than a simple split between the user world and the transmission world.  Core aspects of the service, such as the styles of mailbox address and basic message format, have remained remarkably constant.  However today's Internet Mail is marked by many independent operators, many different components for providing service to users and many others for performing message transfer.  Public discussion of the service often lacks common terminology and a common frame of reference for these components and their activities.  Having a common reference model and terminology makes a basic difference when talking about problems with the service, changes in policy, or enhancement to the service's functionality.  This document offers an enhanced Internet Mail architecture that targets description of the existing service, in order to facilitate clearer and more efficient technical, operations and policy discussions about email.</t></abstract>
