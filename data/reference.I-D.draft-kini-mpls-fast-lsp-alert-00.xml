<abstract><t>There are applications (e.g. fault-management, OAM) that need to alert LSRs along an LSP path. TTL expiry and GAL are currently defined mechanisms. An invocation of such a mechanism alerts a single LSR. When multiple LSRs along the LSP need to be alerted, multiple messages may have to be generated. Also, messages may have to be processed and forwarded hop-by-hop by the control plane. In fault recovery scenarios where multiple LSRs need to be alerted this increases the recovery time and hence the traffic loss. This document defines a simple and fast mechanism that allows all the LSRs along a LSP to be alerted with a single message.</t></abstract>
