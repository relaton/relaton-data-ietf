<abstract><t>This draft considers inter-carrier OAM requirements for supporting end-to-end OAM functionality and mechanisms development in a multi- operator environment. It attempts to summarize and discuss the already proposed OAM requirements addressed in IETF [RFC5706, RFC5860], ITU-T [Y.1710, Y.1730], MEF [MEFOAM] and IEEE [IEEE1, IEEE2] which were mainly proposed on a per transport technology basis, and introduce the need for a distinction and additional requirements for the inter-carrier OAM operations.</t></abstract>
