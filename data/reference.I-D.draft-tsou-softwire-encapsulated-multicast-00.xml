<abstract><t>Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transition scenarios, where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports one IP version, but the host and Network B support a different IP version.  Suppose that the host wishes to access a multicast group which is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document specifies an approach that combines stateful translation for signalling, encapsulation of multicast content moving between Network B and the host, and native multicast routing in Network A to provide the host with its desired access.</t></abstract>
