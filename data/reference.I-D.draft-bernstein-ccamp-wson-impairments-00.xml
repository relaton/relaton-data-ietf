<abstract><t>The operation of optical networks can require a level of detail in the characterization of network elements, subsystems, devices, and cabling not typically encountered with other networking technologies. In addition, these physical characteristics may be important to consider during typical day-to-day operations such as optical path establishment and connection monitoring, as well as during the network planning, installation, and turn-up phases. This document discusses how the definition and characterization of optical fiber, devices, subsystems, and network elements contained in various ITU-T recommendations can be combined with common control and measurement plane and path computation element technologies to support impairment aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in optical networks.</t></abstract>
