<abstract><t>A separate document [I-D:draft-taddei-smart-cless-introduction] (CLESS) attempts to establish the capabilities and limitations of endpoint-only security solutions and explore potential alternative approaches. That document discusses endpoints in general terms. It has been suggested that there are classes of endpoints that have different characteristics. Those classes may have completely different threat landscapes and the endpoints may have completely different security capabilities. In support of the work on CLESS, this document provides a taxonomy of endpoints that is intended to provide a foundation for further work on CLESS and research on approaches to providing endpoint security alternatives in a diverse group of settings.</t></abstract>
