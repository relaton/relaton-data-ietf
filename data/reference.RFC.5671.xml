<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.</t><t>Extensions to the MPLS and GMPLS signaling and routing protocols have been made in support of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).</t><t>This document examines the applicability of PCE to path computation for P2MP TE LSPs in MPLS and GMPLS networks.  It describes the motivation for using a PCE to compute these paths and examines which of the PCE architectural models are appropriate.  This memo provides  information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
