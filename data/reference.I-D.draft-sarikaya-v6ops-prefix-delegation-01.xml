<abstract><t>As interest on IPv6 deployment is increasing in cellular networks several migration issues are being raised and IPv6 prefix management is the one addressed in this document.  Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes, we address prefix management issues such as the access router offloading delegation and release tasks of the prefixes to a DHCPv6 server using DHCPv6 PD.  The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node from the DHCPv6 server. The access router may next assign an address to the mobile node, e.g. with a Router Advertisement message.  We also describe prefix management issues such as allocating variant IPv6 prefixes to the fixed nodes connected to the Internet with a cellular link.</t></abstract>
