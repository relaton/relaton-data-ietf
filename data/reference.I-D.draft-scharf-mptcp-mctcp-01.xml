<abstract><t>Multipath transport over potentially different paths can be realized by several coupled Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections. Multi-Connection TCP (MCTCP) transport aggregates multiple TCP connections between potentially different addresses into a single session that can be accessed by an application like a single TCP connection.  MCTCP encodes control information, as far as possible, in the payload of the TCP connections and therefore requires only minor changes in the TCP implementations, and it is transparent in the single-path case.  MCTCP is therefore proposed as a simple, modular, and extensible mechanism for multipath transport.</t></abstract>
