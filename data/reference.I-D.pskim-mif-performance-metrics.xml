<abstract><t>This draft proposes a measurement scheme of IP performance metrics for mobile networks with multiple interfaces in heterogeneous wireless networks. In the proposed scheme, mobile nodes (MNs) can get IP performance metrics irrespective of the presence or absence of measurement functionality. Since the multihomed mobile router (MMR) with heterogeneous wireless multiple interfaces measures IP performance metrics on behalf of the MNs inside the mobile network, the proposed scheme does not require MNs to be involved in measuring IP performance metrics. MNs can get measured IP performance metrics from the MMR using L3 messages. Therefore, the proposed scheme can reduce burden and power consumption of MNs with limited resource and battery power since MNs don't measure directly IP performance metrics. In addition, the proposed scheme can reduce considerably traffic overhead over wireless links on multiple measurement paths since signaling messages and injected testing traffic are reduced.</t></abstract>
