<abstract><t>The security extensions to the Domain Name System (DNSSEC) allow for integrity protection, whereby it is possible to make a determination of the verity of data returned from the Domain Name System in response to a query. Current operation of the Domain Name System also allows for the creation of multiple views of data, where the answer returned in response to a query is dependent on the origin of the query. Data integrity and the ability to return possibly conflicting values as in split-views may be construed to be mutually conflicting goals; but this apparent dichotomy is resolvable in practice through careful configuration. This document provides recommendations for configuring a manageable split-view DNSSEC environment in a representative enterprise network.</t></abstract>
