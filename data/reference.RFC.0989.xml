<abstract><t>This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the Internet community and    requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This RFC is the    outgrowth of a series of IAB Privacy Task Force meetings and of internal    working papers distributed for those meetings.  This RFC defines message    encipherment and authentication procedures, as the initial phase of an    effort to provide privacy enhancement services for electronic mail    transfer in the Internet. It is intended that the procedures defined    here be compatible with a wide range of key management approaches,    including both conventional (symmetric) and public-key (asymmetric)    approaches for encryption of data encrypting keys.  Use of conventional    cryptography for message text encryption and/or authentication is    anticipated.</t></abstract>
