<abstract><t>Building on already available security formats and message transports (like PGP/MIME for email), pretty Easy privacy (pEp) describes protocols to automatize operations (key management, key discovery, private key handling including peer-to-peer synchronization of private keys and other user data across devices) that have been seen to be barriers to deployment of end-to-end secure interpersonal messaging.  pEp also introduces "Trustwords" (instead of fingerprints) to verify communication peers and proposes a trust rating system to denote secure types of communications and signal the privacy level available on a per-user and per-message level.  In this document, the general design choices and principles of pEp are outlined.</t></abstract>
