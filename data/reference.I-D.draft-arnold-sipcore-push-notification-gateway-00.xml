<abstract><t>This document describes how a Push Notification Gateway (PNG) network element can be used to allow SIP User Agents (UA) to run on devices where background processing and monitoring is limited.  In these circumstances, it cannot be assumed that the SIP UA can regularly REGISTER with the network or be able to detect inbound messages.  A PNG stores details provided to it by the UA during registration to prompt a Push Notification Service (PNS) to generate a real-time notification for the UA to REGISTER with the network and therefore be available for inbound SIP messages.</t></abstract>
