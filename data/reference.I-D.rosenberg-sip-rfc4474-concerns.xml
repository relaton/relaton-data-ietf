<abstract><t>RFC 4474 defines a mechanism for secure identification of callers in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  This mechanism has been used as the foundation for some recent additional work, including connected party identification, anti-spam, and secure media. However, concerns have been raised about the applicability of RFC 4474 in real deployments and the actual level of security services it provides.  This document describes those concerns.</t></abstract>
