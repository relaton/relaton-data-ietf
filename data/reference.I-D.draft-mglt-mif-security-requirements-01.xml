<abstract><t>ISPs wants to take advantage of MIF Transport protocols like SCTP, MPTCP to enhance their End User's experience when the End User has been offloaded on WLAN.  In addition, WLAN are untrusted so ISPs MUST Secure at least some of their End Users's communications.  For various reasons IPsec is the protocol they choose to secure the communications.  Currently, IPsec is not adapted to Multiple Interfaces Environment.  IPsec can hardly be configured in a proper way which may result in breaking End Users' communications.  At least, it makes it very hard for the End Users to combine Security with MIF enhancements.  MOBIKE partly address the problem for a single Interface.  This draft provides the problem statement and defines the IPsec Security Requirements for MIF.</t></abstract>
