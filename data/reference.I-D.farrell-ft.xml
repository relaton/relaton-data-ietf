<abstract><t>This memo describes an optional, fast-track way to progress a working group document to IESG review.  It is provided as a process experiment as defined in RFC 3933 for use when working group chairs believe that there is running code that implements a working group Internet-Draft.  The motivation is to have the IETF process explicitly consider running code, consistent with the IETF's overall philosophy of running code and rough consensus.  In this process all of working group last call, IETF last call, and Area Director review are carried out in the same two week period. Only comments that meet IESG Discuss criteria need to be addressed during this stage, and authors are required to make any changes within two weeks.  This experiment will run for one year.</t></abstract>
