<abstract><t>This RFC actually is a request for comments.  The issue dealt with is    that of a naming registry update procedure, both as exists currently    and what could exist in the future.  None of the proposed solutions    are intended as standards at this time; rather it is hoped that a    general consensus will emerge as the appropriate solution, leaving    eventually to the adoption of standards.</t></abstract>
