<abstract><t>This specification defines an extension of the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) Protocol for asking the STUN server to relay packets towards a client. This extension, called Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN), is useful for elements behind NATs whose mapping behavior is address and port dependent. The extension purposefully restricts the ways in which the relayed address can be used. In particular, it prevents users from running general purpose servers from ports obtained from the STUN server.</t></abstract>
