<abstract><t>This text documents 'P-Charge-Info', an existing private Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) header (P-header) used to convey billing information about the party to be charged.  This P-Header is currently in production usage by a number of equipment vendors and carriers and this document is submitted to request the registration of this header with IANA. This P-Header may also be used in some situations to carry the ISUP Charge Number parameter for PSTN interconnection.  NOTE: This document has been in development since 2008 under the name draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info.  This -00 document is identical to draft-york-sipping-p-charge-info-15 except for edits to the text to indicate this is now for the DISPATCH working group.</t></abstract>
