<abstract><t>In some inter-AS and inter-area deployment scenarios for LSP Ping and Traceroute, a replying LSR may not have the available route to the initiator, and the Echo Reply message sent to the initiator would be discarded resulting in false negatives or complete failure of operation of LSP Ping and Traceroute.  This document describes extensions to LSP Ping mechanism to enable the replying LSR to have the capability to relay the echo response by a set of routable intermediate nodes to the initiator during the traceroute process in inter-AS and inter-area scenarios.</t></abstract>
