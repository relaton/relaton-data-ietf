<abstract><t>There is a need for applications using SIP to exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session establishment.  This information, known as call control UUI, is a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the session, and utilized by an application accepting the session.  This data is opaque to SIP and its function is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  Several approaches to transporting call control UUI in SIP have been proposed.  As networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency.  This document discusses three mechanisms to meet the requirements defined in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUI document.  A new SIP header field which bests meets these requirements is proposed.</t></abstract>
