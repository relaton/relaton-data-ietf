<abstract><t>Well-known issues with multicast have prevented the deployment of multicast in 802.11 [dot11], [mc-props], [mc-prob-stmt], and other local-area wireless environments.  IETF multicast experts have been meeting together to discuss these issues and provide IEEE updates. The mboned working group is chartered to receive regular reports on the current state of the deployment of multicast technology, create "practice and experience" documents that capture the experience of those who have deployed and are deploying various multicast technologies, and provide feedback to other relevant working groups. This document offers guidance on known limitations and problems with wireless multicast.  Also described are various multicast enhancement features that have been specified at IETF and IEEE 802 for wireless media, as well as some operational chioces that can be taken to improve the performace of the network.  Finally, some recommendations are provided about the usage and combination of these features and operational choices.</t></abstract>
