<abstract><t>This document describes SPIRITS protocol. The purpose of the SPIRITS protocol is to support services that originate in the cellular or wireline Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and necessitate the interactions between the PSTN and the Internet. On the PSTN side, the SPIRITS services are most often initiated from the Intelligent Network (IN) entities. Internet Call Waiting, Internet Caller-ID Delivery, are examples of SPIRITS services; as are location-based services on the cellular network. The protocol is to define the building blocks from which many other services can be built.</t></abstract>
