<abstract><t>This document proposes an experimental set of alternative decision-making processes for use in IETF working groups. There are a small number of cases in IETF working groups in which the group has come to consensus that a particular decision must be made but cannot come to consensus on the decision itself. This document describes alternative mechanisms which can be used to come to a decision in those cases. This is not meant to provide an exhaustive list, but to provide a known set of tools which can be used when required.</t></abstract>
