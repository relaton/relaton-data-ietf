<abstract><t>A protocol design flaw in the TLS renegotiation handshake leaves all currently implemented protocol version of TLS (SSLv3 to TLSv1.2) vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks where the attacker can establish a TLS session with a server, send crafted application data of his choice to the server and then proxy an unsuspecting client's TLS handshake into the TLS renegotiation handshake of the server. The application on top of TLS sees the data injected by the attacker and the data sent by the client as a single data stream and assumes that an authentication during the TLS renegotiation handshake or contained in the application data from the client applies to the entire data stream received through the TLS-protected communication channel.  This document describes a protocol change for all protocol versions of TLS plus SSLv3 that will fix this vulnerability for all communication between updated TLS clients and updated TLS servers.  IMPORTANT: _All_ existing implementations of TLS and SSLv3 will have to be updated, including those that have TLS renegotiation disabled and even those that do not implement TLS renegotiation at all!</t></abstract>
