<abstract><t>Application protocols that make use of Unicode code points in protocol strings need to prepare such strings in order to perform comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or authorization).  In general, this problem has been labeled the "preparation and comparison of internationalized strings" or "PRECIS".  This document defines a framework that enables application protocols to prepare various classes of strings in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode code points.  Because this framework does not depend on large tables of Unicode code points as in stringprep (RFC 3454), it is more agile with regard to changes in the underlying Unicode database and thus provides improved flexibility to application protocols.  A specification that reuses this framework either can directly use the base string classes defined in this document or can subclass the base string classes as needed.  This framework uses an approach similar to that of the revised internationalized domain names in applications (IDNA) technology (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893, RFC 5894) and thus adheres to the high-level design goals described in RFC 4690, albeit for non-IDNA technologies.  This document obsoletes RFC 3454.</t></abstract>
