<abstract><t>This document describes Cogny protocol that is a SOAP-based protocol for peer-to-peer content sharing systems. Unlike general purpose peer-to-peer protocols such as JXTA protocol, Cogny protocol is specialized to support centralized peer-to-peer content sharing systems. So it is much simpler and easier to implement than JXTA protocol. Because Cogny protocol is specialized to content sharing systems, it defines application layer functions necessary to them. One of them is a content transfer protocol that keeps consistency of content. Cogny protocol defines encryption method for it. Another is efficient full-text search. Cogny protocol defines a cache method for full-text search.</t></abstract>
