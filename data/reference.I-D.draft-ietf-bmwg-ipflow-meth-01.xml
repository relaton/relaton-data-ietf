<abstract><t>This document provides methodology and framework for quantifying performance impact of monitoring of IP flows on a network device and export of this information to a collector. It identifies the rate at which the IP flows are created, expired and successfully exported as a new performance metric in combination with traditional throughput.  The metric is only applicable to the devices compliant with the Architecture for IP Flow Information Export [RFC5470].</t></abstract>
