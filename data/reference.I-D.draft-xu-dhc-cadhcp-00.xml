<abstract><t>This document defines a technique that can provide both entity authentication and message authentication based on certificates. This protocol combines existing options, such as the delay authentication mechanism in [RFC3118] and the user authentication protocol option defined in [RFC2485].  The goal of this specification is to define methods for certificates to protect the integrity of DHCP messages and close the gaps of the existing delay authentication mechanism. In order to meet these goals, we use the asymmetrical cryptograph protection and some options about authentication that have been defined in other specifications.</t></abstract>
