<abstract><t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.  This document specifies a mechanism that will allow an end user to establish the trusted key state of the resolvers that handle the user's DNS queries.  This allows users to discover the trusted key state used by their DNS resolution service.</t></abstract>
