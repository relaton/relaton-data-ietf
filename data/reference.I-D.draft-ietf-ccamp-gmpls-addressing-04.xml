<abstract><t>This document explains and clarifies the use of addresses in Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. The aim of this document is to facilitate and ensure better interworking of GMPLS-capable Label Switching Routers (LSRs) based on experience gained in deployments and interoperability testing and proper interpretation of published RFCs. The document recommends a proper approach for the interpretation and choice of address and identifier fields within GMPLS protocols and references specific control plane usage models. It also examines some common GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling message processing issues and recommends solutions. Finally, it discusses how to handle IPv6 sources and destinations in the MPLS and GMPLS TE (Traffic Engineering) MIB (Management Information Base) modules.</t></abstract>
