<abstract><t>Whenever the IETF decides to enter into a liaison relationship with another organization, such as a Standards Development Organization (SDO), a consortium, or an industrial forum, a liaison manager is appointed.  The procedures used by the IAB to establish and maintain liaison relationships between the IETF and other organizations are described in RFC 4052.  This document expands on the role of liaison managers and liaison representatives, giving guidelines on their mandate and the expectations, tasks, and responsibilities placed on them.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
