<abstract><t>This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC) Scheme for the one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) parity codes and its application to reliable delivery of media streams in the context of FEC Framework.  The 1-D and 2-D parity codes are systematic codes, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the source symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source flow.  The 1-D and 2-D parity codes offer a good protection against random and bursty packet losses at a cost of decent complexity.  This document also specifies an RTP payload format for the FEC that is generated by the 1-D and 2-D parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP.  The FEC defined in this document is not backward compatible with RFC 5109.</t></abstract>
