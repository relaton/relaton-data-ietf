<abstract><t>A new proposal is presented for speeding up the acquisition by the MAG of the MN's active multicast subscription information, in order to accelerate the multicast delivery to the MN during handover. To do that, an extension of the current PMIPv6 protocol is required. The solution described in this memo is not only applicable to the base multicast solution, but also it can be applied to other solutions envisioned as possible architectural evolutions of it. Furthermore, it is also independent of the role played by the MAG within the multicast metwork (either acting as MLD proxy or multicast router).</t></abstract>
