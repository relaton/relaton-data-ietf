<abstract><t>Mobile IPv4 is a standard mobility protocol that enables IPv4 device to roam between networks. The mobile device has the Mobile IP function to signal its location to the routing anchor, known as the Home Agent. However, there are many IPv4 devices without such capability due to various reasons. This document describes WiMAX Forum and 3GPP2 solution for the base Proxy Mobile IPv4 function which enables another entity to provide mobility support on behalf of an unaltered and mobility-unaware IPv4 device.</t></abstract>
