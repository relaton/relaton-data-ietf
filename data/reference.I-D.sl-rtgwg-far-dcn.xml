<abstract><t>This document proposes a generic routing method and protocol for a regular data center network, named as Fault-Avoidance Routing (FAR) protocol.  FAR protocol provides a generic routing method for all types of regular topology network architectures that are proposed for large-scale cloud-based data centers over the past few years.  FAR protocol is well designed to fully leverage the regularity in the topology and compute its routing table in a concise manner.  Fat-tree is taken as an example architecture to illustrate how FAR protocol can be applied in real operational scenarios.</t></abstract>
