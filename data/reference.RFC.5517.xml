<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism to achieve device isolation through the application of special Layer 2 forwarding constraints. Such a mechanism allows end devices to share the same IP subnet while being Layer 2 isolated, which in turn allows network designers to employ larger subnets and so reduce the address management overhead.</t><t>Some of the numerous deployment scenarios of the aforementioned mechanism (which range from data center designs to Ethernet-to-the-home-basement networks) are mentioned in the following text to exemplify the mechanism's possible usages; however, this document is not intended to cover all such deployment scenarios nor delve into their details.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it  is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
