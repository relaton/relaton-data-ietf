<abstract><t>As the demand for high-performance mail delivery agents increases, it becomes apparent that single-machine solutions are inadequate to the task, both because of capacity limits and that the failure of the single machine means a loss of mail delivery for all users.  It is preferable to allow many machines to share the responsibility of mail delivery.  The Mailbox Update (MUPDATE) protocol allows a group of Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (POP3) servers to function with a unified mailbox namespace.  This document is intended to serve as a reference guide to that protocol.</t></abstract>
