<abstract><t>Many HTTP servers host content from several origins.  HTTP/2 [RFC7540] permits clients to reuse an existing HTTP connection to a server provided that certain conditions are satisfied.  One of these conditions is the inclusion of the secondary origin in the certificate provided during the TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] handshake.  In many cases, origins will wish to maintain separate certificates for different origins but still desire the benefits of a shared HTTP connection.  This draft describes how frames which were defined to transfer client certificates might be used to provide additional server certificates as well.</t></abstract>
