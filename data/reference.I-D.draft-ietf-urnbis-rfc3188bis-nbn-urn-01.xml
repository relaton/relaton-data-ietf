<abstract><t>National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are widely used by the national libraries and other organizations in order to identify various resources such as digitized monographs and monographs pre-dating the emergence of the ISBN system.  Generally, NBNs may be applied to all kinds of resources that do not have an established (standard) identifier system of their own.  A URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespace for NBNs was established in 2001, and since then, tens of millions of unique URN:NBNs have been assigned.  The namespace registration was performed in RFC 3188 and applied to the NBNs in use at that point.  No URN:NBN resolution services existed at the time when that RFC was written.  Since then, national libraries in several countries including Finland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands have established these services.  This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be supported within the updated URN framework.  A revised namespace registration (version 4) is included.</t></abstract>
