<abstract><t>For Internet-centric usage, the number of SIP related standards for presence, IM and audio/video communications can be reduced by using only the rendezvous and session initiation capabilities of SIP. Such 'simple SIP' implies (1) using SIP without network based features and (2) without emulating the telephone network. Rich applications, including telephony features can however be implemented in the endpoints. This approach for SIP reduces the number of SIP standards to comply with, currently from roughly 100 to about 9. Additional application examples and references for NAT traversal and for security are also provided.</t></abstract>
