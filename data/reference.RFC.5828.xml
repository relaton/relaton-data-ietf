<abstract><t>There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities of Ethernet switches and Ethernet forwarding models.  As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is rapidly expanding into &quot;transport networks&quot; that previously were the domain of other technologies such as Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).  This document defines an architecture and framework for a Generalized- MPLS-based control plane for Ethernet in this &quot;transport network&quot; capacity.   GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies.  Some additional extensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed, and this document provides a framework for these extensions.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
