<abstract><t>This defines the information model for the Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) standards.  The working group faces a set of complex issues when trying to define an information model that complicates this effort:  o  There are many standards in the SACM space which are not interoperable  o  There exists an extremely large and diverse set of data types which are desirable to exchange  o  Many data types depend on the operating systems from which they are collected; making a universal typing harder  o  A goal of SACM is to cover a diverse set of system types  These complex needs create a information model which is difficult to unify within the environment.  Instead, this information model design is focused on minimum needed functionality with the desire to include a type system design into the information model allowing for easy expandability.  It is envisioned that this information model will serve the following purposes:  o  Enough well specified elements in order to exchange key data fields between systems  o  Sufficient typing system to expand key fields over time and use of a registry to standardize common expansions  o  Meta information such that compplete information exchange using various other formats understood by all parties can be used as needed to exchange complete records on demand  o  Sufficient action verbs defined to allow orchestration between various systems to allow unified control of federated components</t></abstract>
