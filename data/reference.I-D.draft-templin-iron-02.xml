<abstract><t>The Internet routing system is experiencing a growth profile that has led many to express concerns for unsustainable routing scaling. Operational practices such as increased use of multihoming with IPv4 Provider-Independent (PI) addressing are resulting in more and more fine-grained prefixes injected into the routing system from more and more end user networks.  Furthermore, depletion of the remaining public IPv4 address space has raised concerns for both increased deaggregation (leading to yet further routing scaling) and an impending address space runout scenario.  At the same time, the IPv6 routing system is finally beginning to see significant growth in IPv6 Provider-Aggregated (PA) prefixes but there does not seem to be a solution on the near term horizon for IPv6 PI addressing.  Since the Internet must continue to support escalating growth due to increasing demand, it is clear that current mechanisms and operational practices are reaching a tipping point where something must be done.  This document proposes an Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) for supporting sustainable growth through PI addressing while requiring no changes to end systems and no changes to the existing routing system.</t></abstract>
