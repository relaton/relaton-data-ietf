<abstract><t>The Internet continues to grow beyond the capabilities of IPv4.  An expansion in the address space is clearly required.  With its increase in the number of available prefixes and addresses in a subnet, and improvements in address management, IPv6 is the only real option on the table.  Yet, IPv6 deployment requires some effort, resources, and expertise.  The availability of many different deployment models is one reason why expertise is required.  This document discusses the IPv6 deployment models and migration tools, and recommends ones that have been found to work well in operational networks in many common situations.</t></abstract>
