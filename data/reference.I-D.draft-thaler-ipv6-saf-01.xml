<abstract><t>There are various recent proposals that would result in IPv6 translation becoming permanent.  RFC 3424 discusses UNilateral Self- Address Fixing (UNSAF) mechanisms which are required for applications to work with most translation schemes, points out a number of problems with them, and requires an exit strategy for any UNSAF mechanism.  This document discusses an alternative to UNSAF mechanisms should IPv6 translation become permanent.</t></abstract>
