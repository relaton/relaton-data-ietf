<abstract><t>As one of well-known link-state protocols, OSPF has been widely used in the routing of intra domain networks.  During the past decades, it has been deployed with the help of typical interfaces such as CLI, SNMP and NETCONF.  As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the necessity for rapid and dynamic control has been increased.  The I2RS is a standard-based interface which provides a programmatic way to achieve this goal.  This document specifies an information model for the OSPF protocol to facilitate the definition of a standardized data model, which can be used to define interfaces to the OSPF from an entity that may even be external to the routing system.  Based on standardized data model and interfaces, use cases of IGP protocols defined by I2RS-WG can be supported.</t></abstract>
