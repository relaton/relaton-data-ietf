<abstract><t>Information Services are services whereby information is provided in response to user requests, and may include involvement of a human or automated agent. A popular existing Information Service is Directory Assistance (DA). Moving ahead, Information Services providers envision exciting multimedia services that support simultaneous voice and data interactions with full operator backup at any time during the call. Information Services providers are planning to migrate to SIP based platforms, which will enable such advanced services, while continuing to support traditional DA services. Operator Services are traditional PSTN services which often involve providing human or automated assistance to a caller, and often require the specialized capabilities traditionally provided by an operator services switch. Market and/or regulatory factors in some jurisdictions dictate that some subset of Operator Services continue to be provided going forward. This document aims to identify how Operator and Information Services can be implemented using existing or currently proposed SIP mechanisms, and to provide a set of Best Current Practices to facilitate interoperability.</t></abstract>
