<abstract><t>Extensions are proposed to NFS version 4 which enable it to support long-lived sessions, endpoint management, and operation atop a variety of RPC transports, including TCP and RDMA. These extensions enable support for reliably implemented client response caching by NFSv4 servers, enhanced security, multipathing and trunking of transport connections. These extensions provide identical benefits over both TCP and RDMA connection types.</t></abstract>
