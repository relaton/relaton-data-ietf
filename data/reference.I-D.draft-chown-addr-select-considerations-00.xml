<abstract><t>Through operational experience of IPv6 Default Address Selection (RFC3484) [1] implementations, it appears that a requirement has arisen for hosts and networks to be able to have their policies for address selection updated.  This text discusses considerations for such policy changes, e.g. examples of cases where a change of policy is required, and the likely frequency of such policy changes.  This text also includes some discussion on the need to also update RFC3484, where default policies are currently defined.</t></abstract>
