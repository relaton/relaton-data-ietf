<abstract><t>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. The requesting router then acts as a router between the downstream- attached hosts and the upstream provider network.  The router could also act as a host under the weak end system model, and otherwise behaves as a standard router.  This document considers the case when the "requesting router" is actually a host, and receives a prefix that it can use for multi-addressing purposes.  The host does not connect any downstream-attached networks, and uses the prefix solely for its own multi-addressing purposes.</t></abstract>
