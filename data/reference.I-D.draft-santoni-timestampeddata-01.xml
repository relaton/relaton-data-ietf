<abstract><t>This document describes a syntax which can be used to bind a generic document (or any set of data, not necessarily protected by means of cryptographic techniques) to one or more time-stamp tokens obtained for that document, where "time-stamp token" has the meaning defined in [TSP]. Additional types of temporal evidence are also supported.</t></abstract>
