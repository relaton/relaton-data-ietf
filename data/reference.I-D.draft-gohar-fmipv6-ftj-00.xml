<abstract><t>This draft describes a fast handover mechanism to provide seamless multicast services in the wireless/mobile networks based on the Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6). When a mobile node (MN) moves from one access router to another, it may encounter data loss. In the tree joining case of the existing scheme, there is a problem of buffer overflow during the packet forwarding from Previous Access Router (PAR) to New Access Router (NAR), in which many packet losses may occur due to the buffer overflow.  In order to reduce this buffer overflow and the concerned packet losses, we propose a new scheme of a fast tree join for seamless multicast handover, which allows the NAR to join the multicast tree before the FMIPv6 handover is completed. In the proposed scheme, we consider the two specific cases: 1) the short tree joining time, in which no packet forwarding will be required and thus NAR can receive the multicast data from an upstream multicast router before the FMIPv6 handover is completed, 2) the long tree joining time, in which the packet forwarding will be required and thus NAR will receive the multicast data after the FMIPv6 handover.</t></abstract>
