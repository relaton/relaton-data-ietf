<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism for link-state routing protocols to prevent a subset of transient loops during topology changes.  It introduces a two-step convergence by introducing a delay between the network wide convergence and the node advertising the failure.  As the network wide convergence is delayed in case of down events, this mechanism can be used for planned maintenance or for unplanned outage provided a fast reroute mechanism is used in conjunction to convert a failure into a less urgent topology change.  Simulation using real network topologies and costs, with pathological convergence behaviour, have been performed.  While the proposed mechanism does not provide a complete solution, it is simple and it solves an interesting fraction of the transient loops in the analyzed SP topologies.</t></abstract>
