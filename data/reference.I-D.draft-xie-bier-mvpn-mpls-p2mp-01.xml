<abstract><t>The MVPN specifications allow the use of several different kinds of P-tunnel technology, such as mLDP P2MP, RSVP-TE P2MP and PIM SSM.  It is common for such a P-tunnel having a multicast-specific path.  Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific BIER header.  [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn] delivers a solution of MVPN using SPF based BIER defined in [RFC8279].  It can not, however, support a multicast- specific path well, something common in legacy MVPN deployment. [RFC8279] provides a solution to support mid nodes without BIER- capability.  It can not, however, support deployment on a network that has edge nodes without BIER-capability, which is common in some SP-networks.  This document introduces a seamless transition mechanism from legacy MVPN to MVPN using P2MP based BIER while preserving existing features such as multicast-specific PATH and Live-Live protection.  It also introduces a seamless Live-Live protection mechanism by re-using the Entropy field of the BIER header, and two methods to deploy BIER when edge nodes and/or mid nodes don't have BIER-capability.</t></abstract>
