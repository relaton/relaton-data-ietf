<abstract><t>This document defines the framework for Centralized Conferencing. The framework allows participants using various call signaling protocols, such as SIP, H.323, Jabber and PSTN, to exchange media in a centralized unicast conference. The Centralized Conferencing Framework defines logical entities and naming conventions, along with a conferencing data model. The framework also outlines a set of conferencing protocols, which are complementary to the call signaling protocols, for building advanced conferencing applications. The framework binds all the defined components together for the benefit of builders of conferencing systems.</t></abstract>
