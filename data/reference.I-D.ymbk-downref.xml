<abstract><t>IETF procedures generally require that a standards track RFC may not have a normative reference to a document at a lower standards level. For example a standards track document may not have a normative reference to an informational RFC. There are needs for exceptions to this rule, often caused by the IETF using informational RFCs to describe non-IETF standards, or IETF-specific modes of use of such standards. This document clarifies the procedure used in these circumstances.</t></abstract>
