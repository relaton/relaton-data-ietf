<abstract><t>This draft proposes a modification to draft-lawrence-dispatch-sipforum-provider-alias (PAN).  The PAN draft proposes a mechanism for a phone to take a short numeric identifier that identifies a phone service provider and look it up in DNS to find the address of the configuration server for that service provider.  The problem with PAN is that it requires a specific organization, sipforum.org, to become a registrar for the PAN.  This will add signifiant cost to obtaining them as the expected quantity of PAN is low.  This draft proposes a minor modification to the PAN draft. Instead of using the sipforum as a new registrar, why not just use the registrars that already exist for DNS names.  This ensure a long term stable unique allocation of PAN with the advantages of not having the IETF allocating a monopoly to one particular organization.</t></abstract>
