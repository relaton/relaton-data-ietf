<abstract><t>Re-establishment of QoS after a Mobile Node handover must be done as quickly as possible in order to reduce degradation or interruption of QoS. It is specifically useful if real-time applications are used. We propose a Semi-Proactive procedure for QoS re-establisment that also avoids waste of resources. Moreover, we propose a new point of buffering for the packets destined to the Mobile Node during the handover. This is useful when QoS is required for these packets.</t></abstract>
