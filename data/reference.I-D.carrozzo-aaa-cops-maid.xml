<abstract><t>This specification defines some extensions to the COPS protocol under the COPS-MAID client type to be used for the SP Control Plane procedures in a Multimedia Telephony Service (MTS) context. The reference SP network infrastructure is assumed to be based on MPLS/Diffserv Control and Data Planes. The proposed architecture is defined signalling independent because it is able to uphold different signalling protocols used by the MTS-enabled terminals (e.g. SIP, H.323, H.248-Megaco, MGCP, etc.) with a common approach. The overall specification relies on the identification of a common and generalized semantic for the service requests (policy &amp; CAC), which will encapsulate the client-specific information in a common format besides of the specific protocol (e.g. SIP, H.323, etc.). By means of this generalized architecture it is possible to reduce the complexity of the SP Control Plane architecture.</t></abstract>
