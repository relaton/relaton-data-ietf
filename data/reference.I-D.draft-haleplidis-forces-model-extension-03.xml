<abstract><t>Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly.  More specifically, the model describes the logical functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are or can be interconnected.  RFC5812 has been around for two years and experience in its use has shown room for small extensions without a need to alter the protocol while retaining backward compatibility with older xml libraries. This document extends the model to allow complex datatypes for metadata, optional default values for datatypes and optional access types for structures.  The document also introduces two new features, bitmap as a new datatype and a new event condition BecomesEqualTo.</t></abstract>
