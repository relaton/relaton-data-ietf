<abstract><t>The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-called DNS-based malware protection services deployed today by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), DNS Application Service Providers (ASPs), and other organizations providing so-called DNS-based malware protection services via their recursive DNS services, as well as to describe the recommended practices regarding such systems.  This document specifically and narrowly addresses those cases where DNS Redirect is being utilized to provide a service for end users which blocks domains hosting malicious software.</t></abstract>
