<abstract><t>The increasing deployment of both, IP multicast and mobility, rises the problem of delivering  IPv6 multicast traffic to mobile nodes. This document proposes an approach to the problem, named Decentralized Mobile Multicast, that combines tunnelling and dynamic subscription to the multicast groups. The proposed solution aims to reduce handover time, and to diminish the overhead produced by multicast subscriptions. As a consequence of the decentralized selection of multicast routers, a single point of failure is eliminated.</t></abstract>
