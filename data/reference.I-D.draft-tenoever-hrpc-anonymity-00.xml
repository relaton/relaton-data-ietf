<abstract><t>Anonymity is less discussed topic in the IETF than for instance security [RFC3552] or privacy [RFC6973].  This can be attributed to the fact anonymity is a hard technical problem or that anonymizing user data is not of specific market interest.  It remains a fact that 'most internet users would like to be anonymous online at least occasionally' [Pew].  This document aims to break down the different meanings and implications of anonymity on a mediated computer network.</t></abstract>
