<abstract><t>The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable carrier-grade packet transport.  This document discusses and specifies the P2MP framework primarily related to OAM and related management in MPLS-TP networks. This document mainly refers to RFC5654 and RFC6371. The main focus is on the details that are not covered or not clarified in relevant RFCs such as RFC5654, RFC5860, RFC5921, RFC5951, RFC6371, and draft-mpls- tp-p2mp-framework.  Note: This I-D was made and updated including the discussions in ITU-T SG15, which were described in Liaison Statements such as (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1235/)  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</t></abstract>
