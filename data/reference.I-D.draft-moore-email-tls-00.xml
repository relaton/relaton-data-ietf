<abstract><t>This memo requires support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) in all electronic mail user agents (MUAs) and the servers with which they communicate when using standard protocols, including Interactive Message Access Protocol (IMAP), Post Office Protocol (POP) and the variant of the Simple Message Transfer Protocol (SMTP) used in message submission.  It also requires support for TLS in mail protocol servers provided by electronic mail service providers, and encourages mail service providers to migrate to requiring TLS for all interaction with their servers.  In addition, this memo details specific recommendations for implementation and use of TLS with electronic mail protocols used in interactions between MUAs and mail service providers.  Use of TLS with SMTP for message relaying is described in a separate document, and not in scope for this document.  The recommendations in this memo do not replace the functionality of, and are not intended as a substitute for, end-to-end encryption of electronic mail.</t></abstract>
