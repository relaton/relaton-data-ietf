<abstract><t>This document defines the concept of an "origin," which is used by web browsers to isolate content retrieved from different parties. The origin concept is defined by a "same-origin" relation and a serialization algorithm.  This document also defines an HTTP Origin header, which a user agent can use to describe the security contexts that caused the user agent to initiate an HTTP request.  HTTP servers can use the Origin header to mitigate against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.</t></abstract>
