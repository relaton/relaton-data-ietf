<abstract><t>Privacy is an important issue for many governments [eurolaw] and users where its importance becomes more evident every day. Nodes might change their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked by attackers and which also results in the prevention of information being leaked from their nodes. In IPv6 networks there is currently one solution for maintaining privacy for nodes when IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC 4662) is used. Unfortunately this solution, i.e., Privacy Extension (RFC 4941), has some problems, such as not generating a new Interface ID (IID) after changing the router prefix. The RFC also gives no explanation as to how to use CGA in its randomizing solution. The purpose of this document is to address these issues and to update the current RFC.</t></abstract>
