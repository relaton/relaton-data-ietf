<abstract><t>This document describes behavior of signalling intermediaries in Real-Time Communication (RTC) deployments, sometimes referred to as Session Border Controllers (SBCs), when performing Hosted NAT Traversal (HNT).  HNT is a set of mechanisms, such as media relaying and latching, that such intermediaries use to enable other RTC devices behind NATs to communicate with each other.  This document is non-normative, and is only written to explain HNT in order to provide a reference to the IETF community, as well as an informative description to manufacturers, and users.  Latching, which is one of the components of the HNT components, has a number of security issues covered here.  Because of those, the IETF advises against use of this mechanism over the Internet and recommends other solutions such as the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol.</t></abstract>
