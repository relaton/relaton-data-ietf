<abstract><t>This draft specifies a set of Policy Rule Classes (PRC) for the enforcement of an IP forwarding policy by network devices. Instances of such classes reside in a virtual information store, which is called the IP Forwarding Policy Information Base (PIB). The corresponding IP forwarding policy provisioning data are intended for use by a COPS-PR TE Client-Type, and they complement the PRC classes that have been defined in the Framework PIB.</t></abstract>
