<abstract><t>There is widespread interest in using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to enable asynchronous or server-initiated communication from a server to a client as well as from a client to a server.  This document describes the known issues and the best practices related to the use of HTTP, as it exists today, to enable such "bidirectional HTTP".  The two existing mechanisms, called "HTTP long polling" and "HTTP streaming" are described.</t></abstract>
