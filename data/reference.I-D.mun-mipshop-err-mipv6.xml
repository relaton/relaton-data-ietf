<abstract><t>IETF published Fast Handovers in Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) for efficient mobility management. FMIPv6 has no solutions to protect binding update messages. Previous researches have mainly concentrated on using AAA, public certificates or cryptographic algorithms for authentication of FMIPv6. However the approaches need a particular infrastructure or heavy processing cost to authenticate binding updates in FMIPv6. Extended Return Routability provides authentication for FMIPv6 without infrastructure and costly cryptographic algorithms. Also it can be used for various existing handover protocol in MIPv6 network.</t></abstract>
