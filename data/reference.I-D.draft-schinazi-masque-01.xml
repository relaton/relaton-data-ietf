<abstract><t>This document describes MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate over QUIC Encryption).  MASQUE is a mechanism that allows co-locating and obfuscating networking applications behind an HTTPS web server. The currently prevalent use-case is to allow running a proxy or VPN server that is indistinguishable from an HTTPS server to any unauthenticated observer.  We do not expect major providers and CDNs to deploy this behind their main TLS certificate, as they are not willing to take the risk of getting blocked, as shown when domain fronting was blocked.  An expected use would be for individuals to enable this behind their personal websites via easy to configure open-source software.  This document is a straw-man proposal.  It does not contain enough details to implement the protocol, and is currently intended to spark discussions on the approach it is taking.  Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF mailing list masque@ietf.org [1] or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts [2].</t></abstract>
