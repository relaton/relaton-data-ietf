<abstract><t>Today's mobility management schemes make use of a hierarchy of tunnels from a relatively fixed anchor point, through one or more intermediate nodes, to reach the MN's current point of attachment. These schemes suffer from poor performance, scalability, and failure modes due to the centralization and statefulness of the anchor point(s).  The dmm (Distributed Mobility Management) working group is currently chartered to investigate alternative solutions that will provide greater performance, scalability, and robustness through the distribution of mobility anchors.  This document is an input to the dmm discussion.  It outlines a problem statement for the existing mobility management techniques and goes on to propose (high-level) solutions to two of the most vexing problems: MN authentication and mobility management in a fully distributed, flat (non-hierarchical) access network.  These two aspects are often treated separately in a layered architecture, but we argue there are important advantages to considering how these two functions can work in tandem to provide a simple and robust framework for the design of a wireless Internet Service Provider network.</t></abstract>
