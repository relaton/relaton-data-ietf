<abstract><t>Future networks that support advanced services, such as those enabled by 5G mobile networks, envision a set of overlay networks each with different performance and scaling properties.  These overlays are known as network slices and are realized over a common underlay network.  In the context of IETF technologies, they are known as IETF network slices.</t><t> In order to support IETF network slicing, as well as to offer enhanced VPN services in general, it is necessary to define a mechanism by which specific resources (links and/or nodes) of an underlay network can be used by a specific network slice, VPN, or set of VPNs.  This document sets out such a mechanism for use in Segment Routing networks.</t></abstract>
