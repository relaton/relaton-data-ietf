<abstract><t>This document specifies an extension to the messages defined in the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF) designed to allow intermediate node to suppress the feedback implosion from the receivers.  One of examples for feedback implosion is utilizing RTCP NACK to request retransmission of the missing packets which may result in NACK storm targeting to the same media sender.  This issue can be addressed to define one new RTCP message, which is referred to as the Feedback Storm Suppression receiver report and carries the information regarding feedback suppression early indication events to the receiver before the receiver detects an original packet loss and all the packet loss repair methods are applied.  By using feedback Suppression message together with RTCP based feedback message, the delay for the receiver to recover from the packet loss can be reduced and the risk of increasing network congestion can be mitigated or diminished.  This document also registers a new RTCP receiver report for Feedback Storm Suppression.</t></abstract>
