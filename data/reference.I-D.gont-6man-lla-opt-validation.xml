<abstract><t>This memo documents two scenarios in which an on-link attacker emits a crafted IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packet that poisons its victim's neighbor cache.  In the first scenario, the attacker causes a victim to map a local IPv6 address to a local router's own link- layer address.  In the second scenario, the attacker causes the victim to map a unicast IP address to a link layer broadcast address. In both scenarios, the attacker can exploit the poisoned neighbor cache to perform a subsequent forwording-loop attack, thus potentially causing a Denial of Service.  Finally, this memo specifies simple validations that the recipient of an ND message can execute in order to protect itself against the above-mentioned threats.</t></abstract>
