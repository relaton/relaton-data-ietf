<abstract><t>The National Emergency Number Association (NENA)'s mission is to foster the technological advancement, availability, and implementation of a universal emergency telephone number system in North America. NENA has an active effort to develop a new architecture for emergency call handling known as 'i3' being developed in its Long Term Definition working group. The following requirements are a subset of the requirements of the i3 work which relate to ecrit work. NENA understands the global nature of the Internet, and is eager to work with the IETF to ensure that emergency call processing meets the needs of users in North America.</t></abstract>
