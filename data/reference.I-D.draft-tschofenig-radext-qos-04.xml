<abstract><t>This document describes an extension to the RADIUS protocol that performs authentication, authorization, and accounting for Quality- of-Service reservations. The described extensions allow network elements to authenticate the initiator of a reservation request (if desired), to ensure that the reservation is authorized, and to account for established QoS resources. Flexibility is provided by offering support for different authorization models and by decoupling specific QoS attributes carried in the QoS signaling protocol from the AAA protocol. This document is the RADIUS complement to the DIAMETER QoS application.</t></abstract>
