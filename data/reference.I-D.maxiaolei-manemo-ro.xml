<abstract><t>Network Mobility Basic Support Protocol (NEMO BS) is the protocol proposed for the mobility management of mobile networks.  However, NEMO BS cannot deal with the problem of pinball routing in the nested mobile network.  And the related solutions are not yet considered and discussed in the IETF.  MANEMO (MANET for NEMO) is designed to solve this problem.  This article puts forward a novel MANEMO route optimization solution to solve the pinball routing in nested NEMO.</t></abstract>
