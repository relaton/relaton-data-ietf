<abstract><t>RFC 3177 argued that in IPv6, end sites should be assigned /48 blocks in most cases. The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) adopted those recommendations in 2002 and they have been in effect ever since. This document revisits and updates the IAB/IESG recommendations on the assignment of IPv6 address space to end sites. The exact choice of how much address space to assign end sites is a policy issue under the purview of the RIRs, subject to IPv6 architectural and operational considerations. This document reviews the architectural considerations and some of the operational issues and reiterates that changing the /48 recommendation is one of policy, and has minimal impact on the IPv6 architecture and on IETF Standards. This document obsoletes RFC 3177 and reclassifies it as historic.</t></abstract>
