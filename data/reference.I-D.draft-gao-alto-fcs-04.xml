<abstract><t>The ALTO cost query service maps a source-destination pair into a cost value, which provides a network view abstract based on a subset of the 2-dimension address space.  Given that the emergence of new networking optimization requirements, such a query space is not sufficient to uniquely identify a flow.  To address the limitations of the network information query space provided by the legacy ALTO protocol, this document introduces two extensions: extending the existing ALTO cost query services with fine-grained semantics, and enabling a new flow-based query service named Flow Cost Service. These extensions move ALTO to a more flexible and expressive network information query space.</t></abstract>
