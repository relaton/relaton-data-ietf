<abstract><t>The ForCES Forwarding Element Model [Model] defines a model and schema for representing Logical Functional Block (LFB) classes and their operational and capability attributes. The operational attributes of LFB instances within a Forwarding Element (FE) are manipulated by the ForCES protocol [ForCES] to configure the operation of the FE. The model assumes that any particular LFB attribute is owned and accessed exclusively by a single LFB instance. While this is a simple and clean restriction, we observe that it imposes some complications when defining LFBs. This memo addresses these complications and proposes that the restriction be re-examined.</t></abstract>
