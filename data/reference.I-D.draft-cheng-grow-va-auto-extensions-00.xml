<abstract><t>Auto-Configuration in Virtual Aggregation as specified in [I-D.ietf-grow-va-auto] requires configuration of a "VP-range list" in ASBRs connected to transit and peer ISPs.  These ASBRs simply tag some routes whose prefix falls within the VP-Range with a "can- suppress" tag to indicate whether these routes should be FIB installed.  This draft specified an extended auto-configuration mechanism in Virtual Aggregation to support the configuration of both "VP-List" and "popular prefixes".  Specifically, based on this mechanism, the ratio of lost packets when VP routes fail could be minimized.</t></abstract>
