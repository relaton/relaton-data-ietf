<abstract><t>This document presents a new group key distribution protocol, using group key distribution RFC 3547 with IKEv2 RFC 4306.  The new protocol is similar to IKEv2 in message and payload formats as well as message semantics.  The protocol is in conformance with MSEC key management architecture that it contains two components: member registration and group rekeying, both downloading group security associations from the GCKS to a member of the group.</t></abstract>
