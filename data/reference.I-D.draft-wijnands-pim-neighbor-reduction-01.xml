<abstract><t>PIM establishes a neighbor relationship with other routers directly connected to it on startup.  Networks that are LANs or behave like a LAN, potentially create many PIM neighbors depending on how many routers are attached to it.  If such a LAN is also a transit network (no directly connected source or receiver), many of the PIM procedures don't apply.  This proposal describes a procedure to reduce the amount of neighbors established over a transit LAN.</t></abstract>
