<abstract><t>This document outlines some interoperability issues observed  with the use of ARP over GMPLS controlled Ethernet router-to-  router (PSC) interfaces transiting from a non-Ethernet core,  e.g., FSC or LSC core. The document also recommends some  procedures to address these issues. The aim of this document  is to facilitate and ensure better interworking of GMPLS-  capable Label Switching Routers (LSRs), based on experience  gained in interoperability testing.  Conventions used in this document  In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client  and server respectively.</t></abstract>
