<abstract><t>In Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), the long handover latency and packet loss problems take place when a mobile node moves between access routers belonging to different Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) domain, called a macro mobility handover. To improve performance of the macro mobility handover, this document describes a method to execute macro mobility handover rapidly and to reduce both the handover latency and packet loss. The method described in this document is fast handovers for macro mobility handover by applying fast handover method of FMIPv6 protocol to the edge access routers in MAP domain. The two modes of fast handover are used according to the situation of the mobile node.</t></abstract>
