<abstract><t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a general authentication protocol that supports multiple authentication methods and typically runs directly over data link layers without requiring IP. EAP can be used for different types of authentication, where multiple providers provide access to different services. However, EAP itself does not have the ability to differentiate between multiple types of authentications. This document specifies a general encapsulation protocol, called Generic EAP Encapsulation (GEE), for differentiating between multiple EAP exchanges executed by a peer. This document specifies GEEv0 and provides a summary of capabilities to be specified in GEEv1.</t></abstract>
