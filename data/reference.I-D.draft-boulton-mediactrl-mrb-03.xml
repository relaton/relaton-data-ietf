<abstract><t>The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF is currently proposing an architecture for controlling media services.  The Session Initiation Protocol(SIP) will be used as the signalling protocol which provides many inherent capabilities for message routing.  In addition to such signalling properties, a need exists for intelligent, application level media service selection based on non-static signalling properties.  This is especially true when considered in conjunction with deployment architectures that include 1:M and M:M combinations of Application Servers and Media Servers.</t></abstract>
