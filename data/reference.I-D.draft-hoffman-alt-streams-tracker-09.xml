<abstract><t>This document describes extending the IETF Data Tracker to capture and display the progression of Internet Drafts that are intended to be published as RFCs by the IAB, IRTF, or Independent Submissions Editor.  The states and annotations that are to be added to the data tracker will be applied to a draft as soon as any of these streams identify the draft as a potential eventual RFC, and will continue through the lifetime of the draft.  The goal of adding this information to the Data Tracker is to give the community more information about the status of these drafts and the status of the streams themselves.</t></abstract>
