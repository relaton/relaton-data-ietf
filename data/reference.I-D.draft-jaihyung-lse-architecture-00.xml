<abstract><t>A solution for GMPLS implementation using 48bits of Ethernet multicast address as label is proposed. It is claimed that Ethernet bridges supporting IEEE 802.1D-2004 and IEEE 802.1Q-2003 may implement GMPLS according to this proposal without requiring modification to data plane, hence this solution is an appropriate candidate solution for GELS (GMPLS Ethernet Label Switching) group. The LSP established in this method is intrinsically bi-directional. Ethernet bridges of this implementation provide traffic engineered frame delivery path. Any point-to-point LSP can be transformed to multi-point LSP, and vice versa. It is interoperable with 802.1D/Q bridges. This proposal allows automated setup of VLAN using GMPLS in small scale network. IEEE 802.1 controlled spanning tree path may co- exist with GMPLS controlled LSP path when VLAN is used for segregating GMPLS flows and normal Ethernet flows. Clear advantage of this proposal compared to all-router based backbone network is cost- effectiveness that it helps reducing CAPEX/OPEX of operators. With the aid of well-established IP technology, it also helps enhancing scalability and manageability of bridged backbone network.</t></abstract>
