<abstract><t>RFC3484 defines source and destination address selection algorithms that are commonly deployed in current popular OSs. Meanwhile, there is a possibility to provide multiple addresses in one physical network. In such a multi-prefix environment, end-hosts could encounter some troubles in the communication because of default use of the RFC3484 mechanism. Some mechanism for the address selection problems are proposed including RFC3484 policy table distribution and RFC3484-update. This document describes the requirements for these address selection mechanisms.</t></abstract>
