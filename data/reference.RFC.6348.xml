<abstract><t>This document lists a set of functional requirements that served as input to the design of Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) extensions for setting up point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSP), in order to deliver point-to-multipoint applications over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) infrastructure.</t><t>This work was overtaken by the protocol solution developed by the MPLS working group, but that solution did not closely follow the requirements documented here.  This document is published as a historic record of the ideas and requirements that shaped the protocol work.  This document defines a Historic Document for the  Internet community.</t></abstract>
