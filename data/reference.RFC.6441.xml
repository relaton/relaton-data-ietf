<abstract><t>It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic from and BGP prefixes of unallocated IPv4 address space.  Now that there are no longer any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more complicated, fragile, and expensive.  Network administrators are advised to remove filters based on the registration status of the address space.</t><t>This document explains why any remaining packet and BGP prefix filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s should now be removed on border routers and documents those IPv4 unicast prefixes that should not be routed across the public Internet.  This memo documents an Internet  Best Current Practice.</t></abstract>
