<abstract><t>Digitally signed documents and data in a LTANS service receive the signature renwal procedures and non-repudiation services. As documents can be stored for very long (theoretically inifinite) times, it is very important to understand which data is and will be necessary for the verification of the contained digital signatures and the applied timestamps and the evidence records. This document shall describe various pieces of information which SHOULD and MUST be provided to effectively verify evidence records and their protected data and signatures.</t></abstract>
