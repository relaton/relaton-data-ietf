<abstract><t>IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband access. IEEE has specified several service specific convergence sublayers (CS) for 802.16 which are used by upper layer protocols. The ATM CS and Packet CS are the two main service-specific convergence sublayers and these are a part of the 802.16 MAC which the upper layers interface to. The packet CS is used for transport for all packet-based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP), IEEE Std. 802.3 (Ethernet) and, IEEE Std 802.1Q (VLAN). The IP specific part of the Packet CS enables transport of IPv4 packets directly over the 802.16 MAC. This document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) and address assignment procedures for transmitting Pv4 packets over IP Convergence Sublayer (IPCS) of IEEE 802.16. This document describes on how to deal with Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Mapping of multicast IP address to MAC address.</t></abstract>
