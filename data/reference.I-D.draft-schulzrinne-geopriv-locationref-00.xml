<abstract><t>Mobile devices sometimes want to give temporary access to their presence and location information to third parties that may not have a trust relationship with their presence server. Also, in addition to other mechanisms, application-layer location configuration protocols are helpful in building location-based systems. This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package, locationref, that periodically delivers randomized presence URLs to the target, which the target can then hand to call recipients and other parties.</t></abstract>
