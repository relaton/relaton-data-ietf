<abstract><t>QoSJava, an architecture decoupling QoS reuirements from QoS techniques is proposed in this draft. Referring to the idea of Java, QoSJava can conceal the heterogeneity of different QoS mechanisms as well as different vendors' devices. Users' requirements are translated into a "middle language", i.e. deployment task specification. And QoS mechanisms adapter plus Device Driver constitute the "Virtual Machine" of QoSJava. Thus network devices can be configured and QoS requirements can be fulfilled automatically. Moreover, QoSJava is not only compatible with current QoS mechanisms and devices, but open to new QoS solutions and advanced facilities in the future.</t></abstract>
