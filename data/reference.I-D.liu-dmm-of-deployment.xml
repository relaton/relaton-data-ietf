<abstract><t>Distributed Mobility Managment(DMM) aims to eliminate the centralized anchor point of current IP mobility solutions to get better scalability and optimize the data plane routing.  Many soulutions have been proposed in DMM working group but before defining any new DMM protocol, it is a good approach to investigate first whether it is feasible to deploy current IP mobility protocol in DMM scenario in a way that can meet all the requirment of DMM.This document discusses the way of the deployment of current IP mobility protocol in DMM scenario and analyses the gaps between this approach and the DMM requirment.</t></abstract>
