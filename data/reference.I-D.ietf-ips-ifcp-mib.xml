<abstract><t>The iFCP protocol [RFC4172] provides Fibre Channel fabric functionality on an IP network in which TCP/IP switching and routing elements replace Fibre Channel components. The iFCP protocol is used between iFCP Gateways. This draft provides a mechanism to monitor and control iFCP Gateway instances, and their associated sessions, using SNMP. This memo is a product of the IP Storage (IPS) working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at ips@ietf.org and/or the authors.</t></abstract>
