<abstract><t>This document describes an automatic and stateless IPv6 prefix delegation solution for IPv6-only networks.  The solution builds on automatic delegation mechanism defined by 6RD, but is suitable for IPv6-only networks, including those that have not deployed stateful DHCPv6.  The described stateless approach essentially exchanges the complexity of the stateful approach to consumption of IPv6 address space and more statical properties.</t></abstract>
