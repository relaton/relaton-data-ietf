<abstract><t>This document specifies a TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) IS-IS application sub-TLV that enables the reporting by a TRILL switch of sets of addresses such that all of the addresses in each set designate the same interface (port) and the reporting for such a set of the TRILL switch by which it is reachable. For example, a 48-bit MAC (Media Access Control) address, IPv4 address, and IPv6 address can be reported as all corresponding to the same interface reachable by a particular TRILL switch. Such information could be used in some cases to synthesize responses to or by-pass the need for the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol, or the flooding of unknown MAC addresses.</t></abstract>
