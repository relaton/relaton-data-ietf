<abstract><t>This document lists logging capabilities originally identified in Operational Security Requirements for Large Internet Service Provider (ISP) IP Network Infrastructure [RFC3871] and needed to support current operational practices, including those described in Operational Security Current Practices In Internet Service Provider Environments [RFC4778]. Logging is defined as the delivery of messages about the device, the data passing through the device, or the device's interaction with another device and has been traditionally provided via the syslog or SNMP protocols. Capabilities are defined without reference to specific technologies. This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies that implement the capability. Each capability cites the practices it supports. Current implementations that support the capability are cited. Special considerations are discussed as appropriate listing operational and resource constraints, limitations of current implementations, trade-offs, etc.</t></abstract>
