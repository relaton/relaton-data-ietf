<abstract><t>This document describes a Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction (FEC) Scheme for the one-dimensional (1-D) interleaved parity code and its application to reliable delivery of media streams in the context of FEC Framework.  The 1-D interleaved parity code is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in one or more repair flows in addition to the source symbols that are sent to the receiver(s) within a source flow.  The 1-D interleaved parity code offers a good protection against bursty packet losses at a cost of decent complexity.  This document extends the FEC header defined in RFC 2733 and registers a new RTP payload format for the FEC that is generated by the 1-D interleaved parity code from a source media encapsulated in RTP.  This new payload format is compatible with and used as a part of the DVB Application-layer FEC Specification.</t></abstract>
