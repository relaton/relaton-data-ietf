<abstract><t>Distributed applications -- such as file sharing, real-time communication, and live and on-demand media streaming -- prevalent on the Internet use a significant amount of network resources.  Such applications often transfer large amounts of data through connections established between nodes distributed across the Internet with little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  Some applications are so designed that they choose a random subset of peers from a larger set with which to exchange data.  Absent any topology information guiding such choices, or acting on suboptimal or local information obtained from measurements and statistics, these applications often make less than desirable choices.</t><t>This document discusses issues related to an information-sharing service that enables applications to perform better-than-random peer selection.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
