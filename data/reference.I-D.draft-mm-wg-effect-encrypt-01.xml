<abstract><t>Increased use of encryption will impact operations for security and network management causing a shift in how these functions are performed.  In some cases, new methods to both monitor and protect data will evolve.  In more drastic circumstances, the ability to monitor may be eliminated.  This draft includes a collection of current security and network management functions that may be impacted by the shift to increased use of encryption.  This draft does not attempt to solve these problems, but rather document the current state to assist in the development of alternate options to achieve the intended purpose of the documented practices.</t></abstract>
