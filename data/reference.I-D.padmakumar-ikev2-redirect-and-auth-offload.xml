<abstract><t>IKEv2 supports multiple authentication mechanisms like public key signatures, shared secrets and EAP.  EAP based authentication requires server to maintain information about the client until EAP completes.  Public key based authentication mechanisms are highly computational intensive and demands server CPU resources.  Redirect Mechanism for IKEv2 proposes a mechanism for IKEv2 that enables a VPN gateway to redirect the VPN client to another VPN gateway, for example, based on the load condition.  IKEv2 Session Resumption proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA.  Redirect mechanism can also be used to redirect a client to another router (trust anchor) to do mutual authentication and an optional proxy session negotiation on behalf of the server.  This redirection happens during the IKE_SA_INIT and server does not maintain any information about the redirected client.  After mutual authentication and optional proxy session negotiation trust anchor redirects the client back to the server with an Access Token which can be used as a dynamic pre-shared key between the server and client for password based IKE_AUTH exchange.  Mechanism described here allows servers to compute the same pre-shared key dynamically, without contacting trust anchors, based on the information provided by the client during IKE_AUTH exchange.  Access Token based authentication permits IDr of the responder to be different from that specified in Ticket and permits client to reuse the proxy session (negotiated between client and trust anchor) between client and server.  Such a mechanism is useful especially for low power devices like handsets.  For example, a mobile node can redirect a correspondent node to its home agent.  Home agent can form a proxy session with correspondent node and then redirect it back to mobile node.</t></abstract>
