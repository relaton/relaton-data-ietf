<abstract><t>The more demands for the lossless and low latency network in the modern datacenter appear because the proliferation of demanding applications. Some congestion control schemes such as CN, PFC, ETS which is introduced by IEEE 802.1 focus on the L2 network domain. While current TCP/IP stacks can't meet these requirement on L3 or above networks. This draft introduces the L3QCN(Layer 3 Quantized Congestion Notification), an end to end congestion control scheme which adopt QCN and DCQCN on L2 network. It specifies protocols, procedures, and managed objects to support congestion control on the datacenter network.</t></abstract>
