<abstract><t>This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for facilitating the application of virtual network abstractions to network operation. These abstractions shall create a virtualized environment supporting operators in viewing and controlling different domains (at any dimension: applied technology, administrative zones, or vendor-specific technology islands) as a single virtualized network.  Such an approach will facilitate the deployment of NFV (Network Function Virtualization) mechanisms, and accelerate rapid service deployment of new services, including more dynamic and elastic services, and improve overall network operations and scaling of existing services.  This use-case considers the application of these abstractions within the network of a single operator.</t></abstract>
