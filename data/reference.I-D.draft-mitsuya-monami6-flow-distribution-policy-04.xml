<abstract><t>The multiple care-of addresses registration protocol [1] allows a mobile node to maintain, at the same time, multiple virtual paths with its home agent or correspondent nodes. This document presents a policy data set for flow distribution to be used with the multiple care-of addresses registration protocol. This policy data set defines policies, in an OS-independant manner, for a mobile node and its home agent or correspondent node, from the point of view of one of these nodes. This data set is aimed to be processed by this node and the output is a set of filter rules to be used and exchanged with its correspondents.</t></abstract>
