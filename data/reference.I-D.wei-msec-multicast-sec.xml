<abstract><t>Multicast security algorithm based on agent node can select the group node corresponding to the smallest path cost to be the agent node, and multicast in accordance with the optimal multicast routing.  In addition, the multicast source node uses the key different from the group key to encrypt multicast data to meet the requirements of multicast security.  The agent nodes can be different for different multicast sources, which can spread the burden of the agent node and avoid the excessive burden problem when the same node as the agent node of different sources.</t></abstract>
