<abstract><t>Each PIM-SM router in a PIM Domain which supports ASM maintains Group-to-RP mappings which are used to identify a RP for a specific multicast group.  PIM-SM has defined an algorithm to choose a RP from the Group-to-RP mappings learned using various mechanisms.  This algorithm does not allow administrator to override a specific Group-to-RP mapping with the static Group-to-RP mapping which an administrator would want to use. This algorithm also does not consider the PIM mode and the mechanism through which a Group-to-RP mapping was learned.  This document first explains the requirements to extend the Group-to-RP mapping algorithm and then proposes the new algorithm.</t></abstract>
