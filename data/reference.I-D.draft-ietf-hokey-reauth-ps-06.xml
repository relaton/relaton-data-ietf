<abstract><t>This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) problem statement. The current Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) keying framework is not designed to support re-authentication and handovers. This often causes unacceptable latency in various mobile wireless environments. The HOKEY Working Group plans to address these problems by designing a generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for handover.</t></abstract>
