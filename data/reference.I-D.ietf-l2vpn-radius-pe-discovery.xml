<abstract><t>This document describes a strategy by which Provider Equipment (PE) can be dynamically provisioned for inclusion in PE-based Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs). This layered strategy utilizes the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol as a centralized control mechanism and can be used in conjunction with other proposed mechanisms. The mechanisms described in this document enhance those established by RFC 2868 and conform to those described by the L2VPN Framework.</t></abstract>
