<abstract><t>Client software often desires resources or identity claims that are managed independent of the client.  This protocol allows a user and/ or resource owner to delegate resource authorization and/or release of identity claims to an authorization server.  Client software can then request access to resources and/or identity claims by calling the authorization server.  The authorization server acquires consent and authorization from the user and/or resource owner if required, and then returns the authorization and identity claims that were approved.  This protocol can be extended to support alternative client authentication mechanisms, authorizations, claims, and interactions.
