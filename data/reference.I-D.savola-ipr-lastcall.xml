<abstract><t>This memo describes an additional policy with last calls regarding Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) disclosures or other knowledge of IPR. The existence and the pointer to the IPR disclosures or an indication of non-existence of knowledge of such disclosures must be mentioned in all IETF last calls and should be mentioned in working group last calls. Additionally, all documents under the IETF change control for which a last call prior to the approval was not required and IPR disclosures are known, must now be either last-called or rejected. This memo updates RFC 2026 and RFC 2418.</t></abstract>
