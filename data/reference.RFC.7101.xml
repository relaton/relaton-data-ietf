<abstract><t>At one time, the RFC Editor published snapshots of the &quot;Internet                    Official Protocol Standards&quot;.  These documents were known as xx00 documents, the last of which was published in May 2008.  These snapshots have been replaced by a web page, so the RFC Editor will no longer be publishing these snapshots as RFCs.  As a result, the RFC Editor will classify unpublished RFC xx00 numbers through 7000 as never issued.  Starting with the RFC number 7100, xx00 numbers will be available for assignment.</t></abstract>
