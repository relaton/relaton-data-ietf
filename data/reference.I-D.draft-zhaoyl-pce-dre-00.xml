<abstract><t>Path Computation Element (PCE) and distributed routing controller in GMPLS networks have different advantages of path computation respectively.  PCE is suitable for the path computation in multi- layer and multi-domain networks, especially in multi-constraints environment.  While distributed routing controller is good at the path computation in parallel and distributed network control in the local domain.  A cooperative path computation architecture named Dual Routing Engine (DRE) is proposed, which is based on the two path computation engines and can combine the advantages of centralized and distributed.  The corresponding PCE communication protocol extension and other protocol requirements for cooperation between PCE and distributed routing controller are listed in this document.</t></abstract>
