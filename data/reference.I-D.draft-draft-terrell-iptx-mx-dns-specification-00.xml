<abstract><t>This document defines the IPtX Specification for the 'Domain Name Service' (IPtX / IPtX-MX DNS), and eliminates the possibility of an Addressing 'Conflict', or a Mathematical Addressing Error in the IPtX Address Space. In other words, the IPtX / IPtX-MX IP Addressing format on the "Back-End", or "Backbone", obtains its uniqueness through the use and / or difference defined by the accuracy of the 'Exponential Decimal String'. However, this uniqueness, if not clarified, would not be discernable on the "Front-End", because the IPtX IP Addressing Specification 'Allows' only a '64' Bit-Mapped IP Address for every IP Addressing Format. That is, on the "Front-End", if there is No distinction, because every Addressing Format in the IPtX Specification, when Resolved, is Equal, there will ultimately be Address Conflicts within the Addressing Scheme.</t></abstract>
