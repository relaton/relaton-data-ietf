<abstract><t>The Problem of AAA-based key management for facilitating secure handovers in a wireless mobile environment as well as for optimizing re-authentications has been described in [I-D.nakhjiri-aaa-hokey-ps] and [I-D.clancy-hokey-reauth-ps]. This document provides a solution for the problems described in those drafts. Specifically an EAP initiated key hierarchy to significantly reduce handover and re- authentication latency is defined. A number of architectural and protocol trade-offs are also presented. Signaling messages, extensions and attributes for deploying the handover key hierarchy are shown in proactive and reactive modes. Document also proposes a method to solve channel binding problem.</t></abstract>
