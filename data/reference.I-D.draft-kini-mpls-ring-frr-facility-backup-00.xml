<abstract><t>Fast Re-route (FRR) using facility backup is a widely deployed traffic protection mechanism that can protect against link and node failure. It provides a fast protection switch mechanism to minimize traffic loss (typically sub 50msec) when the node that detects the failure locally, does the repair by re-routing the protected traffic to go over the bypass LSP. A direct application of this mechanism to a ring topology results in an inefficient use of link bandwidth. This document describes a mechanism to do it efficiently.</t></abstract>
