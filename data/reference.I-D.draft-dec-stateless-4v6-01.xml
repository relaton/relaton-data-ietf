<abstract><t>This document discusses the applicability and possible resolution of a number of issues attributed to A+P based solutions, specifically in the context of an IPv6 based solution characterised by this draft as a stateless 4Via6 (4V6) solution.  The document presents that the majority of the issues either do not apply to such stateless 4V6 solutions, or are no worse that in alternative NAT44 based solutions. The few remaining issues can be mitigated by the solutions or operators.</t></abstract>
