<abstract><t>OSPF is commonly used as a underlay routing protocol for MSDC (Massively Scalable Data Center) networks.  This document proposes some extensions to OSPF so as to reduce the OSPF flooding within MSDC networks greatly.  The reduction of the OSPF flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC networks.  These modifications are applicable to both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</t></abstract>
