<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 Return Routability Procedure (RRP) is used to secure the Binding Updates between a Mobile Node and a Correspondent Node where there is no pre-established security relationship between the two parties. This document puts forward a mechanism called ECC RRP, which enhances the key management for Return Routability Procedure with anonymous Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Key Agreement Protocol. The proposed procedure is not prone to attacks by nodes on the route from correspondent node to home agent in way that the RRP process described in RFC3775 is. It also reduces the latency related to handovers that require new binding updates.</t></abstract>
