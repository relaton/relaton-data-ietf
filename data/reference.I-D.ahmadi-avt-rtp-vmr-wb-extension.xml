<abstract><t>This document is an addendum to RFC xxxx, which specifies the real-time transport protocol for the Variable-Rate Multimode Wideband (VMR-WB) speech codec. This document contains the information related to the new operating mode of VMR-WB. All provisions, restrictions, use cases, features, etc. that are specified in RFC xxxx are applicable to the new operating mode without any exception. No new media type registration is included in this document as the new VMR-WB mode, defined in this document, will use the same media type specified in RFC xxxx (i.e., audio/VMR-WB). Note that the RFC xxxx was developed with sufficient flexibility for future extensions and thereby it allows the addition of new operating modes without any impacts on the interoperability of terminals supporting different versions of the VMR-WB standard.</t></abstract>
