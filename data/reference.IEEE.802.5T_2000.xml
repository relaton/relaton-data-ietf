  <abstract><t>This supplement specifies the changes required to ANSI/IEEE Std 802.5, 1998 Edition, (Base standard) and ANSI/IEEE Std 802.5r, 1998 Edition, and ANSI/IEEE Std 802.5j, 1998 Edition, (Amendment 1 standard) to support 100 Mbit/s dedicated token ring (DTR) operation. The Base standard, together with the Amendment 1 standard, specifies shared and dedicated (point-to-point) token ring operation at both 4 Mbit/s and 16 Mbit/s using either the TKP access protocol or the TXI access protocol. This supplement extends token ring operation to 100 Mbit/s for the DTR C-port and station using the TXI access protocol. Extensions to the medium access control (MAC) have been made to accommodate the requirements for high media rates (100 Mbit/s and above).</t>
