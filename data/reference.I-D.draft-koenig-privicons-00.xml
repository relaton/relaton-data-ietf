<abstract><t>This document proposes a syntax and semantics as an extension of the Internet Message Format (e-mail message) allowing a Sending User of an e-mail message to express his or her preference for how the message content is to be handled by the Receiving Users.  For this purpose, semantics of sets of different character combinations ("Privicons") are described.  These can syntactically be integrated either in the first-line of the body, in the subject line and/or in a dedicated header of any e-mail message.  The Privicons icon set consists of 6 different icons.  They'll be machine readable.  The Privicons concept is partly borrowing its approach from the concept of emoticons.  For example, to express that the content may be forwarded and even be published, the Sending User could use the Privicon "[>]", which may be followed by an additional explanations, such as "please share".</t></abstract>
