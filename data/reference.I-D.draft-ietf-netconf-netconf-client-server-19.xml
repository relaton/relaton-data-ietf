<abstract><t>This document defines two YANG modules, one module to configure a NETCONF client and the other module to configure a NETCONF server. Both modules support both the SSH and TLS transport protocols, and support both standard NETCONF and NETCONF Call Home connections.

Change Log  Note to Reviewers (To be removed by RFC Editor)  This document presents a YANG module or modules that is/are part of a collection of drafts that work together to produce the ultimate goal of the NETCONF WG: to define configuration modules for NETCONF client and servers, and RESTCONF client and servers.  The relationship between the various drafts in the collection is presented in the below diagram.  crypto-types ^      ^ /        \ /          \ trust-anchors        keystore ^     ^              ^  ^ |     +---------+    |  | |               |    |  | |       +------------+  | tcp-client-server     |      /        |       | ^    ^        ssh-client-server    |       | |    |           ^            tls-client-server |    |           |              ^     ^        http-client-server |    |           |              |     |                 ^ |    |           |        +-----+     +---------+       | |    |           |        |                     |       | |    +-----------|--------|--------------+      |       | |                |        |              |      |       | +-----------+    |        |              |      |       | |    |        |              |      |       | |    |        |              |      |       | netconf-client-server       restconf-client-server   Full draft names and link to drafts:  o  draft-ietf-netconf-crypto-types (html [1])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-trust-anchors (html [2]) o  draft-ietf-netconf-keystore (html [3])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server (html [4])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-ssh-client-server (html [5])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client-server (html [6])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-http-client-server (html [7])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-netconf-client-server (html [8])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-restconf-client-server (html [9])</t></abstract>
