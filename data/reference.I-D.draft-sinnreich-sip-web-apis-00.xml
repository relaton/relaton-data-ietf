<abstract><t>Interactive communications are becoming part of rich Internet applications (RIA). This can be accomplished entirely by using Web technology and developing it as an Internet standard. Voice over IP (VoIP) features developed for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP 2.0) can be preserved in rich multimedia communications and applications on the web.  Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) is used for control and signaling data and RTP for interactive media transport respectively. No other network application protocols are required. Web, fixed and mobile device application development tools can thus be used to include components and widgets for Internet presence, Instant Messaging (IM), voice and video.  This opens Internet communications, including voice to application developers and will also enhance the user experience with real-time Web and mobile communications.  Usage scenarios include service providers, private IP networks, device application developers and media companies providing a mix of integrated communications, applications and media. This memo argues for the development and standardization of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to allow the benefits of SIP to be used by Rich Internet Applications (RIA), for fixed and mobile devices.</t></abstract>
