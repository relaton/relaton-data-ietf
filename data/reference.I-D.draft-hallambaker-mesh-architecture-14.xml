<abstract><t>The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure infrastructure that makes computers easier to use by making them more secure.  The Mesh provides a set of protocol and cryptographic building blocks that enable encrypted data stored in the cloud to be accessed, managed and exchanged between users with the same or better ease of use than traditional approaches which leave the data vulnerable to attack.  This document provides an overview of the Mesh data structures, protocols and examples of its use.  [Note to Readers]  Discussion of this draft takes place on the MATHMESH mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.  This document is also available online at http://mathmesh.com/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh- architecture.html.</t></abstract>
