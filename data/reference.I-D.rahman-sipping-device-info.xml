<abstract><t>This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package to carry device information including device status and device profile. Device status refers to a set of dynamic attributes that describe device's operating state, availability, and location information etc. Device profile on the other hand refers to a limited set of static attributes including device type, name, format type of status information, and model etc. of a particular device. Device status information is particularly important to monitoring applications where a user agent would be able to monitor the status of a SIP device from a remote location and be notified of the changes of status.</t></abstract>
