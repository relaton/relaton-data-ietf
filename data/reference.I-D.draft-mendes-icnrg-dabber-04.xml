<abstract><t>This draft describes the Data reAchaBility BasEd Routing (DABBER) protocol, which aims to extend the operation of distributed Information Centric Networking frameworks to opportunistic wireless networks such as Delay Tolerant Networks.  By "opportunistic wireless networks" it is meant multi-hop wireless networks where finding an end-to-end path between any pair of nodes at any moment in time may be a challenge.  The goal is to assist in better defining opportunities for the transmission of Interest and Data packets in a store-carry-and-forward manner, based on a combination of proactive and reactive approaches.  The document presents an architectural overview of DABBER followed by the specification of the proactive approach based on the dissemination of name-prefix information, and the reactive approach based on the encounters probability.</t></abstract>
