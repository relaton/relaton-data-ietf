<abstract><t>This memo shows an example of how to provide and implement IPv4/IPv6 dual stack anycast DNS services, which are based on the experience of IPv4/IPv6 anycast DNS implementation. In order to provide a reference model to DNS operators who have a plan to deploy IPv4/IPv6 anycast DNS services onto their own DNS servers in the future, this memo mainly specifies a way to configure IPv6-related functions without IPv4-related matters.</t></abstract>
