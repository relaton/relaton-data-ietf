<title>An Architecture for Network Management Using NETCONF and YANG</title>

<date year='2011' month='June' />
<abstract><t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) gives access to native capabilities of the devices within a network, defining methods for manipulating configuration databases, retrieving operational data, and invoking specific operations.  YANG provides the means to define the content carried via NETCONF, both data and operations.  Using both technologies, standard modules can be defined to give interoperability and commonality to devices, while still allowing devices to express their unique capabilities.</t><t>This document describes how NETCONF and YANG help build network management applications that meet the needs of network operators. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
