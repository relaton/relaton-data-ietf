<abstract><t>A forwarding device may get reset (automatically or manually) and subsequently may experience an outage. It is deemed useful to know how long a device would take to recover after such an event.  Moreover, there are varieties of reset triggers each deserving special attention. Hence, clarity and consistency in reset procedures (above and beyond what's specified in RFC2544) are crucial to derive the meaningful results.  This document specifies a methodology for characterizing reset during benchmarking of forwarding devices, and provides clarity and consistency in reset procedures beyond what's specified in RFC2544. It therefore updates RFC2544.</t></abstract>
