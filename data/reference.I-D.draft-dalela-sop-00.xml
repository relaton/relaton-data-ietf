<abstract><t>Cloud services need to interoperate across cloud providers, service vendors and private/public domains. To enable this interoperability, there is need for a standard wire-format for exchanging service information. This document describes a Service Orchestration Protocol (SOP) to be used as a standard wire-format for cloud exchanges. Similar to widely used protocols like HTTP, SIP and SMTP, SOP uses text-based messages, which are easily extensible and may be inspected at cloud proxies. While SOP carries service-independent information, service-dependant information is attached as a Service Description Framework [SDF] payload to SOP packets. This is similar to how HTML is transported over HTTP. SDF is a XML schema for describing services. SOP and SDF enable any kind of service to be discovered and orchestrated across private and public domains. Simple protocol compliance tests can be employed to ensure interoperability across domains. SOP wire-formats can be used with existing cloud APIs. Using these, it would be possible to interoperate diverse APIs and cloud services across service providers, service vendors and service users.</t></abstract>
