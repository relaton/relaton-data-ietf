<abstract><t>IEEE 802.1ah draft standard [IEEE802.1ah], also known as Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB) defines an architecture and bridge protocols for interconnection of multiple Provider Bridge Networks (PBNs). PBB was defined in IEEE as a connectionless technology based on multipoint VLAN tunnels. MSTP is used as the core control plane for loop avoidance, load balancing. As a result the coverage of the solution is limited, service providers avoiding large scale deployments of STP in the core of their network. Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4762] provides a solution based on superior tunneling capabilities through the use of routed, traffic engineered backbone. As a result VPLS has been deployed on a large scale in service provider networks, providing also for a fully interoperable, extensible model. This draft discusses extensions to VPLS model required to incorporate desirable PBB components while maintaining the Service Provider fit of the initial model.</t></abstract>
