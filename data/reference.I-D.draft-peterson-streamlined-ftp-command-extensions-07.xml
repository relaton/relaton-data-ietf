<abstract><t>This document specifies FTP commands to download thumbnails of remote images, remove entire directory trees, request the amount of storage space available to the user, and to request the size of a remote directory and its contents.  The commands are designed to reduce the number of server / client exchanges, provide information that was not previously available, and to reduce bandwidth requirements for some higher level operations.</t></abstract>
