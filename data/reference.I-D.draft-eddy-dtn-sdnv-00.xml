<abstract><t>Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced as fields used in proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols. The basic goal of an SDNV is to hold a positive integer value of arbitrary magnitude, without consuming much more space than necessary. This can be desirable in allowing protocol header fields to evolve as appropriate for a given use, without making difficult and potentially erroneous engineering decisions that may have to be hacked around in the future. This document describes formats and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, and discusses several other aspects of SDNVs.</t></abstract>
