<abstract><t>The question often arises of whether or not a given security system requires some form of automated key management, or whether manual keying is sufficient. This memo proposes guidelines for making such decisions. The presumption is that when symmetric cryptographic mechanisms are used in a protocol, then automated key management is generally but not always needed. If manual keying is proposed, the burden of proving that automated key management is not required falls to the proposer.</t></abstract>
