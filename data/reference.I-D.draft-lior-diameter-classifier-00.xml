<abstract><t>Many Diameter applications require to classify packets. Diameter base protocols provides an IP Filter Rule type and a QoS Filter Rule type that is being used to classify packets. However, because these types were defined for specific uses and defined in ways that are hard to extend and therefore are not generally applicable for those applications that require packet classifiers. This document describes a set of Diameter types that are useful to create packet classifiers. The packet classier type can be used by various applications to express packet classifiers that best match the application's specific needs.</t></abstract>
