<title>Routing Backus-Naur Form (RBNF): A Syntax Used to Form Encoding Rules in Various Routing Protocol Specifications</title>
<author initials='A.' surname='Farrel' fullname='A. Farrel'><organization /></author>
<date year='2009' month='April' />
<abstract><t>Several protocols have been specified in the Routing Area of the IETF using a common variant of the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) of representing message syntax.  However, there is no formal definition of this version of BNF.</t><t>There is value in using the same variant of BNF for the set of protocols that are commonly used together.  This reduces confusion and simplifies implementation.</t><t>Updating existing documents to use some other variant of BNF that is already formally documented would be a substantial piece of work.</t><t>This document provides a formal definition of the variant of BNF that has been used (that we call Routing BNF) and makes it available for use by new protocols.
