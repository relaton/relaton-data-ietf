<abstract><t>Traditionally, routing systems have implemented routing and signaling (e.g.  MPLS) to control traffic forwarding in a network.  Route computation has been controlled by relatively static policies that define link cost, route cost, or import and export routing policies. With the advent of highly dynamic data center networking, on-demand WAN services, dynamic policy-driven traffic steering and service chaining, the need for real-time security threat responsiveness via traffic control, and a paradigm of separating policy-based decision- making from the router itself, requirements have emerged to more dynamically manage and program routing systems.  These requirements should allow controlling routing information and traffic paths and extracting network topology information, traffic statistics, and other network analytics from routing systems.  This document proposes meeting this need via an Interface to the Routing System (I2RS).</t></abstract>
