<abstract><t>This document describes a simple HTTP state management mechanism, called cake, that lets HTTP servers maintain stateful sessions with HTTP user agents.  This mechanism is harmonized with the same-origin security model and provides both confidentiality and integrity protection against active network attackers.  In addition, the mechanism is robust to cross-site request forgery attacks.Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)  If you have suggestions for improving this document, please send email to &lt;mailto:http-state@ietf.org>.
