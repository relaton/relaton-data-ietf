<abstract><t>Many resources provided on the Web are part of a sets of resources that are provided in a context that is defined and managed by one particular service provider.  Often, these sets of resources are referred to as "Web Services" or "Web APIs".  This specification defines two link relations that allow to represent relationships from those resources to ones that provide documentation or descriptions of the Web services.  The difference between these concepts is that documentation is primarily intended for human consumers, whereas descriptions are primarily intended for automated consumers.</t></abstract>
