<abstract><t>RANGER is an architectural framework for scalable routing and addressing in networks with global enterprise recursion.  The term &quot;enterprise network&quot; within this context extends to a wide variety of use cases and deployment scenarios, where an &quot;enterprise&quot; can be as small as a Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) network, as dynamic as a Mobile Ad Hoc Network, as complex as a multi-organizational corporation, or as large as the global Internet itself.  Such networks will require an architected solution for the coordination of routing and addressing plans with accommodations for scalability, provider-independence, mobility, multihoming, and security.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
