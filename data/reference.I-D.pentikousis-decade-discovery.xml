<abstract><t>A DECADE system must provide discovery mechanisms which enable the automatic configuration of DECADE clients with all information necessary to contact appropriate DECADE servers in the network. Typically, this configuration information would include the domain name or IP address of each DECADE server that should be considered by the client.  Ideally, a DECADE discovery mechanism should capitalize upon existing Internet protocols, such as DHCP, which is widely deployed today.  This document discusses DECADE server discovery and, as a first step towards automatic discovery, specifies how a DECADE client can obtain server location information using DHCP.  To this end, it defines two DHCPv6 options which can be used to automatically provision the domain name or IP address of suitable servers in a DECADE system.</t></abstract>
