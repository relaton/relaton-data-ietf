<abstract><t>This document defines three YANG modules: the first defines a grouping for configuring a generic TCP client, the second defines a grouping for configuring a generic TCP server, and the third defines a grouping common to the TCP clients and TCP servers.

Change Log  Note to Reviewers (To be removed by RFC Editor)  This document presents a YANG module or modules that is/are part of a collection of drafts that work together to produce the ultimate goal of the NETCONF WG: to define configuration modules for NETCONF client and servers, and RESTCONF client and servers.  The relationship between the various drafts in the collection is presented in the below diagram.  crypto-types ^      ^ /        \ /          \ trust-anchors        keystore ^     ^              ^  ^ |     +---------+    |  | |               |    |  | |       +------------+  | tcp-client-server     |      /        |       | ^    ^        ssh-client-server    |       | |    |           ^            tls-client-server |    |           |              ^     ^        http-client-server |    |           |              |     |                 ^ |    |           |        +-----+     +---------+       | |    |           |        |                     |       | |    +-----------|--------|--------------+      |       | |                |        |              |      |       | +-----------+    |        |              |      |       | |    |        |              |      |       | |    |        |              |      |       | netconf-client-server       restconf-client-server   Full draft names and link to drafts:  o  draft-ietf-netconf-crypto-types (html [1])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-trust-anchors (html [2])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-keystore (html [3])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server (html [4])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-ssh-client-server (html [5])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client-server (html [6])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-http-client-server (html [7])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-netconf-client-server (html [8])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-restconf-client-server (html [9])</t></abstract>
