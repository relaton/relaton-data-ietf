<abstract><t>This draft describes an AI based TCP-IP model. By understanding how the Network is evolving from a Wireless and Software perspective the limitations of current Internet Architecture are identified and the corrections needed for the Big Data bottleneck present in current Internet Architecture are described further. This draft explains about the implicit life cycle between the Cloud, Network and Internet. An important conclusion is drawn that the Network cannot be declassified from the Cloud. Based on the evolution of the Virtualized Datacenter within the Cloud architecture framework and the implicit fact that the Network also needs to grow and scale towards the Cloud another important conclusion that the whole Topological address space which is the current IP address space (IP as well as IPv6) needs to be reclassified or divided into a physical (or logical) address space and a new Virtual address space. The Virtual address space is a Centralized Control plane which only processes routing information. A future Internet architecture for resolving the Big Data bottleneck which introduces a Virtual address space at specific Intersection points such as Inter-AS, CsC and IXP (Internet Exchange Points) is described.</t></abstract>
