<abstract><t>This document describes TIPC, a protocol intended to be used as a TML (Transport Mapping Layer) for the ForCES protocol[ForCES] when that protocol is transported over L2 carriers such as Ethernet, RapidIO or PCI-Express. TIPC is specially designed for efficient communication within clusters of loosely coupled nodes, and may as such even be used outside the context of being a ForCES protocol carrier. It would even be an excellent candidate as a ForCES pre-association phase setup protocol.</t></abstract>
