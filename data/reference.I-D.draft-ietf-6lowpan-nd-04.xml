<abstract><t>This document specifies Neighbor Discovery optimized for 6LoWPAN. The 6LoWPAN format allows IPv6 to be used over energy and bandwidth constrained wireless networks often making use of multihop topologies.  However, the use of standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery with 6LoWPAN has several problems.  Standard Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non-transitive wireless links, and the standard IPv6 link concept and heavy use of multicast makes it inefficient.  This document specifies a new ND mechanism allowing for the efficient detection of duplicate addresses over entire LoWPANs, which also optimizes other ND operations.  In addition context dissemination, claim and defend address generation, and the support of Extended LoWPANs over Backbone Links are specified.</t></abstract>
