<abstract><t>This memo analyzes provider-to-provider QoS agreements suitable for a global QoS-enabled Internet. It defines terminology relevant to inter-domain QoS models. It proposes a new concept denoted by Meta- QoS-Class (MQC). This concept could potentially drive and federate the way QoS inter-domain relationships are built between providers. It opens up new perspectives for a QoS-enabled Internet that retains, as much as possible, the openness of the existing best-effort Internet.</t></abstract>
