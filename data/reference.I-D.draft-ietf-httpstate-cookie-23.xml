<abstract><t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields. These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used on the Internet.  This document obsoletes [RFC2965].Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)  If you have suggestions for improving this document, please send email to &lt;mailto:http-state@ietf.org>.  Suggestions with test cases are especially appreciated.  Further Working Group information is available from &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpstate/>.</t></abstract>
