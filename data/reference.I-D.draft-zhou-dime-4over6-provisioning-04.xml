<abstract><t>During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, customer equipment may have to support one of the various transition methods that have been defined for carrying IPv4 packets over IPv6.  This document enumerates the information that needs to be provisioned on a customer edge router to support a list of transition techniques based on tunneling IPv4 in IPv6, with a view to defining reusable components for a reasonable transition path between these techniques.  To the extent that the provisioning is done dynamically, AAA support is needed to provide the information to the network server responsible for passing the information to the customer equipment.  This document specifies Diameter (RFC 6733) attribute-value pairs to be used for that purpose.</t></abstract>
