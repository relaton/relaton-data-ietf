<abstract><t>HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a design for an HTTP authentication method with credentials that are not vulnerable to phishing attacks, and that does not require a server-side password database.  The design can also be used in Javascript-based authentication embedded in HTML.  HOBA is an alternative to HTTP authentication schemes that require passwords with all the negative attributes that come with password-based systems.</t></abstract>
