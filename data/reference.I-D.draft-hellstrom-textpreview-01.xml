<abstract><t>This specification defines a method for presentation of a real-time text conversation. The aim is to give the participants in a conversation a good opportunity to perceive the real-time flow of the conversation and also provide a display of the history of the conversation that makes it easy to read. This is achieved by arranging the presentation of the conversation in separate areas for real-time text entries in creation versus completed text entries.</t></abstract>
