<abstract><t>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the Internet of Things.  It was created as a common language for use in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization (OneDM) definitions.  Tools convert this format to database formats and other serializations as needed.</t><t> An SDF specification describes definitions of SDF Objects and their associated interactions (Events, Actions, Properties), as well as the Data types for the information exchanged in those interactions.</t><t> A JSON format representation of SDF 1.0 was defined in a previous (-00) version of this document.  The present document has been designated as an _implementation draft_, labeled SDF 1.1, at the IETF110 meeting of the ASDF WG (2021-03-11).</t></abstract>
