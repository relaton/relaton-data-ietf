<abstract><t>RFC 5681 [RFC5681] documents the following four intertwined TCP congestion control algorithms: Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit, and Fast Recovery.  RFC 5681 explicitly allows certain modifications of these algorithms, including modifications that use the TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) option [RFC2883], and modifications that respond to "partial acknowledgments" (ACKs which cover new data, but not all the data outstanding when loss was detected) in the absence of SACK.  This document describes a specific algorithm for responding to partial acknowledgments, referred to as NewReno.  This response to partial acknowledgments was first proposed by Janey Hoe in [Hoe95].  The purpose of this revision from [RFC3782] is to make errata changes and to adopt a proposal from Yoshifumi Nishida to slightly increase the minimum window size after Fast Recovery from one to two segments, to improve performance when the receiver uses delayed acknowledgments.</t></abstract>
