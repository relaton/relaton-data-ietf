<abstract><t>This document introduces a new document series called Set of RFC Documents (SRDs). SRDs will be distinguished by names and serial numbers. SRDs contain Extensible Markup Language (XML) which can automatically produce HTML and plaintext versions for human consumption With many RFC being updated, this creates difficulty when determining which RFCs are necessary as references when implementing or using protocols. Grouping RFC into sets that embody a specific endeavour would permit stable references for those interested in discovering related details. The SRD name may also serve as a reference for topical information stored in a database that is made available.</t></abstract>
