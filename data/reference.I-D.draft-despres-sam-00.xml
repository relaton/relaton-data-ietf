<abstract><t>Stateless Local Address Mapping (SAM) is a generic tool for global- address packets to traverse transit domains where routing is performed in different address spaces.  To share IPv4 global addresses among several CPEs and/or hosts, port prefixes can be used as extensions of IPv4 global addresses.  In this space (IPv4E), a node having an n-bits IPv4E prefix with n>32 may only use or delegate ports having its port prefix of length /32-n.  Static Address Mappers can be placed in CPEs, in hosts, and/or in ISP Internet gateways. Applications include various IPv6 in IPv4 and IPv4E in IPv6 encapsulations.</t></abstract>
