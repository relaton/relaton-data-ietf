<abstract><t>The Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) allows hop-by-hop integrity protection of RSVP neighbors.  This requires messages to be cryptographically protected using a shared secret between participating nodes.  This document compares group keying for RSVP with per-neighbor or per-interface keying, and discusses the associated key provisioning methods as well as applicability and limitations of these approaches.  This document also discusses applicability of encrypting RSVP messages.  This document is not an  Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational  purposes.</t></abstract>
