<abstract><t>TPA-SSP (DKIM Third-Party Authorization for Sender Signing Practices) is a DNS-based label prefix mechanism to provide a means to authorize Third-Party signing domains in a scalable fashion. This mechanism eliminates complex coordination of selector/key DNS records, DNS zone delegation, or exchanges of public/private keys otherwise required to facilitate desired authorizations. Checking Sender Signing Practices occurs in common cases where an originating email-address of concern is not within a DKIM signing domain. In which case, the email- address has not been signed, or is signed by a Third-Party domain.</t></abstract>
