<abstract><t>In this draft, a mechanism to grasp the network situation is proposed for improving end-to-end path throughput. The proposed mechanism is based on the active packet-train probing based estimation. The proposed mechanism defines three cases of the difference between the average output gap and the input gap, and then reflects fully them. Since three cases are handled respectively by appropriate corresponding manners, the proposed mechanism can be expected to reduce the detection error for the turning point. Therefore, through the proposed mechanism, the available bandwidth can be estimated more reliably.</t></abstract>
