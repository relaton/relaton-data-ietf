<abstract><t>The NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] defines ways to read configuration and state data from a NETCONF server.  In some cases, a client-configured data item refers to a non-existent system generated data item (e.g.,the auto-create interfaces ("eth1") is not yet present).  In many situations, the system configured data item doesn't need to be know to the client and client-configured data item will automatically be removed from the operational state datastore and thus only appear in the intended datastore if client-configured data item doesn't exist.  In other situations system configured data item needs to be known and overriden by the client.  Not all server implementations treat the system configuration data in the same way.  This document defines a capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol that allows the NETCONF client to identify how system configuration are processed by the server, and also defines a new mechanism for client control of server processing of system configuration data.</t></abstract>
