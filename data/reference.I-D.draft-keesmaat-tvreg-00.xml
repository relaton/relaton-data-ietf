<abstract><t>The tv:URI is an existing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme to refer to television broadcasts. These include all types of analog and digital television broadcasts, like terrestrial TV broadcasts, satellite TV broadcasts, cable TV broadcast, IP television and web TV. This document defines a registry for tv:URIs. A registry is needed to solve the ambiguity about tv:URIs in two directions: for each (registered) tv:URI it identifies uniquely and unambiguously the television broadcast it refers to, and vice versa it provides a single tv:URI for each (registered) television broadcast.</t></abstract>
