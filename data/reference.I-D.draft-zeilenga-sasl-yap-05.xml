<abstract><t>This document describes a password authentication mechanism, called  YAP-SHA-256, for use in protocols which support Simple Authentication   and Security Layer (SASL) framework. The mechanism relies on security   services provided by a lower layer, such as Transport Layer Security   (TLS), to protect the authentication exchange, and subsequent   application data exchange, from common attacks. The YAP-SHA-256   mechanism may be viewed as an alternative to other password-based SASL   mechanism, such as PLAIN, CRAM-MD5, and DIGEST-MD5.</t></abstract>
