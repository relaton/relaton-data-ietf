<abstract><t>This document specifies an identifier and challenge type required to enable the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) to issue certificates using a token for the challenge response.  This token is issued by a administrative authority with whom the Certification Authority (CA) has a trust relationship.  The entity requesting a certificate also has a relationship with the administrative authority, such that the administrative authority assigns a unique code to the entity.  This entity code is included as part of the token that the administrative authority issues.</t></abstract>
