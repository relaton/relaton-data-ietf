<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software- Defined Networking (SDN) systems.  It can compute optimal paths for traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic demands.</t><t>PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).</t><t>SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing, Service Function Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network.  It is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller.</t><t>This document briefly introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller, examines the motivations and applicability for PCEP as a control protocol in this environment, and introduces the implications for the protocol.  A PCE-based central controller can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it.</t><t>This document does not describe use cases in detail and does not define protocol extensions: that work is left for other documents.</t></abstract>
