<abstract><t>This document describes a framework how the current IPv4 address space can be divided in two new address categories; a core address space (Area Locators, ALOC) that is globally unique and an edge address space (Endpoint Locators, ELOC) that is regionally unique - in the future the ELOC space is only significant in a private network or in a service provider domain, therefore a 32 x 32 bit addressing scheme is possible. The core/edge address grouping will enable a new level of hierarchy in the routing architecture of Internet. The hierarchical IPv4 framework is backwards compatible with the current IPv4 framework; it will also discuss a method to decouple the location and identifier functions, future applications can make use of the separation. The framework requires extensions to the existing Domain Name System, the existing IPv4 stack of the endpoints, security nodes and to routers in the Internet. The framework can be implemented incrementally to endpoints, DNS, security nodes and routers. This document is a product within the IRTF Routing Research Group. The views in this document are considered controversial by the IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) but the group reached a consensus that the document should still be published.</t></abstract>
