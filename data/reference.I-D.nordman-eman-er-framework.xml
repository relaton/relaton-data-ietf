<abstract><t>Managing energy consumption of devices presents new challenges and issues.  The EMAN Requirements draft identifies essential capabilities needed to accomplish this.  This draft describes how an energy management system can use EMAN to gather and interpret data from individual devices, and how some of the Requirements are implemented in the model.  This document focuses on Energy Reporting, though acknowledges and fully includes the limited control functions specified in the Requirements draft.  Topics addressed in detail include the topology of power distribution, reporting mechanisms, and the various roles of devices, power interfaces, and components.</t></abstract>
