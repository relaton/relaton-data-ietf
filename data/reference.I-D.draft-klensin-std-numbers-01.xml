<abstract><t>STD numbers are assigned to IETF Standards Track specifications in order to provide a stable reference even when RFCs are revised and the underlying documents change.  However, the numbers are only assigned when the specifications reach Full Standard maturity level, significantly reducing their utility in the contemporary world in which few specifications advance beyond the first standardization maturity level.  For that reason, one recent proposal suggested eliminating the numbers entirely.  This document argues that stable references for Standards Track specifications are actually useful and that the solution is not to abolish the numbers but to change the point at which they are assigned.</t></abstract>
