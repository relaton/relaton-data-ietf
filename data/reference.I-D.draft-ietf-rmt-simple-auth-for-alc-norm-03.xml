<abstract><t>This document introduces four schemes that provide a per-packet authentication and integrity service in the context of the ALC and NORM protocols.  The first scheme is based on digital signatures. Because it relies on asymmetric cryptography, this scheme generates a high processing load at the sender and to a lesser extent at a receiver, as well as a significant transmission overhead.  It is therefore well suited to low data rate sessions.  The second scheme relies on the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).  If this approach also relies an asymmetric cryptography, the processing load and the transmission overhead are significantly reduced compared to traditional digital signature schemes.  It is therefore well suited to medium data rate sessions.  The third scheme relies on a group Message Authentication Code (MAC).  Because this scheme relies on symmetric cryptography, MAC calculation and verification are fast operations, which makes it suited to high data rate sessions. However it only provides a group authentication and integrity service, which means that it only protects against attackers that are not group members.  Finally, the fourth scheme merges the digital signature and group group schemes, and is useful to mitigate DoS attacks coming from attackers that are not group members.</t></abstract>
