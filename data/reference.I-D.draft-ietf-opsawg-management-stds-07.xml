<abstract><t>This document gives an overview of the IETF network management standards and summarizes existing and ongoing development of IETF standards-track network management protocols and data models.  The document refers to other overview documents, where they exist and classifies the standards for easy orientation.  The purpose of this document is on the one hand to help system developers and users to select appropriate standard management protocols and data models to address relevant management needs.  On the other hand, the document can be used as an overview and guideline by other Standard Development Organizations or bodies planning to use IETF management technologies and data models.  This document does not cover OAM technologies on the data-path, e.g.  OAM of tunnels, MPLS-TP OAM, and Pseudowire as well as the corresponding management models.</t></abstract>
