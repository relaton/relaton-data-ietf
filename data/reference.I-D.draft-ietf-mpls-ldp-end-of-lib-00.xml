<abstract><t>There are situations following LDP session establishment where it  would be useful for an LDP speaker to know when its peer has advertised all of its labels.  These include session establishment when LDP-IGP sync is in use, as well as session re-establishment following loss of an LDP session when LDP graceful restart is in use. The LDP specification [RFC5036] provides no mechanism for an LDP speaker to notify a peer when it has completed its initial label advertisements to that peer.  This document specifies means for an LDP speaker to signal completion of its initial label advertisements following session establishment.  Conventions used in this document  In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.</t></abstract>
