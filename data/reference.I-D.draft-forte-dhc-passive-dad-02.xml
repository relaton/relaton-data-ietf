<abstract><t>In a Layer 3 (L3) handoff procedure, one of the biggest components in terms of delay is introduced by the DHCP address acquisition time required for obtaining a valid IP address for the new subnet. Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is the most time consuming part of the whole DHCP procedure. In this document we propose a new DAD scheme which has been proven to be effective without introducing any significant delay. By using such a scheme we can avoid duplicate address and at the same time keep the address acquisition time in the order of a few milliseconds. Using the new procedure will also permit to detect an unauthorized use of a particular IP address even if no duplicate IP has yet occurred.</t></abstract>
