<abstract><t>The logs in Certificate Transparency are untrusted in the sense that the users of the system don't have to trust that they behave correctly since the behavior of a log can be verified to be correct.  This document tries to solve the problem with logs presenting a "split view" of their operations or failing to incorporate a submission within MMD.  It describes three gossiping mechanisms for Certificate Transparency: SCT Feedback, STH Pollination and Trusted Auditor Relationship.</t></abstract>
