<abstract><t>This document describes the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) algorithm for applying dynamically retrieved string transformation rules to an application-unique string.  Well-formed transformation rules will reflect the delegation of management of information associated with the string.  This document is also part of a series that is completely specified in &quot;Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Part One: The Comprehensive DDDS&quot; (RFC 3401).  It is very important to note that it is impossible to read and understand any document in this series without reading the others.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
