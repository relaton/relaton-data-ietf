<abstract><t>This memo presents the different security threats related to SPEERMINT classifying them into threats to the Location Function, to the Signaling Function and to the Media Function.  The different instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the classification.  Finally the existing security solutions in SIP and RTP/RTCP are presented to describe the countermeasures currently available for such threats.  The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate the SPEERMINT-specific threat vectors in order to specify security-related requirements.  Once the requirements are identified, methods and solutions how to achieve such requirements can be selected.</t></abstract>
