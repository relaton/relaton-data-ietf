<abstract><t>This document analyzes a set of solution candidates which have been proposed to mitigate some of the issues encountered when address sharing is used.  In particular, this document focuses on means to reveal the origin of an IP packet when a Carrier Grade NAT is involved in the path.  The ultimate goal is to assess the viability of proposed solutions and hopefully to make a recommendation on the more suitable solution(s).</t></abstract>
