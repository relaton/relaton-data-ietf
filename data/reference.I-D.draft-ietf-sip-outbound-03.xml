<abstract><t>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate TCP connections and send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in order to deliver requests. However, many practical considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and Network Address Translators (NATs), prevent servers from connecting to User Agents in this way. Even when a proxy server can open a TCP connection to a User Agent, most User Agents lack a certificate suitable to act as a TLS (Transport Layer Security) server. This specification defines behaviors for User Agents, registrars and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent. It also defines keep alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections.</t></abstract>
