<abstract><t>A major responsibility of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) servers is to provide application-layer routing.  SIP routing can be quite complex and lead to similarly complicated paths that SIP requests traverse on the way to their actual destinations.  It is therefore important to be in position to troubleshoot errors that occur along a SIP path, inside and outside troubleshooters' administrative domains. Particularly important for the troubleshooters is knowledge of where an error occurred in a SIP path.  This document introduces a new header field called Debug.  The purpose of the header field is to convey extra debugging information that can be used to locate errors in SIP implementations involved in processing of a SIP transaction.</t></abstract>
