<abstract><t>This document describes the air interface of the Metropolitan Beacon System (MBS) system.  MBS provides a high precision, reliable, consistent positioning system indoors and in urban canyons, where GNSS solutions are degraded or denied.  In addition to the high 2-D accuracy, the MBS system architecture also provides for high resolution and accuracy in the vertical dimension, with the aid of embedded sensors.  MBS technology provides a very fast time to first fix (TTFF), on the order of ~6 seconds under cold start conditions.  Similar to GNSS, MBS technology allows computation of the location on the device without any network dependence thus enabling a wide variety of standalone applications.</t></abstract>
