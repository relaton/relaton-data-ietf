<abstract><t>A deterministic network is one that can carry data flows for real- time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency.  Deterministic networks have been successfully deployed in real-time operational technology (OT) applications for some years (for example [ARINC664P7]).  However, such networks are typically isolated from external access, and thus the security threat from external attackers is low.  IETF Deterministic Networking (DetNet) specifies a set of technologies that enable creation of deterministic networks on IP-based networks of potentially wide area (on the scale of a corporate network) potentially bringing the OT network into contact with Information Technology (IT) traffic and security threats that lie outside of a tightly controlled and bounded area (such as the internals of an aircraft).  These DetNet technologies have not previously been deployed together on a wide area IP-based network, and thus can present security considerations that may be new to IP- based wide area network designers.  This draft, intended for use by DetNet network designers, provides insight into these security considerations.  In addition, this draft collects all security- related statements from the various DetNet drafts (Architecture, Use Cases, etc) into a single location Section 7.</t></abstract>
