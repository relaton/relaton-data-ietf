<abstract><t>As IP networks grow more complicated, these networks require a new interaction mechanism between customers and their networks based on intent rather than detailed specifics.  An intent-based language is need to enable customers to easily describe their diverse intent for network connectivity to the network management systems.  This document describes the problem Intent-Based NEtwork Modelling (IB- NEMO) language is trying to solve, a summary of the use cases that demonstrate this problem, and a proposed scope of work.  Part of the scope is the validation of the language as a minimal (or reduced) subset.  The IB-NEMO language consists of commands exchanged between an application and a network manager/controller.  Some would call this boundary between the application and the network management system as northbound interface (NBI).  IB-NEMO focuses on creating minimal subset of the total possible Intent-Based commands to pass across this NBI.  By creating a minimal subset (about 20% of the total possible) of all intent commands, the IB-NEMO can be a simple Intent interface for most applications (hopefully 80%).  Part of validation of this command language is to to provide test cases where a set of commands are used to convey information for a use case which result in a particular data model in the network controller.</t></abstract>
