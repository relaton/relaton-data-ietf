<abstract><t>This document provides an applicability statement for the use of UDP transport checksums when used with IPv6.  This defines recommendations and requirements for use of IPv6 UDP datagrams with a zero checksum.  It examines the role of the IPv6 UDP transport checksum, as defined in RFC2460 and presents a summary of the trade- offs for evaluating the safety of updating RFC 2460 to permit an IPv6 UDP endpoint to use a zero value in the checksum field as an indication that no checksum is present.  This method is compared with some other possibilities.  The document also describes the issues and design principles that need to be considered when UDP is used with IPv6 to support tunnel encapsulations.  XXX NOTE - This revision is a partial response to comments received during IESG review.  There are additional comments to be incorporated - and updates anticipated to the related PS that updates IPv6.  This is therefore an interim version.  XXX</t></abstract>
