<abstract><t>In order to enhance the policy provisioning and QoS guarantees, policy  monitoring and context learning facilities are used. This document is focussed on facilities for monitoring and learning of context integrated in autonomous policy management system for enhanced user-centric Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in heterogeneous Internet environment. The autonomous policy management includes components aimed at automation of QoS policy specification, provisioning and adaptation based on common policy repository. Integration of monitoring and context learning facilities allows to consider measurement and context data for more efficient policy provisioning and adaptation. The goal is to collect measurement and context information, in order to support automated policy decision and adaptation of actor's policies, when specific events (patterns) are detected in a given network context.</t></abstract>
