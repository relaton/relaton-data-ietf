<abstract><t>With significantly longer IPv6 address prefixes assigned to ISPs, operators sometimes find opportunities to assign special meaning to lower-order bit patterns.  Often, these bit patterns cannot be expressed as an address prefix.  This RFC introduces IPv6 Address/Mask notation that allows one to express address groupings beyond "all addresses that share a single prefix".  The notation is similar to the IPv4 Address/Mask notation in its expressiveness, but its syntax is derived from the traditional Address/Prefix-length notation.  The traditional Address/Prefix- length notation is a special case of the Address/Mask notation.  For example, using this notation, both 2001:db8::/32 and 2001:db8::/ ffff:ffff:: have the same meaning.  However, the following requires the new notation: 2001:db8::1234/ffff:ffff::ffff or, equivalently, 2001:db8::1234/32+::ffff.</t></abstract>
