<abstract><t>This document discusses different types of explicit cross-layer signaling and notification mechanisms that have been proposed to enhance end-to-end transport performance. We analyze the different mechanisms in a framework based on what level of network support they require, and discuss the benefits and disadvantages different approaches have. The objective is to get a common understanding of the problem space, with pointers to past discussions on this topic, and to describe the possible next steps towards removing barriers from explicit cross-layer communication in future protocols.</t></abstract>
