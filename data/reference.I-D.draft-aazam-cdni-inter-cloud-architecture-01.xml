<abstract><t>Rapidly increasing digital media has triggered the importance of cloud computing. Cloud    computing provides ease of management and ubiquitous access facility to the growing digital content. The ratio with which digital content has been increasing, it now requires multiple clouds to interoperate for the purpose of scalability, efficient service provisioning, and better management. This scenario is known as inter-cloud computing or cloud federation. On the other hand, increase in multimedia content requires much better service provisioning, responsiveness, and efficient transcoding. Thoroughly designing the architecture of Media Cloud Inter-Cloud Computing is today's requirement. This document focuses on this important issue and presents architectural fundamentals and key concerns in Media Inter-Cloud Computing.</t></abstract>
