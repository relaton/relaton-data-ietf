<abstract><t>This document contains definitions for the different states that documents (viz. Internet-Drafts) may experience while associated with an IETF working group.  The first state occurs when an Internet Draft (I-D) is submitted for consideration as a working group item. The last state is either when the I-D is sent to the IESG for publication, or declared as "dead".  The purpose of this Internet-Draft is to serve as a basis for the definition of requirements to extend the IETF Datatracker tool so that the community may monitor the status and progression of I-Ds through IETF working groups.  For completeness, Appendix A has definitions for all of the I-D states which are already coded into the Datatracker.  These states describe the progression and status of I-Ds after they have been submitted to the IESG for publication.</t></abstract>
