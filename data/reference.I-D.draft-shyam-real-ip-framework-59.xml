<abstract><t>This document tries to propose an architectural framework of the internet in the real IP world. It describes how a three-tier mesh structured hierarchy can be established in a large address space based on fragmenting it into some regions and some sub regions inside each of them. It shows how to make a transition from private IP to real IP without making significant changes with the existing network. It introduces VLSM tree routing protocol. It introduces another protocol for host identification with provider independent address. With the useful works done through IPv6, it provides all necessary inputs based on which a specification of IP with 64 bit address space may be emerged.</t></abstract>
