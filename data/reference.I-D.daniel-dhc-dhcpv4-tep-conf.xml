<abstract><t>The intent of this draft is to provide a solution to automate tunnel end-point configuration for a configured IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel. This uses a DHCPv4 option to percolate the tunnel end-point configuration information. This is very useful to connect a newly deployed native IPv6 cloud to other existing IPv6 networks using IPv4 backbone as well as to connect isolated dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 nodes to IPv6 networks through IPv4.</t></abstract>
