<abstract><t>This document defines a new media type for the XML Shareable Playlist Format (XSPF, pronounced like "spiff"). XSPF allows playlists to be exchanged between different software, across networks and across administrative boundaries. A media type registration enhances shareability. An XSPF playlist describes a sequence of objects to be rendered in time. Objects might be audio, video, text, playlists, or any other media type with an inherent duration. The function of an XSPF document is to identify the objects and communicate their order.</t></abstract>
