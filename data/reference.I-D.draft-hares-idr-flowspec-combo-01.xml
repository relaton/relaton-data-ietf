<abstract><t>BGP flow specification (RFC5575) describes the distribution policy that contains filters and actions that apply when packets are received on a router with the flow specification function turned on. The popularity of these flow specification filters in deployment for DoS and SDN/NFV has led to the requirement for more BGP flow specification match filters in the NLRI and more BGP flow specification actions.  Two solutions exist for adding new filters: 1) expanding the BGP Flow Specification version 1 (NLRI match filters and extended communities actions) to included limited number of filters and actions, and 2) creating a BGP Flow Specification version 2 that allows for ordering filters and actions (using new NLRI and wide-communities for actions).  The two solutions can exist in parallel.  This document contains an overview existing proposals for expansion of BGP flow specification policy, proposals for BGP Flow Specification v1 and a new BGP Flow specification version 2 that supports order of filters and actions plus allowing more actions. This document also provides rules for the interaction of IDR Flow Specification policy (session ephemeral policy) with policy found in I2RS (reboot ephemeral policy), and policy found in ACLs and Policy routing (configuration policy).  This document does not contain the individual definitions of policy rule conditions or actions.</t></abstract>
