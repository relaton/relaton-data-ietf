<abstract><t>The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) transforms were designed to allow simple and efficient protection of RTP.  To provide this, encryption and authenticity of media and control signaling are tightly coupled to the RTP session, and to the information in the RTP header.  Hence, it is not possible to perform store and forward of protected media.  This document gives, based on a use case analysis, requirements that new SRTP transforms need to satisfy in order to allow independent media and transport protection.  A first proposal on how to implement such transforms in SRTP is also presented.</t></abstract>
