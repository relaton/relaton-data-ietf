<abstract><t>With the advent of Software-Defined Networking(SDN), the network environment has changed greatly to focus on users, and network virtualization technology has made great progress. However, networks that are getting bigger and more advanced have become more and more complex and difficult to use SDN. In such an environment, a network system that users can easily access and use is required. In this document we propose a more advanced policy-based network virtualization system that allows users to select policies and provide networks accordingly, rather than a system that simply virtualizes a network and shares it with each user.</t></abstract>
