<abstract><t>In commercial deployments Mobile IPv6 can be a service offered by a Mobility Services Provider (MSP). In this case all protocol operations may need to be explicitly authorized and traced, requiring the interaction between Mobile IPv6 and the AAA infrastructure. Integrating the AAA infrastructure offers also a solution component for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in integrated and split scenarios. This document describes various scenarios where a AAA interface for Mobile IPv6 is actually required. Additionally, it lists design goals and requirements for such an interface.</t></abstract>
