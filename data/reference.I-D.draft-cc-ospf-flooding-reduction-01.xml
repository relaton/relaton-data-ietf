<abstract><t>This document proposes an approach to flood OSPF link state advertisements on a topology that is a subgraph of the complete OSPF topology per underline physical network, so that the amount of flooding traffic in the network is greatly reduced, and it would reduce convergence time with a more stable and optimized routing environment.  The approach can be applied to any network topology in a single OSPF area, and can be used in both OSPFv2 ([RFC2328]) network and OSPFv3 ([RFC5340]) network.</t></abstract>
