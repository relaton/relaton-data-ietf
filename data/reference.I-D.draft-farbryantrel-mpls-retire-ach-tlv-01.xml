<abstract><t>The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization of the applicability of the Pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header (ACH).  RFC 5586 defines the concept of Type-Length-Variable (TLV) constructs that can be carried in messages on the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH.  No Associated Channel Type yet defined uses a TLV.  Furthermore, it is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces significant problems to the fast-path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to be processed substantially in hardware, the use of TLVs in undesirable.  This document updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the associated registry.</t></abstract>
