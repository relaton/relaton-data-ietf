<abstract><t>HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is a design for an HTTP authentication method with credentials that are not vulnerable to phishing attacks, and that does not require a server-side password database.  The design can also be used in Javascript-based authentication embedded in HTML.  HOBA is an alternative to HTTP authentication schemes that require passwords with all the negative attributes that come with password-based systems.  HOBA can be integrated with account management and other applications running over HTTP and supports portability, so a user can associate more than one device or origin-bound key with the same service.  We also describe a way in which the HOBA design can be used from a Javascript web client.  When deployed, HOBA will be a drop-in replacement for password-based HTTP authentication or JavaScript authentication.</t></abstract>
