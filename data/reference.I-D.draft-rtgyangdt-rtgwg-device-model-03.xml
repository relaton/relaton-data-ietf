<abstract><t>This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models in a comprehensive structure that may be used to configure and operate network devices.  The structure is itself represented as a YANG model, with all of the related component models logically organized in a way that is operationally intuitive, but this model is not expected to be implemented.  The identified component modules are expected to be defined and implemented on common network devices.  This document also defines two modules that can be used to model the logical and virtual resource representations that may be present on a network device.  Examples of common industry terms for logical resource representations are Logical Systems or Routers.  Examples of of common industry terms for virtual resource representations are Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances and Virtual Switch Instances (VSIs).  This document is derived from work submitted to the IETF by members of the informal OpenConfig working group of network operators and is a product of the Routing Area YANG Architecture design team.</t></abstract>
