<abstract><t>A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent (UA) does not always trust all intermediaries in its request path to inspect its message bodies and/or headers contained in its message.  The UA might want to protect the message bodies and/or headers from intermediaries, except those that provide services based on its content.  This situation requires a mechanism called &quot;end-to-middle security&quot; to secure the information passed between the UA and intermediaries, which does not interfere with end-to-end security.  This document defines a set of requirements for a mechanism to achieve end-to-middle security.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
