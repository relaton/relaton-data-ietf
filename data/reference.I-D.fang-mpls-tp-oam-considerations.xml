<abstract><t>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudo wire (PW) procedures as specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudo wire (PW) and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of a control plane.  This document is intended to explain the criticality of progressing the essential suite of MPLS-TP OAM solution elements in order to meet the urgent and increasing requirements for metro packet transport networks. It describes examples of key packet transport network applications for several operators, reviews associated MPLS-TP service provider requirements, and analyzes MPLS-TP OAM solution approaches that have been submitted to the IETF.  Based upon this, it is recommended that the solution elements described in draft-bhh- mpls-tp-oam-y1731 [6] be included within the MPLS-TP toolkit for supporting MPLS-TP OAM Functions, and that the draft be progressed as a Standards Track RFC.</t></abstract>
