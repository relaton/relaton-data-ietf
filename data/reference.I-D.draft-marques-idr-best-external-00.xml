<abstract><t>This document makes a case and provides the rules for a border router to advertise its best external route towards its IBGP peers when its overall best is a route received from an IBGP peer.  The best external route may be different from the overall best route installed in the Loc-Rib.  Advertising the best-external route (when different from the overall best route) into an IBGP helps in speeding up routing convergence, has positive effects in reducing inter-domain churn and in some limited scenarios could help avoid permanent IBGP route oscillation.  The document also extends this mechanism to route reflectors and confederation border routers to advertise a best route that is external to the cluster/domain.</t></abstract>
