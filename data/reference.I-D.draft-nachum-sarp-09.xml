<abstract><t>This document introduces SARP, an architecture that uses proxy gateways to scale large data center networks. SARP is based on fast proxies that significantly reduce switches' FDB table (MAC table) sizes and ARP/ND impact on network elements in an environment where hosts within one subnet (or VLAN) can spread over various locations. SARP is targeted for massive data centers with a significant number of VMs that can move across various physical locations.</t></abstract>
