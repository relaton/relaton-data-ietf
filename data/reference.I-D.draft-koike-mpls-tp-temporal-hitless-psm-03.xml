<abstract><t>The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable carrier-grade packet transport and complement converged packet network deployments. One of the most attractive features of MPLS-TP are OAM functions, which enable network operators or service providers to provide various maintenance characteristics, such as fault location, survivability, performance monitoring, and preliminary or in-service measurements.  One of the most important mechanisms which are common for transport network operation is fault location. A segment monitoring function of a transport path is effective in terms of extension of the maintenance work and indispensable particularly when the OAM function is effective only between end points. However, the current approach defined for MPLS-TP for the segment monitoring (SPME) has some fatal drawbacks.  This document elaborates on the problem statement for the path segment monitoring function. Moreover, this document requests to add network objectives to solve or improve the issues and proposes to consider a new improved method of segment monitoring.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</t></abstract>
