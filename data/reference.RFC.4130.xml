<abstract><t>This document provides an applicability statement (RFC 2026, Section 3.2) that describes how to exchange structured business data securely using the HTTP transfer protocol, instead of SMTP; the applicability statement for SMTP is found in RFC 3335.  Structured business data may be XML; Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in either the American National Standards Committee (ANSI) X12 format or the UN Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport (UN/EDIFACT) format; or other structured data formats.  The data is packaged using standard MIME structures.  Authentication and data confidentiality are obtained by using Cryptographic Message Syntax with S/MIME security body parts.  Authenticated acknowledgements make use of multipart/signed Message Disposition Notification (MDN) responses to the original HTTP message.  This applicability statement is informally referred to as &quot;AS2&quot; because it is the second applicability statement, produced after &quot;AS1&quot;, RFC 3335.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
