<abstract><t>This document describes the usage of Router Fingerprint Authentication (RFA) with public keys.  This can be used as a peer authentication method with KARP Key Management Protocol (KMP).  KARP KMP automates key negotiation for securing TCP-based pairwise Routing Protocols (RPs) like BGP, LDP.  The advantage of RFA is, neither it requires out-of-band, mutually agreeable symmetric keys nor a full PKI based system (trust anchor or CA certificates) for mutual authentication of the peers with KARP KMP deployments.  Usage of Router Fingerprints give a significant operational improvement from symmetric key based systems and yet provide a secure authentication technique.</t></abstract>
