<abstract><t>The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths ("MP LSPs") contains a field that identifies the address of a "root node".  Intermediate nodes are expected to be able to look up that address in their routing tables.  However, if the route to the root node is a BGP route, and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core, this is not possible.  This document specifies procedures which enable a MP LSP to be constructed through a BGP-free core.  In these procedures, the root node address is temporarily replaced by an address which is known to the intermediate nodes.</t></abstract>
