<abstract><t>This document discusses the requirements and procedures to achieve the multihoming of media for voice over IP sessions using the transport layer protocol as signaling Control Transmission Protocol.  Media is an essential part of any voice over IP session. SIP (RFC 3261) is a text based signaling protocol and Multihoming using SIP can be achieved by using the SCTP as a transport protocol (RFC 4168), therefore the application level resiliency can be guaranteed even in case of any middle node or terminal failures. But any voice over IP or multimedia session is nearly insignificant, if the media path is broken during a call and is waiting for a timeout which further shall lead to a call drop.A complete solution to Multihoming can be achieved if a system is capable of a performing the failovers  at both application and media plane and still maintaining the session irrespective of the application or media path failures or at least to detect a signaling or media path failure and terminate the session rather than waiting for timeouts. The requirement of Multihoming in media can also be derived from the fact that in any voice, video or data session, the signaling and call setup time use to be incomparably short than that of real media session at media plane. Therefore providing the resiliency at the signaling level does not provide the guaranteed and best effort service from a media session point of view as not only signaling but media is an integral part of it.</t></abstract>
