<abstract><t>This document discusses separation of subscriber-management control plane and data-plane for BNG. Traditionally, the BNG provides aggregation of fixed access nodes (such as DSLAM and OLTs) over Ethernet and provides subscriber management and traffic management functions for residential subscribers. The BNG has however evolved to become a multi-access edge device that also provides termination of subscribers over fixed-wireless and hybrid access. Therefore, this document proposes interfaces between control and user-plane of a BNG that can support multi-access BNG.</t></abstract>
