<abstract><t>Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of traffic engineering in Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and IP/MPLS net- works. In IP/MPLS networks, PCE provides MPLS LSP routes with con- straints. In GMPLS networks, PCE provides GMPLS LSP routes and optimal virtual network topology reconfiguration control, and jugdes on whether a new lower-region LSP should be established when a higher-region LSP is requested. PCE also handles interworking between GMPLS and IP/MPLS net- works, both of which will coexist at some point during the migration process.</t></abstract>
