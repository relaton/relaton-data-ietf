<abstract><t>This document describes methodologies that have been designed to improve and facilitate IETF document flow processing. It specifies a set of procedures under which a working group chair or secretary serves as the primary Document Shepherd for a document that has been submitted to the IESG for publication. Before this, the Area Director responsible for the working group has traditionally filled the shepherding role. A Document Shepherd's responsibilities include: o Providing the Document Shepherd Write-Up accompanying a document that is forwarded to the IESG when publication is requested. o During AD Evaluation by the Responsible Area Director, managing the discussion between the editors, the working group, and the Responsible Area Director. o During IESG evaluation, following up on all IESG feedback ("DISCUSS" and "COMMENT" items) related to the shepherded document. o Following up on IANA and RFC Editor requests in the post-approval shepherding of the document. In summary, a Document Shepherd continues to care for a shepherded document during its post-WG lifetime just as he or she has cared for it while responsible for the document in the working group.</t></abstract>
