<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism for routers and switches in Spine-Leaf type topology to have non-reciprocal Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing relationships between the leafs and spines.  The leaf nodes do not need to have the topology information of other nodes and exact prefixes in the network.  This extension also has application in the Internet of Things (IoT).</t></abstract>
