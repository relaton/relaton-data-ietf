<abstract><t>This document extends the OAuth 2.0 framework to include a simple query language that can be used by clients to request certain claims from an authorization server.  This mechanism can be used during the authorization request and refresh request.  It also defines a response parameter of the token and introspection endpoints that indicates to the caller which claims were authorized by the resource owner.  Lastly, it stipulates how this request parameter can be used during token exchange, and how clients may request that certain claims be placed in an access token intended for a particular resource server.</t></abstract>
