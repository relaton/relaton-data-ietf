<abstract><t>This document specifies, abstractly, how to interface applications and transport protocols with IPsec so as to create "channels" by "latching" "connections" (packet flows) to certain IPsec Security Association (SA) parameters for their lifetime. This can be used to protect applications against accidentally exposing live packet flows to unintended peers, whether as the result of a reconfiguration of IPsec or as the result of using weak peer identity to peer address associations. Weak association of peer ID and peer addresses is at the core of Better Than Nothing Security (BTNS), thus connection latching can add a significant measure of protection to BTNS IPsec nodes. Latched connections also represent IPsec channels, a building block for channel binding to IPsec; channel binding adds an additional level of protection to applications using BTNS IPsec, and IPsec in general.</t></abstract>
