<abstract><t>This document discusses several possible mechanisms of SNMP engine discovery when SSH is deployed as transport mapping for SNMP. The document proposes a discovery mechanism using UDP transport and User Based Security Model(USM) with a feature of SSH host key distribution. The mechanism tries to reduce discovery cost and in the same time improve SSH host key distribution efficiency. The draft is in "discussion" nature. Maybe there is text that is implementation-related, but the author believes it was not specific to a certain implementation.</t></abstract>
