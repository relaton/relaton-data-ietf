<abstract><t>This document describes and discuss the text encodings of Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates, PKIX Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), PKCS #10 Certification Request Syntax, PKCS #7 structures, Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), PKCS #8 Private- Key Information Syntax, and Attribute Certificates.  The text encodings are well-known, are implemented by several applications and libraries, and are widely deployed.  This document is intended to articulate the de-facto rules that existing implementations operate by, and to give recommendations that will promote interoperability going forward.</t></abstract>
