<abstract><t>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used by anyone on the Internet to route a request to that specific UA instance. A URI which routes to a specific UA instance is called a Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU). An Internet-Draft is progressing toward standardization that specifies procedures for proxies and UAs by which proxies can construct and delver GRUUs to UAs that request them. This document summarizes for UA implementors how to obtain "public" GRUUs and gives guidance on effectively using public GRUUs.</t></abstract>
