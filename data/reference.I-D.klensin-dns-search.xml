<abstract><t>This memo discusses strategies for supporting 'DNS searching' -- finding of names in the DNS, or references that will ultimately point to DNS names, by a mechanism layered above the DNS itself that permits fuzzy matching, selection that uses attributes or facets, and use of descriptive terms. Demand for these facilities appear to be increasing with growth in the Internet (and especially the web) and with requirements to move beyond the restricted subset of ASCII names that have been the traditional contents of DNS 'Class=IN'. This document proposes a three-level system for access to DNS names in which the upper two levels involve search, rather than lookup (exactly known target), functions. It also discusses some of the issues and challenges in completing the design of, and deploying, such a system.</t></abstract>
