<abstract><t>This draft proposes unified L2 abstractions for L3-driven fast handover. For efficient network communication, it is vital for a protocol layer to know or utilize other layer's information such as L2 triggers. However, in current operating systems, each protocol layer is designed independently and information exchange between protocol layers is not allowed. To solve the problem, this draft defines nine kinds of L2 abstractions in the form of "Primitive". This concept can be applied to L3-driven fast handover mechanism using "Primitives".</t></abstract>
