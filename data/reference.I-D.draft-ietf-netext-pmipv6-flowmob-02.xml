<abstract><t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  However, the ability of movement of selected flows from one access technology to another is missing in the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.  This document describes enhancements to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that are required to support network based flow mobility over multiple physical interfaces.  This document assumes that the mobile node implements the logical interface model, therefore allowing the support of traffic flows on different physical interfaces regardless of the assigned prefixes on these physical interfaces.</t></abstract>
