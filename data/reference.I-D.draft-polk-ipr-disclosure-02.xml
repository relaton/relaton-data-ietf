<abstract><t>The disclosure process for intellectual property rights (IPR) in IETF stream documents is essential to the accurate development of community consensus.  However, this process is not always followed by participants during IETF standardization.  Regardless of the cause or motivation, noncompliance with IPR disclosure rules can derail or delay completion of standards documents.  This document describes strategies for promoting compliance with the IPR disclosure rules. The strategies are primarily intended for area directors, working group chairs, and working group secretaries.</t></abstract>
