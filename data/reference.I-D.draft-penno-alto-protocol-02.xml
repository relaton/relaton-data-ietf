<abstract><t>Applications already have access to great amount of underlying network topology information.  For example, views of the Internet routing table are easily available at looking glass servers and entirely practical to downloaded by clients.  What is missing is network side information such as the network preference information -- what an ISP or Content Provider actually prefers -- and a way to distribute it.  The ALTO Service provides information such as preferences of network resources with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance. This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service. While such service would primarily be provided by the network (i.e., the ISP), content providers and third parties could also operate this service.  Applications that could use this service are those that have a choice in connection endpoints.  Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</t></abstract>
