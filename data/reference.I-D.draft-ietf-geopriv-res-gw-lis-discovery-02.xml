<abstract><t>The residential gateway is a device that has become an integral part of home networking equipment.  Discovering a Location Information Server (LIS) is a necessary part of acquiring location information for location-based services.  However, discovering a LIS when a residential gateway is present poses a configuration challenge, requiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented by the gateway.  This document describes a solution to this problem.  The solution provides alternative domain names as input to the LIS discovery process based on the network addresses assigned to a Device.</t></abstract>
