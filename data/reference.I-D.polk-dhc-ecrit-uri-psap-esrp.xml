<abstract><t>This document defines a new Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHC) Option for client requesting and/or receiving a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or Emergency Services Routing Proxy (ESRP) URI to be used by higher layer protocols during emergency calling. In some network models, an ESRP URI and a PSAP URI will be equivalent from the client's point of view, therefore this document purposely vague differentiating between the two, as the difference does not matter to DHCP.</t></abstract>
