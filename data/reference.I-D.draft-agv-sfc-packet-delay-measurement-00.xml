<abstract><t>Service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the capability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet Delay.  The common reasons for packet delay are Nodal processing(Algorithmic, Packetization etc...), Queuing, Transmission delay, Propagation delay and Service Function processing delay.  Packet Delay Measurement capability also provides operators with greater visibility into the performance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting, and network performance evaluation.  This document specifies best possible efficient and accurate mechanism for passive packet delay measurement for Service Function Chains (SFCs) for a SFC network domain.</t></abstract>
