<abstract><t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) currently supports grouping media lines.  SDP also has semantics defined for grouping the associated source and Forward Error Correction (FEC)-based repair flows.  However, the existing specifications have strict requirements that severely limit the use of the new features that are currently under development in the FECFRAME WG.  These new features will allow applications to use FEC in a more flexible way but they require changes in the current specifications.  This document provides a list of the required changes and discusses potential approaches to make these changes.</t></abstract>
