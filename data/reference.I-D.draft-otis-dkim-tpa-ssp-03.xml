<abstract><t>TPA-SSP (DKIM Third-Party Authorization for Sender Signing Practices) is a DNS-based label prefix mechanism for authorizing Third-Party domains.  This mechanism allows a first-party domain to autonomously authorize a range of third-party domains in a scalable, individual DNS transaction.  This authorization can extend the scope of DKIM-SSP policy assertions and eliminate more difficult to administer mechanisms.  Alternatives for facilitating third-party authorizations currently necessitate coordination between two domains by setting up selector/key DNS records, DNS zone delegations, or the regular exchange of public/private keys.  Checking Sender Signing Practices occurs when a From header email- address is not within the domain of a valid DKIM signature.  When a Third-Party signature is found, TPA-SSP offers an efficient means for the email address domain within the From header to specifically authorize other third-party signing domains.  The scope of the authorization may also assert identity authentication for Sender and Resent-* headers for email-addresses within the signing domain. Identity authentication within the From header domain may be asserted by the scope of the authorization, even when signed by a Third-Party domain.  In addition, the RFC2821.MailFrom domain can authorize domains for controlling DSNs.</t></abstract>
