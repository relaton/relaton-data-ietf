<abstract><t>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam and attach to different access networks without disrupting the ongoing sessions that nodes of the network may have.  By extending the Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile Routers, nodes of the network are not required to support any kind of mobility, since packets must go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional tunnel. Communications from/to a mobile network have to traverse the Home Agent, and therefore better paths may be available.  Additionally, this solution adds packet overhead, due to the encapsulation.  There are currently a set of well defined NEMO Route Optimization requirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration, from which solutions should be based on.  This document analyses how the problem of NEMO RO for Aeronautics Mobile Networks might be tackled, in a way as generic as possible, trying to identify those open questions and deployment considerations that need to be addressed.  The main goal of this document is to foster the discussion about aeronautics NEMO RO solution space within the MEXT WG.</t></abstract>
