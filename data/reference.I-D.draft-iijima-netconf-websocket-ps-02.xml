<abstract><t>This memo proposes a way of transporting NETCONF over WebSocket protocol.  Web-based applications are increasing with the advancement of Web technologies and emergence of cloud computing.  Management systems that support browser-based interface are getting common. It's natural to expect network devices to have browser-based managemaent interface.  Currently, however, few network management protocols support the transportation over HTTP.  Although NETCONF[RFC6241] was defined to be sent over SOAP/HTTPS[RFC4743], it can not realize notification mechanism[RFC5277] over SOAP/HTTPS since HTTP lacks bi-directional capabilty.  But now, WebSocket protocol, the update of HTTP with bi-directional capability, is available[RFC6455].  This memo describes the way NETCONF is sent over WebSocket protocol.</t></abstract>
