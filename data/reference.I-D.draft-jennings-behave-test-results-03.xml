<abstract><t>IETF has several working groups that are considering the impact of NATs on various protocols. Having a classification of the types of NATs that are being developed and deployed is useful in gauging the impact of various solutions. This draft records the results of classifying NATs. This draft is not complete and has only a few test results but it is worth discussing all the testing we wish to do before all the test results are collected. The test results here are very old and work is being done to update them with more current information.</t></abstract>
