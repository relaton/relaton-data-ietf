<abstract><t>IPsec encapsulation can be used to provide a secure channel between two entities, to enforce controlled access to a network, or to provide any combination of integrity protection, confidentiality, replay protection, and traffic flow confidentiality of data being transmitted between two or more endpoints over untrusted transmission media or networks. Whereas various assortments of the protections are possible to provide, it is not always safe to use some of the combinations. Next, IPsec SAs are established either manually or using a key management protocol such as IKEv2 with entity authentication verified locally or with the assistance of a third party. This document specifies when and how to use IPsec and IKEv2 and what combinations of protections afforded by those protocols are safe and when.</t></abstract>
