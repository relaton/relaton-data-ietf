<abstract><t>This document captures the requirements for the client-facing interface to security controller.  The interfaces are based on user- intent instead of developer-specific or device-centric approaches that would require deep knowledge of specific products and their security features.  The document identifies the requirements needed to enforce the user-intent based policies onto network security functions (NSFs) irrespective of how those functions are realized. The function may be physical or virtual in nature and may be implemented in networking or dedicated appliances.</t></abstract>
