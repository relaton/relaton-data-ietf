<abstract><t>Edge RBridges currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and their egress RBridges by observing the data packets traversed through. When an ingress RBridge receives a data frame with its destination address (MAC&amp;VLAN) unknown, the data frame is flooded within the VLAN across the TRILL campus. When there are more than one RBridge ports connected to one bridged LAN, only one of them can be designated as the Appointed Forwarder port for forwarding/receiving native traffic to/from each VLAN, the other RBridge ports on that LAN have to be disabled for native traffic in that VLAN.  This draft describes the framework for using directory services to assist edge RBridges by reducing multi-destination frames, particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, improving TRILL network scalability in environment, such as data centers.</t></abstract>
