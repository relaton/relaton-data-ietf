<abstract><t>Quantum computing is the study of computers that use quantum features in calculations.  For over 20 years, it has been known that if large- scale quantum computers could be built, they could have a devastating effect on classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and elliptic curve signatures and key exchange, as well as on encryption algorithms.  There has already been a great deal of study on how to create algorithms that will resist large-scale quantum computers, but so far, the properties of those algorithms make them onerous to adopt before they are needed.  Small-scale quantum computers are being built today, but it is still far from clear when large-scale quantum computers that can be used to break classical algorithms with key sizes commonly used today will be available.  It is important to be able to predict when large-scale quantum computers usable for cryptanalysis will be possible so that organization can change to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms well before they are needed.  This document describes quantum computing, how it can be used to attack classical cryptographic algorithms, and possibly how to predict when large-scale quantum computers will become feasible.</t></abstract>
