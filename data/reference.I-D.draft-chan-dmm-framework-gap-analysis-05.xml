<abstract><t>This document introduces a framework for analyzing mobility management protocols in terms of their key abstracted logical functions.  The framework is capable of presenting a unified view, reducing the clutter that obscures a casual reader from understanding the commonalities between different approaches in mobility management.  More importantly, a first order application of this framework allows us to examine previously standardized mobility management protocols, such as MIPv6 and PMIPv6 (as well as several of their extensions), and describe their core functionality in terms of different configurations of the logical functions defined by the framework.  As a result, we can use the framework to analyze the gaps between the protocols needed in a distributed mobility management environment and the functionality provided by the current generation of mobility management protocols.  Our analysis points to the need for a re-configuration of logical functions identified in the framework as well as the need for new extensions which can make distributed mobility management possible in the future.</t></abstract>
