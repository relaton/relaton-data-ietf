<abstract><t>This document establishes a set of extended SMTP policy codes for anti-spam.  It seeks to provide additional codes for error texts that currently use the extended SMTP error code 5.7.1.  The anti-spam codes were determined by looking at error texts produced by major ISPs and finding commonalities.  The result is a new set of error texts with associated extended SMTP error codes.</t></abstract>
