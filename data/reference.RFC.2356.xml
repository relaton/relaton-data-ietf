<abstract><t>The Mobile IP specification establishes the mechanisms that enable a mobile host to maintain and use the same IP address as it changes its point of attachment to the network.  The mechanisms described in this document allow a mobile node out on a public sector of the internet to negotiate access past a SKIP firewall, and construct a secure channel into its home network.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</t></abstract>
