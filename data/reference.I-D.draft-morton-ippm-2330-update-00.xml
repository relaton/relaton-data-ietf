<abstract><t>To obtain repeatable results in modern networks, test descriptions need an expanded stream parameter framework that also augments aspects specified as Type-P for test packets.  This memo proposes to update the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework with advanced considerations for measurement methodology and testing.  The existing framework mostly assumes deterministic connectivity, and that a single test stream will represent the characteristics of the path when it is aggregated with other flows.  Networks have evolved and test stream descriptions must evolve with them, otherwise unexpected network features may dominate the measured performance.  This memo describes new stream parameters for both network characterization and support of application design using IPPM metrics.</t></abstract>
