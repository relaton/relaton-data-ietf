<abstract><t>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) has been developed by the IETF to facilitate the establishment of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in a variety of physical technologies and across several architectural models. The ITU-T has specified an architecture for the management of Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON). This document provides a lexicography for the interpretation of GMPLS terminology within the context of the ASON architecture. It is important to note that GMPLS is applicable in a far wider set of contexts than just ASON. Thus the definitions presented in this document do not provide exclusive or complete interpretations of the GMPLS concepts. The intention of this document is simply to allow the GMPLS terms to be applied within the ASON context.</t></abstract>
