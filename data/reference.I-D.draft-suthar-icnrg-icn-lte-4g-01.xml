<abstract><t>Mobile networks using LTE, 4G technologies are complex. Managing mobility and content delivery using IP transport is challenging and not optimized for content delivery. IP unicast routing from server to clients is used for delivery of multimedia content to User Equipment (UE), where each user gets separate stream. From bandwidth and routing perspective this approach is inefficient. Multicast and broadcast technologies have emerged recently for mobile networks, but their deployments are very limited or at an experimental stage due to complex architecture and radio spectrum issues. ICN is a rapidly emerging technology with built in features for efficient multimedia content delivery, however majority of the work is focused either on fixed networks or unlicensed WiFi-based wireless networks. The main focus of this document is on native deployment of ICN in cellular mobile networks by embedding ICN into 3GPP protocol stack at IP datagram or replacing IP for non-IP datagrams. ICN has an inherent capability for anchorless mobility, security and it is optimized for content delivery using local caching at the edge. We believe that ICN native or dual stack (with IP) deployment will bring all inherent benefits and help in optimizing mobile networks.</t></abstract>
