<abstract><t>This document is concerned with security vulnerabilities in the ISATAP and 6to4 tunnels.  These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to take advantage of inconsistencies between a tunnel's overlay IPv6 routing state and the native IPv6 routing state.  The attacks form routing loops which can be abused as a vehicle for traffic amplification to facilitate DoS attacks.  We describe these security vulnerabilities and the attacks which exploit them.  We further recommend on solutions to remove the vulnerabilities.</t></abstract>
