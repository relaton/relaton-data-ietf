<abstract><t>This document discusses mechanisms for Mobile IPv6 allowing the efficient establishment of bidirectional link layer connectivity of mobile receivers moving to access networks with unidirectional links. Scenarios are derived from the need to support seamless mobile in heterogeneous networking environment including unidirectional downstream link interfaces, such as DVB-H, DVB-T, DVB-S or satellites. In order to establish quickly the upstream connectivity of a mobile receiver, when moving to downstream unidirectional network in MIPv6 environment, the Link-Layer Tunneling Mechanisms defined in RFC 3077 are used in interaction with Mobile IPv6 protocols.</t></abstract>
