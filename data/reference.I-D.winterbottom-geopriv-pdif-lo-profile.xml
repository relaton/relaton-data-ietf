<abstract><t>The GeoPriv PIDF-LO specification provides a flexible and versatile means to represent location information. There are, however, circumstances that arise when information needs to be constrained in how it is represented so that the number of options that need to be implemented in order to make use of it are reduced. There is growing interest in being able to use location information contained in a PIDF-LO for message and call routing applications. For such applications to interoperate successfully location information will need to be normative and more constrained than is currently described in the PIDF-LO specification. This paper makes recommendations on how to constrain, represent and interpret locations in a PIDF-LO. It further looks at existing communications standards that make use of geodetic information for routing purposes and recommends a subset of GML that MUST be implemented by applications to allow message routing to occur.</t></abstract>
