<abstract><t>Vulnerabilities with Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the need for a solid and secure firmware update mechanism that is also suitable for constrained devices.  Incorporating such update mechanism to fix vulnerabilities, to update configuration settings as well as adding new functionality is recommended by security experts.  This document lists requirements and describes an architecture for a firmware update mechanism suitable for IoT devices.  The architecture is agnostic to the transport of the firmware images and associated meta-data.</t></abstract>
