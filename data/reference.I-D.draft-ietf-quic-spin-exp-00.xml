<abstract><t>This document specifies the addition of a latency spin bit to the QUIC transport protocol and describes how to use it to measure end- to-end latency.  Note to Readers  This document specifies an experimental delta to the QUIC transport protocol.  Specifically, this experimentation is intended to determine:  o  the impact of the addition of the latency spin bit on implementation and specification complexity; and  o  the accuracy and value of the information derived from spin bit measurement on live network traffic.  The information generated by this experiment will be used by the QUIC working group as input to a decision about the standardization of the latency spin bit.  Although this is a Working Group document, it is currently NOT a Working Group deliverable.  Discussion of this draft takes place on the QUIC working group mailing list (quic@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=quic [1].  Working Group information can be found at https://github.com/quicwg [2]; source code and issues list for this draft can be found at https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/labels/-spin [3].</t></abstract>
