<abstract><t>In non-packet transport networks, there are requirements where the Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme needs to employ a restoration Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping resources for the working and/or protecting LSPs reserved in the network after the failure occurs.</t><t>This document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided using Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in the context of a GMPLS end-to-end recovery scheme when using restoration LSP where failed LSP is not torn down.  In addition, this document discusses resource sharing-based setup and teardown of LSPs as well as LSP reversion procedures.  No new signaling extensions are defined by this document, and it is strictly informative in nature.</t></abstract>
