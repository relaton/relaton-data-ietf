<abstract><t>This document describes a method for HTTP to support optional on- demand headers as an addition to HTTP dialogs. Any server side application using this method will be able to request additional headers from conforming HTTP clients. This way the HTTP protocol will is extended to support optional on-demand headers that can be sent from clients uppon request. It can also serve as an intermediate step for introducing new HTTP headers without initialy requiring that they will always be sent. An additional HTTP header is described and its ABNF description is provided.</t></abstract>
