<abstract><t>An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a push service using the described technique.  This identification information can be used by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server to a single entity. This can used to reduce the secrecy for push subscription URLs by being able to restrict subscriptions to a specific application server.  An application server is further able to include additional information that the operator of a push service can use to contact the operator of the application server.</t></abstract>
