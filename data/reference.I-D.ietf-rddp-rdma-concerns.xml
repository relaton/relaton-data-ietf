<abstract><t>This draft describes technical concerns that should be considered in the design of standardized RDMA and DDP protocols/mechanisms for use with Internet transport protocols. This draft was written to provide input to the proposed new Remote Direct Data Placement (rddp) WG, and is not intended for publication as an RFC. This is an updated and resubmitted version of draft-ietf-rddp-rdma- concerns-00.txt to make it available for current discussions of mandatory-to-implement security in the RDDP WG. Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 5 are of particular relevance to that discussion.</t></abstract>
