<abstract><t>this document is used to update the former version 00 of draft-liu-mpls-tp-p2mp-share-protection-00. according to protection Requirements in RFC 5654 and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-survive-fwk WG draft. there are the following requirements : requirement 69 : MPLS-TP MUST support sharing of protection resources such that protection paths that are known not to be required concurrently can share the same resources.another requirment 67B : MPLS-TP must support unidirectional 1:n protection for P2MP ,so this document will describle and provide two protection solutions to protect P2MP path when there is a failure in the p2mp path.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t></abstract>
