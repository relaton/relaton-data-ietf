<abstract><t>Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the users of network services.  This document surveys a set of recommendations about the maximum latency tolerated by the users of delay-constrained services.  Some recommendations already exist for VoIP, but emerging services as e.g. online gaming, have different requirements.  Different papers in the literature reporting these constraints are surveyed, and a summary of the latency limits for each service is finally provided.</t></abstract>
