<abstract><t>The QUIC transport protocol [QUIC-TRANSPORT] preserves its future extensibility partly by specifying its version number.  There will be a relatively small number of published version numbers for the foreseeable future.  This document provides a method for clients and servers to negotiate the use of other version numbers in subsequent connections.  If a sizeable subset of QUIC connections use this mechanism, this should prevent middlebox ossification around the current set of published version numbers and the contents of QUIC Initial packets.</t></abstract>
