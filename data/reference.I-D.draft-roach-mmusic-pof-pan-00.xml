<abstract><t>Whenever two hosts have the ability to set up and control a session on a peer-to-peer basis, situations can arise in which both parties attempt to change session parameters "at the same time," such that the session control messages cross on the wire.  When this happens, implementations need to invoke extraordinary procedures to return the shared state of the session to a common view between the endpoints.  For real-time communications, these session control messages are typically exchanged using the session description protocol (SDP), using an Offer/Answer model.  This document expands the offer/answer model to include the ability to exchange information relating to discrete media streams within the session.  By reducing the amount of session data, the frequency of session state conflicts can be reduced; and, for certain types of operations, conflicts can be eliminated altogether.  This document updates RFC 3264.</t></abstract>
