<abstract><t>This document describes a protocol for automating the process of creating Network Address Translation (NAT) port mappings. Included in the protocol is a method for retrieving the public IP address of a NAT gateway, thus allowing a client to make this public IP address and port number known to peers that may wish to communicate with it. This protocol is implemented in current Apple products including Mac OS X, Bonjour for Windows, and AirPort wireless base stations.</t></abstract>
