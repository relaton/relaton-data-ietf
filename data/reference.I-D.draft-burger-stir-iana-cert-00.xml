<abstract><t>This document defines an IANA registry that maps country codes to secure telephone identity (STIR) root certificates authorized to create signing certificates for telephone numbers under the authority of a given country.  Some countries allow carriers to block unsolicited, automatically generated nuisance calls commonly known as 'robocalls.'  The use of signed STIR tokens in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) may be useful in such scenarios to provide positive attestations as to call origin.  Legacy telephone numbering resources are administrated by national policy.  Unlike the market-driven use case of Web commerce, some nations may restrict the list of STIR root certificate authorities acceptable for issuing signing certificates for STIR tokens that provide attestations for their local legacy telephone numbering resources.  The registry described in this document enables call recipients in a first country to validate that signaling it receives from a caller with a telephone number claiming to be in a second country conforms to the second country's policy of (1) having a limited list of STIR root certificate authorities (or not) and (2) the certificate that produced the signature over the signaling is signed by one of those authorized STIR root certificate authorities.</t></abstract>
