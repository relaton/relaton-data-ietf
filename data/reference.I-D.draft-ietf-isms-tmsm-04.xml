<abstract><t>This document describes a Transport Subsystem, extending the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) architecture defined in RFC 3411. This document describes a subsystem to contain transport models, comparable to other subsystems in the RFC3411 architecture. As work is being done to expand the transport to include secure transport such as SSH and TLS, using a subsystem will enable consistent design and modularity of such transport models. This document identifies and discusses some key aspects that need to be considered for any transport model for SNMP. This memo also defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for managing models in the Transport Subsystem.</t></abstract>
