<abstract><t>Traffic analysis is used by various entities to derive "meta data" about Internet communications, such as who communicates with whom or what, and when.  We analyze how meta-data can be extracted by monitoring IP headers, DNS traffic, and clear-text headers of commonly used protocols.  We then propose a series of actions that would make traffic analysis more difficult.</t></abstract>
