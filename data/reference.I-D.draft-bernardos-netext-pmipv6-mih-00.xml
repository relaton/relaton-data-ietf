<abstract><t>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6 enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without changing the IP address.  PMIPv6 also provides limited multi-homing support to multi-mode mobile devices.  While the basic scenario addressed by PMIPv6 considers MNs with just one interface, PMIPv6 also allows an MN to connect to the same PMIPv6 domain through different interfaces.  This limited support of multi- interfaced MNs is not fully specified, since the MAG needs to obtain/ guess additional information from the MN, in order to decide whether to treat an MN's interface attachment as a handover or as new interface attachment (i.e. meaning the creation of a new mobility session and, therefore, the allocation of new home network prefixes to the MN).  The use of IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) Services may help in obtaining this additional information.  This I-D describes how PMIPv6 would work in an 802.21-enabled scenario, and in particular, analyzes how MIH primitives can be used to help the MAG deal with multi-technology scenarios.</t></abstract>
