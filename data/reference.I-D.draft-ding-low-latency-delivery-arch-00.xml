<abstract><t>Demand for Ultra high-Reliability and Low-latency Communication (URLLC) and Broadband Assured IP Services (BAS) will grow as new service scenarios like 5G, IoT, AR/VR, Cloud are deployed.  As these new service scenarios will typically rely on shared packet infrastructure like Internet, methods to ensure URLLC and BAS performance across the underlying network resources will be required. This document outlines the motivation and key requirements for URLLC or BAS connectivity across heterogeneous network domains.  It also outlines the corresponding models and architecture required for providing orchestrated URLLC or BAS communication.</t></abstract>
