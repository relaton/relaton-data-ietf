<abstract><t>This Glossary provides definitions, abbreviations, and explanations of terminology for information system security. The 305 pages of entries offer recommendations to improve the clarity of Internet Standards documents (ISDs) and to make them more easily understood by international readers. The recommendations follow the principles that ISDs should (a) use the same term or definition whenever the same concept is mentioned; (b) use terms in their plainest, dictionary sense; (c) use terms that are already well-established in open publications; and (d) avoid terms that either favor a particular vendor or favor a particular technology or mechanism over other, competing techniques that already exist or could be developed.</t></abstract>
