<abstract><t>Efforts to design an internationalization model for electronic mail frequently encounter situations in which an internationalized message -- perhaps one containing some headers with characters coded in UTF-8 -- must be converted and transported over a traditional, 7-bit infrastructure. This document provides a specification, building on the design of message/rfc822, for encapsulating messages with internationalized headers and/or body part content types. This specification is one of a group intended to provide a modified and extended email environment for fully internationalized email. If approved, it is expected to update the discussion of 'message/' content types in RFC 2046.</t></abstract>
