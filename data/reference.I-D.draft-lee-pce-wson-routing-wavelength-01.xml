<abstract><t>This memo provides application-specific requirements and protocol enhancements for the Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for the support of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON). Lightpath provisioning in WSONs requires a routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process.  From a path computation perspective, wavelength assignment is the process of determining which wavelength can be used on each hop of a path and forms an additional routing constraint to optical light path computation. Different computational architectures for the RWA process are given and the PCEP extensions needed to support these architectures are defined.</t></abstract>
