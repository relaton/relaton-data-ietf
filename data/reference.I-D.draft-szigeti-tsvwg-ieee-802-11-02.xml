<abstract><t>As internet traffic is increasingly sourced-from and destined-to wireless endpoints, it is crucial that Quality of Service be aligned between wired and wireless networks; however, this is not always the case by default.  This is due to the fact that two independent standards bodies provide QoS guidance on wired and wireless networks: specifically, the IETF specifies standards and design recommendations for wired IP networks, while a separate and autonomous standards- body, the IEEE, administers the standards for wireless 802.11 networks.  The purpose of this document is to propose a set Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to IEEE 802.11 User Priority (UP) mappings to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by these two standards bodies, and, as such, to optimize wired-and-wireless interconnect QoS.</t></abstract>
