<abstract><t>[I.D-ietf-nvo3-framework] discusses using Dynamic data plane learning or control plane protocol to build and maintain the mapping tables and deliver encapsulated packets to their proper destination. However, there is no relevant work to discuss how those capabilities can be realized in details at the NVEs.  This document goes into details to discuss how MAC address learning works through data plane and control plane.</t></abstract>
