<abstract><t>For C-ACC, Platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, how to establish direct IP communication paths between neighbor vehicles poses two issues : how to discover the neighbor vehicle and the nearby service (from the upper layer); how to discover the link-layer address of the selected vehicle (from the lower layer).  This draft aims to solve these problems based on mDNS.</t></abstract>
