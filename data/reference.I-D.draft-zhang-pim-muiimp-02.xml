<abstract><t>In this document, followed by the idea mentioned in [1] and subsequently  updated  in  [2],  an  IGMP/MLD  proxy  with  multiple upstream interfaces called MUIIMP is proposed and analyzed. The MUIIMP inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy but extends with multiple upstream interfaces. To avoid data redundancy, each upstream interface of an MUIIMP device MUST NOT send or subscribe to the same data simultaneously.</t></abstract>
