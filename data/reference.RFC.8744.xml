<abstract><t>This document describes the general problem of encrypting the Server Name Identification (SNI) TLS parameter. The proposed solutions hide a hidden service behind a fronting service, only disclosing the SNI of the fronting service to external observers. This document lists known attacks against SNI encryption, discusses the current &quot;HTTP co-tenancy&quot; solution, and presents requirements for future TLS-layer solutions. </t><t>In practice, it may well be that no solution can meet every requirement and that practical solutions will have to make some compromises.</t></abstract>
