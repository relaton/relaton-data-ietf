<abstract><t>In the 802.16 Per-MS interface prefix model, one prefix can only be assigned to one interface of a mobile station by an access router and different mobile stations can't share a prefix.  Managing Per-MS interface prefixes is likely to increase the processing load at the access router.  Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique in which the access router offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes to an DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile station to the DHCPv6 server.  The access router next advertises the prefix information to the mobile station with a Router Advertisement message.  When the mobile station hands off, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server.  We also describe how AAA servers can help in prefix delegation.</t></abstract>
