<abstract><t>Some IPv6 applications obtain IPv4 address literals and want to communicate with those IPv4 hosts through an IPv6/IPv4 translator. The IPv6 application can send an IPv6 packet through the translator if it knows the IPv6 prefix of the IPv6/IPv4 translator.  In many IPv6/IPv4 translation deployments, that IPv6 prefix is not fixed; rather, the prefix is chosen by the network operator.  This specification provides three methods for a host to learn the IPv6 prefix of its IPv6/IPv4 translator.  Unicast, any-source multicast (ASM), and source-specific multicast (SSM) are supported.</t></abstract>
