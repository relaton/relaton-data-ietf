<title>RObust Header Compression (ROHC): Context Replication for ROHC Profiles</title>
<author initials='G.' surname='Pelletier' fullname='G. Pelletier'><organization /></author>
<date year='2005' month='August' />
<abstract><t>This document defines context replication, a complement to the context initialization procedure found in Robust Header Compression (ROHC), as specified in RFC 3095.  Profiles defining support for context replication may use the mechanism described herein to establish a new context based on another already existing context. Context replication is introduced to reduce the overhead of the context establishment procedure.  It may be especially useful for the compression of multiple short-lived flows that may be occurring simultaneously or near-simultaneously, such as short-lived TCP flows.
