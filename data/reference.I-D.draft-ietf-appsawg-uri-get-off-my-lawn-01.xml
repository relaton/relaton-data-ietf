<abstract><t>Sometimes, it is attractive to add features to protocols or applications by specifying a particular structure for URIs (or parts thereof).  However, publishing standards that mandate URI structure is inappropriate because the structure of a URI needs to be firmly under the control of its owner, and the IETF (as well as other organisations) should not usurp this ownership.  This document is intended to prevent this practice (sometimes called "URI Squatting") in standards, but updating RFC3986 to indicate where it is acceptable.</t></abstract>
