<abstract><t>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for inter-domain SIP federation.  ViPR hybridizes the PSTN, P2P networks, and SIP, and in doing so, addresses the phone number routing and VoIP spam problems that have been a barrier to federation.  The ViPR architecture uses a server, the ViPR server, which performs P2P and validation services on behalf of call agents, which acts as clients to the server.  Such an architecture requires a client/server protocol between call agents and the ViPR server.  That protocol, defined here, is called the ViPR Access Protocol (VAP).</t></abstract>
