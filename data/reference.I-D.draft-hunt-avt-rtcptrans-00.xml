<abstract><t>This memo addresses RTCP reporting by and through RTP translators. It collects existing guidance from RFC 3550, systematises translators' reporting behaviour by considering potential sources of information and the policy-controlled forwarding of such information, considers naming issues in labelling reports, considers methods of control of reporting behaviour, and presents some examples of architectures for reporting.</t></abstract>
