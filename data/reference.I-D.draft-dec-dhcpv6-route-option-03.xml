<abstract><t>This document describes the DHCPv6 Route Option for provisioning IPv6 routes on a DHCPv6 client.  This is expected to improve the ability of an operator to configure and influence a client's ability to pick an appropriate route to a destination when this client is multi-homed to routers and where other means of route configuration may be impractical.  The option is primarily envisaged for configuring a broadband Residential Gateway (RG) router, but is generic enough to be used by other types of DHCPv6 clients.</t></abstract>
