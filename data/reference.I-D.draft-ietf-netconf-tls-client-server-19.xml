<abstract><t>This document defines three YANG modules: the first defines groupings for a generic TLS client, the second defines groupings for a generic TLS server, and the third defines common identities and groupings used by both the client and the server.  It is intended that these groupings will be used by applications using the TLS protocol.

Change Log  Note to Reviewers (To be removed by RFC Editor)  This document presents a YANG module or modules that is/are part of a collection of drafts that work together to produce the ultimate goal of the NETCONF WG: to define configuration modules for NETCONF client and servers, and RESTCONF client and servers.  The relationship between the various drafts in the collection is presented in the below diagram.  crypto-types ^      ^ /        \ /          \ trust-anchors        keystore ^     ^              ^  ^ |     +---------+    |  | |               |    |  | |       +------------+  | tcp-client-server     |      /        |       | ^    ^        ssh-client-server    |       | |    |           ^            tls-client-server |    |           |              ^     ^        http-client-server |    |           |              |     |                 ^ |    |           |        +-----+     +---------+       | |    |           |        |                     |       | |    +-----------|--------|--------------+      |       | |                |        |              |      |       | +-----------+    |        |              |      |       | |    |        |              |      |       | |    |        |              |      |       | netconf-client-server       restconf-client-server   Full draft names and link to drafts:  o  draft-ietf-netconf-crypto-types (html [1])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-trust-anchors (html [2])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-keystore (html [3])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server (html [4])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-ssh-client-server (html [5]) o  draft-ietf-netconf-tls-client-server (html [6])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-http-client-server (html [7])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-netconf-client-server (html [8])  o  draft-ietf-netconf-restconf-client-server (html [9])</t></abstract>
