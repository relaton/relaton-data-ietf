<abstract><t>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases on IP- based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. First, this document surveys use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  Second, it analyzes proposed protocols for IP-based vehicular networking and highlights the limitations and difficulties found on those protocols.  Third, it presents a problem exploration for key aspects in IP-based vehicular networking, such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, and Security &amp; Privacy.  For each key aspect, this document discusses a problem statement to evaluate the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques and requirements in IP-based vehicular networking.</t></abstract>
