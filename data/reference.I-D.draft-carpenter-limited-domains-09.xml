<abstract><t>There is a noticeable trend towards network requirements, behaviours and semantics that are specific to a limited region of the Internet and a particular set of requirements.  Policies, default parameters, the options supported, the style of network management and security requirements may vary.  This document reviews examples of such limited domains, also known as controlled environments, and emerging solutions, and includes a related taxonomy.  It then briefly discusses the standardization of protocols for limited domains. Finally, it shows the needs for a precise definition of limited domain membership and for mechanisms to allow nodes to join a domain securely and to find other members, including boundary nodes.</t></abstract>
