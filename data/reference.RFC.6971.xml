<abstract><t>This document specifies the Depth-First Forwarding (DFF) protocol for IPv6 networks, a data-forwarding mechanism that can increase reliability of data delivery in networks with dynamic topology and/or lossy links.  The protocol operates entirely on the forwarding plane but may interact with the routing plane.  DFF forwards data packets using a mechanism similar to a &quot;depth-first search&quot; for the destination of a packet.  The routing plane may be informed of failures to deliver a packet or loops.  This document specifies the DFF mechanism both for IPv6 networks (as specified in RFC 2460) and for &quot;mesh-under&quot; Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs), as specified in RFC 4944.  The design of DFF assumes that the underlying link layer provides means to detect if a packet has been successfully delivered to the Next Hop or not.  It is applicable for networks with little traffic and is used for unicast transmissions only.</t></abstract>
