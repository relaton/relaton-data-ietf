<abstract><t>The domain name system (DNS) is defined in literally dozens of different RFCs.  The terminology used by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and by operators of DNS systems, has sometimes changed in the decades since the DNS was first defined.  This document gives current definitions for many of the terms used in the DNS in a single document.  This document will be the successor to RFC 7719, and thus will obsolete RFC 7719.  It will also update RFC 2308.</t></abstract>
