<abstract><t>The goal of the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is to provide guidance to applications which have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, all of which are able to provide the desired resource.  The goal of the mechanisms specified in this document is to extend the existing solution, and provide basic attributes to each end terminal to make it network- aware.  These mechanisms introduce a way to directly transfer the guidance or costs using Network Location identifiers/PIDs, called CPIDs.  And the exisiting The proposed solution inherits the existing solution's architecture, messages, and other mechanisms.  It can be used as an independent solution or function together with other functions in the existing solution to provide guidance for different client and balance the workload on the server.  Additional details for the process will be provided in the next version of the draft.</t></abstract>
