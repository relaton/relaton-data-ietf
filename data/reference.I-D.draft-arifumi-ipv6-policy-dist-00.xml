<abstract><t>This document describes some practical usages of default address selection policy distribution mechanism defined in another document. Default address selection policies are originated by ISPs or by network administrators and are delivered to each end node. These policies are stored at end nodes in the form of default address selection policy table. This mechanism is effective in many cases, such as IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack environment and other multiple address environment. Every end node is guided by the policy in selecting an appropriate destination and source addresses.</t></abstract>
