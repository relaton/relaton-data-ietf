<abstract><t>IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that is unique on the link.  Nodes normally derive a link local address through the use of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) along with Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).  This document presents a method for a node to construct a link-local address that is assured to be unique on the link when the node has already received a delegated prefix.  This is through the construction of a link-local address format known as the AERO address.</t></abstract>
