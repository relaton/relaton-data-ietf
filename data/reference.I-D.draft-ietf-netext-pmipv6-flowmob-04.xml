<abstract><t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node to connect to the same Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain through different interfaces.  However, the ability of movement of selected flows from one access technology to another is missing in the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.  This document describes extensions to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that are required to support network based flow mobility over multiple physical interfaces.  The extensions required consist on the operations performed by the local mobility anchor and the mobile access gateway to manage the prefixes assigned to the different interfaces of the mobile node, as well as how the forwarding policies are handled by the network to ensure consistent flow mobility management.</t></abstract>
