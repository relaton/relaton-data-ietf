<abstract><t>This document specifies a new Hop-by-Hop IPv6 option that is used to record the minimum Path MTU along the forward path between a source host to a destination host.  This collects a minimum Path MTU recorded along the path to the destination.  The value can then be communicated back to the source using the return Path MTU field in the option.</t><t> This Hop-by-Hop option is intended to be used in environments like Data Centers and on paths between Data Centers, to allow them to better take advantage of paths able to support a large Path MTU.  The method could also be useful in other environments, including the general Internet.</t></abstract>
