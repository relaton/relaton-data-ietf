<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 as specified in RFC3775 [1] allows a mobile node to maintain its IPv6 communications while moving between subnets. This document investigates configurations where a mobile node running Mobile IPv6 is multihomed. The use of multiple addresses is foreseen to provide ubiquitous, permanent and fault-tolerant access to the Internet, particularly on mobile nodes which are more prone to failure or sudden lack of connectivity. However, Mobile IPv6 currently lacks support for such multihomed nodes. The purpose of this document is to detail all the issues arising through the operation of Mobile IPv6 on multihomed mobile nodes.</t></abstract>
