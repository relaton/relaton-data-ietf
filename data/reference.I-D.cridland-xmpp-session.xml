<abstract><t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) historically had a Session Establishment request defined in RFC 3921 which clients were required to perform at the beginning of a session.  RFC 6121 dropped this entirely.  This specification reinstates it as an optional no-op to aid backwards compability, matching commonly deployed workarounds.</t></abstract>
