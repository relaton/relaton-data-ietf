<abstract><t>This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based Internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing for generic point to multi-point (P2MP) networks, and in specifically Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON) interfaces, defined in IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004, which amends IEEE Std 802.3-2002. For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].</t></abstract>
