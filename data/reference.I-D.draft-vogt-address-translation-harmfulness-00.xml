<abstract><t>Address translation is widely considered harmful because its existing variants conflict with well-established design principles of the Internet engineering community.  Still, address translation has become common practice despite technical problems because it    constitutes an easy-to-deploy solution to a set of common operational needs.  Since some of these needs will continue to exist in IP version 6, there is concern within the Internet engineering community about the potential proliferation of harmful technology from IP version 4 to IP version 6.  This paper investigates these concerns. It analyzes feasible address translator designs, explains why the problems of address translation, as used today, are to a significant extent specific to IP version 4, and shows how the problems can be mitigated in IP version 6.</t></abstract>
