<abstract><t>The DNS has long been used to publish lists of IPv4 address ranges in blacklists and whitelists.  The size of the IPv6 address space makes the entry-per-IP approach used for IPv4 lists impractical.  A new technique for publishing IP address ranges is described.  It is intended to permit efficient publishing and querying, and to have good DNS cache behavior.</t></abstract>
