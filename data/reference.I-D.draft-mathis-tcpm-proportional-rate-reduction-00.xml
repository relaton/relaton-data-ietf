<abstract><t>This document describes a pair experimental algorithms, Proportional Rate Reduction (PPR) and Reduction Bound (RB) that improve the accuracy of the amount of data sent by TCP during loss recovery. Standard Congestion Control requires that TCP and other protocols reduce their congestion window in response to losses.  This window reduction naturally occurs in the same round trip as the data retransmissions to repair the losses, and is implemented by choosing not to transmit any data in response to some ACKs arriving from the receiver.  There are two widely deployed algorithms used to implement this window reduction: Fast Recovery and Rate Halving.  Both algorithms are needlessly fragile under a number of conditions, particularly when there is a burst of losses that such that the number of ACKs delivered is so small that the effective window falls below ssthresh, the target value chosen by the congestion control algorithm.  Proportional Rate Reduction avoids these excess window reductions such that at the end of recovery the actual window size will be as close as possible to the window size determined by the congestion control algorithm.  It is patterned after rate halving, but using the fraction that is appropriate for target window chosen by the congestion control algorithm.  In addition a second algorithm, Reduction Bound, monitors the total window reduction due to all mechanisms, including application stalls, the losses themselves and inhibits further window reductions when possible.</t></abstract>
