<abstract><t>TRILL facilitates loop free connectivity to non-TRILL networks via choice of an Appointed Forwarder for a set of VLANs. Appointed Forwarders provide load sharing based on VLAN with an active-standby model. High performance applications require an active-active load- sharing model. The Active-Active load-sharing model can be accomplished by representing any given non-TRILL network with a single virtual RBridge. Virtual representation of the non-TRILL network with a single RBridge poses serious challenges in multi- destination RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) check calculations. This document specifies required enhancements to build Coordinated Multicast Trees (CMT) within the TRILL campus to solve related RPF issues. CMT provides flexibility to RBridges in selecting desired path of association to a given TRILL multi-destination distribution tree. This document updates RFC 6325.</t></abstract>
