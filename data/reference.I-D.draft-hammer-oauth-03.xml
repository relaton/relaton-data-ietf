<abstract><t>This document specifies the OAuth Core 1.0 protocol.  OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of another party (such as a different client or an end user).  It also provides a redirection-based user agent process for end users to authorize access to another party by substituting their credentials (typically, a username and password pair) with a different set of delegation- specific credentials.  This document is based on revision A of the community specification and includes a few clarifications.</t></abstract>
