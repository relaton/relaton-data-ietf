<abstract><t>In this draft, we present what P2PSIP should achieve - a distributed location service. Then we compare the differences between C/S SIP and P2P SIP and point out that some features which are not standardized in C/S SIP should be addressed in the P2P SIP case. After analyzing some problems, some requirements of Peer protocol are proposed.</t></abstract>
