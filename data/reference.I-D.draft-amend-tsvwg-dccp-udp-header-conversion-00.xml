<abstract><t>The Datagram Congestion Control protocol (DCCP) is a non-widely deployed transport protocol in the Internet.  The reason for that is a typical chicken-egg problem.  Even if there would be a use for application developer to rely on DCCP, middle-boxes like firewalls and NATs will prevent DCCP end-to-end since they lack support for DCCP.  However, as long as the protocol penetration of DCCP will not increase, middle-boxes will not handle DCCP properly.  To overcome this challenge NAT/NATP traversal and UDP encapsulation for DCCP is already defined.  However the first requires special middle-box support and the latter introduces overhead.  The proposal of a multipath extension for DCCP further stresses the question of efficient middle-box passing as its main goal is to be applied over the Internet, traversing numerous uncontrolled middle-boxes.  This document introduces a new approach, disguising DCCP during transmission as UDP without requiring middle-box modification nor introducing any overhead.</t></abstract>
