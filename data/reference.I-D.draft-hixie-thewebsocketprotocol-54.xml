<abstract><t>The Web Sockets protocol enables two-way communication between a user agent running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code.  The protocol consists of an initial handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.  The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g. using XMLHttpRequest or &lt;iframe>s and long polling).Author's note  This document is automatically generated from the same source document as the HTML5 specification.
