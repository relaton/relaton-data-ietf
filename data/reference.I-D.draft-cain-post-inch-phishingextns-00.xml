<abstract><t>This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) to support the reporting of phishing, fraud, other types of electronic crime, and widespread spam incidents. These extensions are flexible enough to support information gleaned from activities throughout the entire electronic fraud cycle. Both simple reporting and complete forensic reports are possible, as is consolidated reporting of multiple phishing incidents. The extensions defined in this document are used to generate two different reports: a fraud and phishing report and a wide-spread spam report. Although similar in structure, each report has different required objects and intents. This document had completed working group last call and was in revision when the INCH working group was disbanded.</t></abstract>
