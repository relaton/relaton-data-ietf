<abstract><t>This document analyzes the problems and limitation of the current flat-structured Host Identity Tag (HIT, [RFC4423]) architecture. The document specifies a hierarchical HIT architecture which is compatible with the flat-structured HIT architecture. This architecture and the process of HITs generation ensure the global uniqueness of HITs. It also enables the multiple HIP management domains, solves the deployment problem of current flat-structured HIT architecture. It also enhances the scalability and resolution efficiency of the mapping system.</t></abstract>
