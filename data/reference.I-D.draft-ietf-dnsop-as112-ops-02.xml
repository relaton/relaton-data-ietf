<abstract><t>Many sites connected to the Internet make use of IPv4 addresses which are not globally unique.  Examples are the addresses designated in RFC1918 for private use within individual sites.  Devices in such environments may occasionally originate reverse DNS queries corresponding to those private-use addresses.  Since the addresses concerned have only local significance, it is good practice for site administrators to ensure that they are answered locally. However, it is not uncommon for such queries to follow the normal delegation path in the public DNS instead of being answered within the site.  It is not possible for public DNS servers to give useful answers to such queries.  In addition, due to the wide deployment of private-use addresses and the continuing growth of the Internet, the volume of such queries is large and growing.  The AS112 project aims to provide a distributed sink for such queries in order to reduce the load on the root and IN-ADDR.ARPA authority servers.  This document describes the steps required to install a new AS112 node, and offers advice relating to such a node's operation.</t></abstract>
