<abstract><t>This memo specifies two new algorithms.  One is the usage of Cipher- based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) with Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload and Authentication Header protocols.  This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-96.  Latter is pseudo-random function based on CMAC with Camellia block cipher for Internet Key Exchange.  This algorithm is called Camellia-CMAC-PRF-128.</t></abstract>
