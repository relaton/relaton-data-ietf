<abstract><t>IP is designed for use in Best Effort Networks, which are networks that provide no guarantee that data is delivered, or that delivery meets any specified quality of service parameters.  However there are new applications requiring IP to provide deterministic services in terms of bandwidth and latency, such as network based AR/VR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality), industrial internet.  This document proposes a solution in IPv6 that can be used by transport layer protocols to guarantee certain level of service quality.  This new service is fined-grained and could apply to individual or aggregated TCP/UDP flow(s).</t></abstract>
