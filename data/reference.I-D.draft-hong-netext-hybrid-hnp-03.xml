<abstract><t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) supports multihoming where a mobile node can connect to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple interfaces for simultaneous access or inter-technology handoff.  However, for an inter-technology handoff, PMIPv6 does not allow simultaneous access since all the home network prefixes associated with one interface are delivered to another interface of a mobile node.  In addition, if we assume that the flow is classified by home network prefix, then the PMIPv6 cannot support flow mobility since it requires moving just some home network prefixes between interfaces.  In this document, we propose a hybrid home network prefix assignment (HHNPA) scheme where both the static prefix model and the dynamic prefix model are used. By using these two different home network prefix models, it can support flow mobility that some home network prefixes are moved to another interface and some home network prefixes are remained at existing interface.</t></abstract>
