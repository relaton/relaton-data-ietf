<abstract><t>This memo describes the full set of notations needed to represent a text string in a Dial Sequence.  A Dial Sequence is normally composed of Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) elements, plus separators and additional &quot;actions&quot; (such as &quot;wait for dialtone&quot;, &quot;pause for N secs&quot;, etc.) which could be needed to successfully establish the connection with the target service:  this includes the cases where subaddresses or DTMF menu navigation apply.</t></abstract>
