<abstract><t>This document outlines the security requirements for a Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) overlay network.  It compares security difference between client/server (C/S) and P2P implementations of SIP, partitions the P2PSIP architecture into layers and analyzes the security issues in each layer and the security relationship among the layers.  This draft also describes the different security requirements related to different application scenarios as well as a minimal set of security requirements valid for all applications.  It also discusses open issues related to certain security threats for the P2PSIP architecture and its components.</t></abstract>
