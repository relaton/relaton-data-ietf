<abstract><t>This document describes new ECC groups for use in IKE [IKE] and IKEv2 [IKEv2] in addition to the Oakley groups included therein. These groups are defined to align IKE with other ECC implementations and standards, and in addition, many of them provide higher strength than the Oakley groups. It should be noted that this document is not self-contained. It uses the notations and definitions of [IKE] and IKEv2 [IKEv2].</t></abstract>
