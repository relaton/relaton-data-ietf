<abstract><t>This proposal provides a method to implement identifier to locator mapping in the datapath without the need to access an in-network mapping database or cache. Mappings are encoded in Firewall and Service Tickets (FAST) tickets as locator information. When a packet is sent by a mobile node, a ticket is attached that providers the locator to use in the return path. Peer nodes receive packets with these tickets, cache the tickets in a flow context, and then attach them to packets they send as reflected tickets. When a packet with a reflected ticket enters an identifier-locator domain, the ticket is parsed to extract the locator. That locator is then used to send the packet to the appropriate destination over a network overlay.</t></abstract>
