<abstract><t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters.  To ensure that the values used in these fields do not have conflicting uses, and to promote interoperability, their allocation is often coordinated by a central authority.  For IETF protocols, that role is filled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  To manage a given namespace prudently, IANA needs guidance describing the conditions under which new values should be assigned, as well as when and how modifications to existing values can be made.  This document defines a framework for the documentation of these guidelines by specification authors, in order to assure that the guidance given to IANA is clear and addresses the various issues that are likely in the operation of a registry.  This is the third edition, and obsoletes RFC 5226.</t></abstract>
