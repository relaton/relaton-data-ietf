<abstract><t>This document describes how we developed a SOAP-based NETCONF client and server.  In the case of using SOAP as a transport protocol of NETCONF, various kinds of development tools are available.  By making full use of those tools, developers' workloads are significantly reduced.  We developed an NMS (Network Management System) and network equipment that can deal with NETCONF messages sent over SOAP.  This document is aimed at providing knowledge about development guidelines gained from the implementation experience of a SOAP-based NETCONF client and server.</t></abstract>
