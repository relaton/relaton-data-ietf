<abstract><t>Several types of explicit cross-layer communication schemes have been proposed to enhance the transport protocol performance. However, various challenges with such schemes have been identified, for example concerning the interactions with the middleboxes and tunnels in the network. This document discusses different types of explicit cross-layer notification mechanisms that have been proposed to enhance end-to-end transport performance. We analyze the different mechanisms using a taxonomy based on what kind of network interactions they require, and discuss the benefits and disadvantages different approaches have. The objective is to get a common understanding of the possibilities and challenges with these mechanisms, with pointers to past discussions on this topic, and to describe the possible next steps towards removing barriers from explicit cross-layer communication in future protocols.</t></abstract>
