<abstract><t>There is a class of applications which benefit from using SIP to exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session establishment.  This information, known as call control UUI data, is a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the session, and utilized by an application accepting the session.  The syntax and semantics for the UUI data used by a specific application are defined by a UUI package.  This UUI data is opaque to SIP and its function is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI data, along with an extension mechanism.</t></abstract>
