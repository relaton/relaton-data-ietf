<abstract><t>This Internet Draft describes a new Standards Action BGP community, LAST_RESORT.  This community provides a simple and easily deployable solution to a certain class of BGP "wedgies".  Initial deployment is expected to be achieved by voluntary use in the network operator community-at-large. Long-term adoption via software enforcement of the community, will improve global behavior, and simplify router configurations.  The Standards Action range of communities (previously limited to the "well-known" communities) ensures that the expectation of (eventual) router support is reasonable.</t></abstract>
