<abstract><t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular, it describes a backward-compatible supplement to the View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for version 3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3) for use with the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) or other Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services to provide authorization of MIB database access, and defines objects for managing this supplement.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with session-oriented secure SNMP Transport Models that facilitate RADIUS authentication, such as the Secure Shell Transport Model.  Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at isms@ietf.org.</t></abstract>
