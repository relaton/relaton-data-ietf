<abstract><t>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.  Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMP Packet Too Big message or perform link-specific fragmentation (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below IPv6.  This latter category of links is often performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link-specific fragmentation to the point that it would be highly desirable to push the fragmentation burden back to the IPv6 source.  A common case that exhibits these link characteristics is seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels.  This document therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to support link adaptation avoidance.</t></abstract>
