<abstract><t>This document specifies the use of the Quick-Start mechanism by the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP).  DCCP is a transport protocol that allows the transmission of congestion-controlled, unreliable datagrams.  DCCP is intended for applications such as streaming media, Internet telephony, and online games.  In DCCP, an application has a choice of congestion control mechanisms, each specified by a Congestion Control Identifier (CCID).  This document specifies general procedures applicable to all DCCP CCIDs and specific procedures for the use of Quick-Start with DCCP CCID 2, CCID 3, and CCID 4.  Quick-Start enables a DCCP sender to cooperate with Quick-Start routers along the end-to-end path to determine an allowed sending rate at the start of a connection and, at times, in the middle of a DCCP connection (e.g., after an idle or application- limited period).  The present specification is provided for use in controlled environments, and not as a mechanism that would be intended or appropriate for ubiquitous deployment in the global Internet.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the  Internet community.</t></abstract>
