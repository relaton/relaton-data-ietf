<abstract><t>This document attempts to explain what level of support for Authority to Citizen type of Emergency Alerts the IEEE 802.11 specification defined protocol has. The IEEE 802.11 specification is evolving by defining new amendments to it, which are then rolled into the base spec. The 802.11u amendment, published in November 2010, contains support for Citizen to Authority type of Emergency Calls and Authority to Citizen type of Alerts. The -00 version of the draft is just the skeleton, to meet the deadline for -00 draft submissions, version -01 will have the details.</t></abstract>
