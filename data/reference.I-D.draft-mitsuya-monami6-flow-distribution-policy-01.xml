<abstract><t>The multiple care-of address registration protocol [1] provides a framework to maintain multiple virtual paths with its home agents. But it does not included a solution to define policies for flow distribution on the multiple paths and to share the polices. This document describes a schema fragment (a xml based data set) to define a flow distribution policy. A dynamic policy exchange method using SOAP is also introduced.</t></abstract>
