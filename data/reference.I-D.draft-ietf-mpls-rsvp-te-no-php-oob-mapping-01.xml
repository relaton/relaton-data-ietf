<abstract><t>Expires December 2008  [page 1]  Internet-Draft  draft-ietf-mpls-rsvp-te-no-php-oob-mapping-01.txt  There are many deployment scenarios which require Egress LSR to  receive binding of the RSVP-TE LSP to an application, and payload  identification, using some "out-of-band" (OOB) mechanism. This  document proposes protocol mechanisms to address this  requirement. The procedures described in this document are  equally applicable for point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-  multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.  Conventions used in this document  In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and  server respectively.</t></abstract>
