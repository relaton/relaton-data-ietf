<abstract><t>This document provides usage guidance for external Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs) in Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.3 as defined in RFC 8446.  It lists TLS security properties provided by PSKs under certain assumptions and demonstrates how violations of these assumptions lead to attacks.  It discusses PSK use cases, provisioning processes, and TLS stack implementation support in the context of these assumptions.  It provides advice for applications in various use cases to help meet these assumptions.  It also lists the privacy and security properties that are not provided by TLS when external PSKs are used.</t></abstract>
