<abstract><t>In an EVPN network, EVPN PEs provide VPN bridging and routing service to connected CE devices based on BGP EVPN control plane. At present, there is no PE-CE control plane defined for an EVPN PE to learn CE MAC, IP, and any other routes from a CE that may be distributed in EVPN control plane to enable unicast flows between CE devices. As a result, EVPN PEs rely on data plane based gleaning of source MACs for CE MAC learning, ARP/ND snooping for CE IPv4/IPv6 learning, and in some cases, local configuration for learning prefix routes behind a CE. A PE-CE control plane alternative to this traditional learning approach, where applicable, offers certain distinct advantages that in turn result in simplified EVPN operation.  This document defines a PE-CE control plane as an optional alternative to traditional non-control-plane based PE-CE learning in an EVPN network. It defines PE-CE control plane procedures and TLVs based on LSoE as the base protocol, enumerates advantages that may be achieved by using this PE-CE control plane, and discusses in detail EVPN use cases that are simplified as a result.</t></abstract>
