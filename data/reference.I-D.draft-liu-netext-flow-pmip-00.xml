<abstract><t>PMIPv6 is designed to provide network based mobility, it requrie no changes to the UE.  There are proposals to extend PMIPv6 to support flow mobility.  Flow mobility requries the UE and the network should have communication protocol to carry the flow control policies.  This paper proposes to use the IKE protocol to carry the flow control information between the UE and network.</t></abstract>
