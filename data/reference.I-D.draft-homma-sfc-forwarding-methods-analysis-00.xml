<abstract><t>Some working groups of the IETF and other Standards Developing Organizations are now discussing use cases of a technology that enables data packets to traverse appropriate service functions through networks.  This is called Service Chaining in this document. (Also, in Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV), a subject that forwarding packets to required service functions in appropriate order is called VNF Forwarding Graph.)  This draft does not focus only on SFC method, and thus, use the term "Service Chaining".  SFC may be one method to realize Service Chaining.  There are several Service Chaining methods to forward data packets to service functions, and the applicable methods will vary depending on the service/network requirements of individual networks.  This document presents the results of analyzing packet forwarding methods and path decision patterns for achieving Service Chaining. For forwarding data packets to the appropriate service functions, distribution of route infromation and steering data packets following the route infromation, are required.  Examples of route information are packet identifier and the routing configurations based on the identifier.  Also, forwarding functions are required to decide the path according to the route information.</t></abstract>
