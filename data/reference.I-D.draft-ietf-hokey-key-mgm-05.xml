<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism for delivering root keys from an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) server to another network server that requires the keys for offering security protected services, such as re-authentication, to an EAP peer.  The distributed root key can be either a usage-specific root key (USRK), a domain- specific root key (DSRK) or a usage-specific domain-specific root key (USDSRK) that has been derived from an Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) hierarchy previously established between the EAP server and an EAP peer.  The document defines a key distribution exchange (KDE) protocol using Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) that can distribute these different types of root keys and discusses its security requirements.</t></abstract>
