<abstract><t>Dissemination of the traffic flow specifications was first introduced in the BGP protocol via RFC 5575.  In order to distribute the flow specifications from PCE controller to network device without BGP protocol it is desirable to extend PCEP with flow specification information.  [I-D.li-pce-pcep-flowspec] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of flow specifications.  The extensions include the instantiation, updation and deletion of flow specifications.  Flow specifications downloaded to forwarding entries requires a reliable synchronization mechanism between the path computation clients (PCCs) and the PCE.  This draft specify the flow specification synchronization mechanism for managing of flow specification (FLOwSPEC-DB) at node (PCC) aligning with FLOWSPEC-DB at PCE on initial session UP or session flap and specifies the required Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions.</t></abstract>
