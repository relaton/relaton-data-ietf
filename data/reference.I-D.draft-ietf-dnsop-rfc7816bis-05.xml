<abstract><t>This document describes techniques called "QNAME minimisation" to improve DNS privacy, where the DNS resolver no longer always sends the full original QNAME to the upstream name server.  This document obsoletes RFC 7816.  This document is part of the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) Working Group.  The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is at &lt;https://framagit.org/bortzmeyer/rfc7816-bis>  NOTE FOR THE DNSOP WORKING GROUP: There is still much work to be done in this draft.  Future versions of this draft will contain descriptions of different minimisation implementation choices that have been made since the RFC 7816 first came out, as well as deployment experience.</t></abstract>
