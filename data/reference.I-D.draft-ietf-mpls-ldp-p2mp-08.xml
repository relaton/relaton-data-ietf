<abstract><t>This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) for the setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) and multipoint-to- multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  These extensions are also referred to as mLDP Multicast LDP. mLDP constructs the P2MP or MP2MP LSPs without interacting with or relying upon any other multicast tree construction protocol.  Protocol elements and procedures for this solution are described for building such LSPs in a receiver-initiated manner.  There can be various applications for P2MP/MP2MP LSPs, for example IP multicast or support for multicast in BGP/MPLS L3VPNs. Specification of how such applications can use a LDP signaled P2MP/ MP2MP LSP is outside the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
