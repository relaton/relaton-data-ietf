<abstract><t>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks.  MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath techniques.  Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations.  Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS can LSP can be carried over multipath links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSP.  This document describes the means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP.  The use of MPLS-TP LSP as a server layer for MPLS LSP is also discussed.</t></abstract>
