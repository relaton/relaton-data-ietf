<abstract><t>Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) is a generic mechanism to support global addressing across network zones where routing is based on a different address space.  With it, the end-to-end model, lost in IPv4 with the deployment of NATs, can be restored without losing services that NAT44s offer beyond address-space extension (private addressing, basic firewall, site multihoming, privacy protection, host-rooted subnets).  Global-address packets are encapsulated in local-address packets to traverse SAM zones, and global prefixes are statelessly mapped into local addresses.  For the IPv6-IPv4 coexistence period, port-restricted IPv4 addresses are used to extend the global IPv4 address space.</t></abstract>
