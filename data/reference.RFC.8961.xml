<title>Requirements for Time-Based Loss Detection</title>

<abstract><t>Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of congestion along a network path).  While many mechanisms have been designed to detect loss, ultimately, protocols can only count on the passage of time without delivery confirmation to declare a packet &quot;lost&quot;. Each implementation of a time-based loss detection mechanism represents a balance between correctness and timeliness; therefore, no implementation suits all situations.  This document provides high-level requirements for time-based loss detectors appropriate for general use in unicast communication across the Internet.  Within the requirements, implementations have latitude to define particulars that best address each situation.</t></abstract>
