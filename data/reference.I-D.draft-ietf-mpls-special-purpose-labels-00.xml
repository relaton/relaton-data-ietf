<abstract><t>Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes.  A block of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end, and are commonly called "reserved labels".  They will be called "special purpose labels" in this document.  As there are only 16 of these labels, caution is needed in the allocation of new special purpose labels, yet at the same time allow forward progress when one is called for. This memo defines some procedures to follow in the allocation and retirement of special purpose labels, as well as a method to extend the special purpose label space.  Finally, this memo renames the IANA registry for these labels to "Special Purpose MPLS Label Values", and creates a new one called the "Extended Special Purpose MPLS Label Values" registry.</t></abstract>
