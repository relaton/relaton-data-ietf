<abstract><t>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is an HTTP based protocol that makes managing identities in multi- domain scenarios easier to support through a standardized HTTP service.  In a SCIM environment, changes to resources may be requested by multiple parties.  As time goes by an interested subscriber may wish to be informed about resource state changes that are occurring at the SCIM service provider.  This specification defines a hub notification service that can be used to publish and distribute events to interested registered subscribers.</t></abstract>
