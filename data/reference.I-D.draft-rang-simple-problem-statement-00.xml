<abstract><t>SIMPLE based presence systems today require a unique dialog to be established between every unique presentity-watcher pair. Even though some optimizations have been suggested to the protocol, in cases where many users within a domain are subscribed to a number of users in another domain, the number of subscriptions between domains quickly becomes an issue. This document examines the scaling issue and concludes that additional optimizations are necessary. It also suggests an initial list of requirements for these optimizations.</t></abstract>
