<abstract><t>This document analyses the applicability of Multipath TCP to wireless access networks with overlapping coverage area, and it discusses potential protocol extensions that aim to improve operation in such environments.  The analysis attempts to identify use cases, benefits as well as technical and functional obstacles encountered in the current version of the protocol.  Based on this analysis, recommendations are made on feature-, signaling- and policy extensions that promise to enhance Multipath-TCP's value, versatility and market acceptance in wireless access networks.</t></abstract>
