<abstract><t>Pre-Congestion notification (PCN) is a technique for maintaining QoS for inelastic flows in a DIFFServ domain.  The PCN architecture requires that egress nodes send reports of congestion-related events reliably to a policy decision point.  The policy decision point might be located in different places of the network.  In one architectural variant the policy decision point is a central node rather than co- located with the ingress or the egress nodes of the network.  In this case it needs to have access to certain information from the edge nodes.  This memo defines a Diameter application to support the ingress and the egress node to interact with the Diameter server acting as a policy decision point.</t></abstract>
