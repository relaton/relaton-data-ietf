<abstract><t>This document describes the application of multi-segment pseudowires (MS-PWs) in a Passive Optical Network (PON).  Static configuration of at least one PW segment is a typical case for a MS-PW.  This is often one of the end segments and, in the case of mobile backhaul, it is the segment closest to the aggregation device. But, when MS-PW is implemented in a PON, there may be a very large number of PW Terminating Provider Edge nodes (T-PEs).  This makes provisioning a heavy burden for the network manager.  Making use of a Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network (GPON) management protocol helps to reduce the labor of configuration, simplify and speed up the PW provision procedure to a great extent, and notify to switching PE (S-PE) (which is the Optical Line Termination node (OLT)) of the status of the AC at the T-PE (which is the Optical Network Unit (ONU)).  This document describes how to end-to-end MPLS MS-PWs can be provided through the integration of MPLS and GPON provisioning and control protocols, and describes how the MPLS-PW can be carried by the link layer of the GPON.</t></abstract>
