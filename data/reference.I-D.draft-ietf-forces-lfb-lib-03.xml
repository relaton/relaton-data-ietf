<abstract><t>This document defines basic classes of Logical Function Blocks (LFBs) used in the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES).  It is defined according to ForCES FE model [RFC5812] and ForCES protocol [RFC5810] specifications.  These basic LFB classes are scoped to meet requirements of typical router functions and considered as the basic LFB library for ForCES.  Descriptions of individual LFBs are presented and detailed XML definitions are included in the library. Several use cases of the defined LFB classes are also proposed.</t></abstract>
