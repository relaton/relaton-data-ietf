<abstract><t>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP, refered to as "L3VPN Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", that can be used to perform L3VPN address-prefix-based route filtering. This ORF-type supports prefix-length- or range-based matching, wild- card-based address prefix matching, as well as the exact address prefix matching for L3VPN address families.  The L3VPN Address Prefix ORF is applicable in the Virtual Subnet context.</t></abstract>
