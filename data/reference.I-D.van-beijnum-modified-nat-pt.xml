<abstract><t>A smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires that either all hosts are upgraded to dual stack before the first hosts can become IPv6- only, or that there be some mechanism for IPv6-only hosts to talk to IPv4-only hosts.  Expecting the former within a reasonable timeframe isn't realistic, based on current adoption of dual stack combined with the latest projections for the IPv4 depletion that point to a date early in the next decade.  And the IETF has recently deprecated the main mechanism that allows the latter: NAT-PT. This document proposes modifications to NAT-PT that address the reasons why the mechanism was deprecated.  This should allow future deployment of the modified NAT-PT as an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanism, giving operators the option of running their networks largely IPv6-only.</t></abstract>
