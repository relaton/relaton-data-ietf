<abstract><t>Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an extension to DS-Lite which moves the Network Address Translation function from the DS-Lite AFTR to the B4.  It can be deployed in a DS-Lite network to gradually reduce the load of Carrier Grade NAT in the AFTR.  However, when DS-Lite and lw4over6 co-exist in the same network, B4 elemtns and lwB4 elements may want to signal the DHCPv6 server the type of AFTR (i.e.  AFTR or lwAFTR) they request.  In this memo, a new DHCPv6 option is proposed for lwB4 element to request the IPv6 address of its corresponding lwAFTR.</t></abstract>
