<abstract><t>This specification defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol for allowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-of address for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneously establish multiple Mobile IP tunnels with its home agent.  This essentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the available network interfaces and build an higher aggregated data pipe with the home agent for its home address traffic.  Furthermore, these extensions also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiate flow policies for binding individual traffic flows with the registered care-of addresses.</t></abstract>
