<abstract><t>Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have been creating paradigm shifts across major service providers, governments, and industries. In recent years, these two novel frameworks created jitters and excitements across major academic institutions and communities of practice. While these are considered disruptive to major network infrastructures operating on status quo, SDN and NFV nonetheless bring network resiliency, scalability, manageability, and, most importantly, lower long-term operational expenditures when implemented properly.  They create opportunities for  innovation that engage key players from networks, security, and software to develop new controllers, APIs, networks, and technologies. However, new innovations come with associated risks and security issues.  This document aims to propose a formal security architecture that overarches important aspects of SDN and NFV 's frameworks. This architecture, which is considered first to be proposed thru this draft, can be elaborated and modified as the frameworks mature over time.</t></abstract>
