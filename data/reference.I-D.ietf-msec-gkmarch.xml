<abstract><t>This document defines the common architecture for Multicast Security (MSEC) key management protocols that support a variety of application, transport, and network layer security protocols. It also defines the group SA (GSA), and describes the key management protocols that help establish a GSA. The framework and guidelines described in this document allow for a modular and flexible design of group key management protocols for a variety of different settings that are specialized to applications needs. MSEC key management protocols may be used to facilitate secure one-to-many, many-to-many, or one-to-one communication.
