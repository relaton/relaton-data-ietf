<abstract><t>This document discusses solutions for inter-connection of BGP MPLS IP/VPN [RFC4364] and Data Center (DC) overlay networks. Two categories of inter-connections are discussed in this document. In the first category, Data Center overlay virtual network is built with BGP IP VPN technologies, the inter-connection of IP VPN in the Data Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN enables end-to-end IP VPN connectivity. New Inter-AS solutions are required in certain scenarios, in addition to the existing Inter-AS Options (A, B, C) defined in [RFC4364]. In the second category, Data Centers overlay network uses non IP VPN technologies, the inter-connection of any overlay virtual network in the Data Center to BGP IP VPN in the WAN provides end user connectivity through stitching of different overlay technologies, the mapping of non IP VPN overlay to IP VPN need to be performed at the border Gateway of the two networks. The role of Software Defined Network (SDN) to assist the inter-connections is discussed.</t></abstract>
