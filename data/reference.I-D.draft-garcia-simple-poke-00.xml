<abstract><t>This document specifies a message content type and XML format to request attention from a targeted user.  This feature is usually known as poke, nudge or buzz in existing messaging platforms.  Its primary use is as an additional instant messaging capability that can be sent in the middle of a instant messaging session or in a standalone message at any time.  This message also allows the sender to indicate the preferred realization of the attention request: vibrator, light, tone, media or text.</t></abstract>
