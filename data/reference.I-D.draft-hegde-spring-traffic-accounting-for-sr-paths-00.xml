<abstract><t>Traffic statistics form an important part of operations and maintenance data that are used to create demand matrices and for capacity planning in networks.  Segment Routing (SR) is a source routing paradigm that uses stack of labels to represent a path.  The SR path specific state is not stored in any other node in the network except the head-end node of the SR path.  Traffic statistics specific to each SR path are an important component of the data which helps the controllers to lay out the SR paths in a way that optimizes the use of network resources.  SR paths are inherently ECMP aware.  As SR paths do not have state in the core of the network, it is not possible to collect the SR path traffic statistics accurately on each interface.  This document describes an MPLS forwarding plane mechanism to identify the SR path to which a packet belongs and so facilitate accounting of traffic for MPLS SR paths.  The mechanisms described in this document may also be applied to other MPLS paths (i.e., Label Switched Paths) and can be used to track traffic statistics in multipoint-to-point environments such as those where LDP is in use.</t></abstract>
