<abstract><t>A mobile IPv6 node remains reachable when it moves in a IPv6 Internet. However, if such a node, i.e. MN, moves to a network which is protected by firewalls, the communication that is already existed before its moving may be blocked by firewall. The document presents a mechanism to update the corresponding access control entry of firewall to avoid the communication interrupted.</t></abstract>
