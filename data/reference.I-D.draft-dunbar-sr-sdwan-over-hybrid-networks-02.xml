<abstract><t>This document describes a method for end-to-end (E2E) SD-WAN paths (most likely encrypted) to traverse specific list of network segments, some of which are SR enabled and others may be IP networks that do not support SR, to achieve the desired optimal E2E quality.  The method described in this draft uses the principle of segment routing to enforce a SD-WAN path' head-end selected route traversing through a list of specific nodes of multiple network segments without requiring the nodes in each network segment to have the intelligence (or maintaining states) of selecting next hop or next domain. Those networks over which the SD-WAN path traverse have at least one SR enabled network, and some network segments (especially the last mile access portion) being existing IP networks (such as existing IPv4, IPv6 or others).</t></abstract>
