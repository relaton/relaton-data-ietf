<abstract><t>Current Internet protocols tend to be based on either X.509 based PKI, or Kerberos.  Both have limitations and age-related issues.  In this draft, we outline a possible approach to providing similar, and additional, functionality based on an abstract device that always signs whatever its given, and that may additionally annotate or modify its input in order to fulfill the security needs of other protocols.  This draft describes a SWIG service and how it can be used to conduct research into a number of important problems in Internet trust and identity management today.</t></abstract>
