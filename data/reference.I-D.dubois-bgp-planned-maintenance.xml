<abstract><t>To ease the maintenance of BGP-4 sessions and limit the amount of traffic that is lost during planned maintenance on routers, a specific mechanism is proposed in order to gracefully shutdown a router or a session. It's proposed that a router first withdraw its route to its peer to initiate their convergence. After a timer the router can proceed with the closing of the BGP sessions and consequently remove its peers'routes from it's RIB (Routing Information Base).</t></abstract>
