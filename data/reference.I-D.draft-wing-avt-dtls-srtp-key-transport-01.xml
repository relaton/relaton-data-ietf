<abstract><t>The existing DTLS-SRTP specification allows SRTP keys to be established between a pair of SRTP endpoints.  However, when there are more than two participants in an RTP session, DTLS-SRTP is unable to provide a single key for all of the participants.  This existing limitation of DTLS-SRTP prevents deploying DTLS-SRTP in certain scenarios.  This document describes an extension to DTLS-SRTP which transports SRTP keying material from one DTLS-SRTP peer to another, so the same SRTP keying material can be used by multiple DTLS-SRTP peers.  This extension reduces (and often eliminates) the need to key each SRTP session individually, allowing deployment of several DTLS-SRTP scenarios.</t></abstract>
