<abstract><t>This memo discusses policies that require certain labels to be inserted in the &quot;Subject:&quot; header of a mail message.  Such policies are difficult to specify accurately while remaining compliant with key RFCs and are likely to be ineffective at best.  This memo discusses an alternate, \%standards-compliant approach that is significantly simpler to specify and is somewhat less likely to be ineffective.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
