<abstract><t>This document describes detailed models for analysis of proposed protocols for Quality of Service (QoS) delivery with IPv4 (including multicast). The models have been developed using the OPNET simulation package. They are intended to allow investigation of performance using proposed protocols and should have wide applicability in the Internet QoS community. We are making these models publicly available with the intention that they can be used to provide expanded studies of Qos delivery for both unicast and multicast, using IntServ, DiffServ, and MPLS. This Internet-Draft is intended to form the basis for an Informational RFC that extends the previous RFC2490.</t></abstract>
