<abstract><t>When an emergency call is sent to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), the device that sends it, as well as any application service provider in the path of the call, or access network provider through which the call originated may have information about the call or the caller which the PSAP may be able to use.  This document describes data structures to convey such data to the PSAP.  In addition, data may also be included by reference, via a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) pointing to data found at an external resource.  Consequently, this document follows the tradition of prior emergency services standardization work where data can be conveyed by value within the call signaling (i.e., in body of the SIP message) and also by reference.</t></abstract>
