<abstract><t>Session Mobility is the seamless transfer of media of an ongoing communication session from one device to another. This document describes the general methods and specifies the flows for providing this service as part of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The basic steps involved in session mobility which are describe are service discovery to locate devices to use as transfer targets, for which the Service Location Protocol (SLP) is used, session transfer, and, sometimes, reconciliation of device capability differences. The described session mobility methods include the possibility of transferring any subset of the active media to one or more devices.</t></abstract>
