<abstract><t>This document describes work in progress in the MFA Forum on ATM and Frame Relay to MPLS Control Plane Interworking. Two specifications are being defined, one for client-server interworking (between two client network endpoints that communicate across an IP/MPLS network) and one for SPVC interworking (from a client network endpoint to an IP/MPLS network endpoint). Both client-server interworking and SPVC Interworking use standard PWE3 control for establishment of the pseudowires that transport the ATM or Frame Relay data connections across the IP/MPLS network. New AII type codepoints from the "Expert Review" range are requested. The need for these codepoints and proposed usage is described.</t></abstract>
