<abstract><t>In certain networks like financial information network (stock/ commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications, Latency (delay), Latency Variation (jitter) and Packet Loss is becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency Variation and Packet Loss is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service providers.  The Link Bandwidth Utilization (the total bandwidth of a link in current use for the forwarding) is also an important factor to consider during path computation.  IGP Traffic Engineering (TE) Metric extensions describes mechanisms with which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and IS-IS respectively.  The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.  This document describes the extension to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency Variation, Packet Loss, and Link Bandwidth Utilization as constraints for end to end path computation.</t></abstract>
