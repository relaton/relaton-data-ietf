<abstract><t>The IASA2 effort changes the terminology associated with several roles and the relationships among existing bodies and functions to the successors of others.  In some cases, the relevant earlier documents address other matters, including ones that are critical to IETF processes, and are better dealt with by updating the relevant terminology or provisions rather than attempting to replace the earlier documents in their entirety.  This document provides those updates for RFCs 2418 and 5377 [[and perhaps others in later versions]].</t></abstract>
