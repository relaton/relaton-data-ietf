<abstract><t>This Draft is intended as a standards track document, obsoleting RFC 1036, which itself dates from 1987. This Standard defines the format of Netnews articles and specifies the requirements to be met by software which originates, distributes, stores and displays them. Since the 1980s, Usenet has grown explosively, and many Internet and non-Internet sites now participate. In addition, the Netnews technology is now in widespread use for other purposes. Backward compatibility has been a major goal of this endeavour, but where this standard and earlier documents or practices conflict, this standard should be followed. In most such cases, current practice is already compatible with these changes.</t></abstract>
