<abstract><t>This document aims at analyzing the various design options and providing a set of recommendations for the design of Service Function Chaining solution(s).  Note:  o  The analysis does not claim to be exhaustive.  The list includes a preliminary set of potential solutions; other proposals can be added to the analysis if required.  o  The analysis is still ongoing.  The analysis text will be updated to integrate received comments and inputs.  o  Sketched recommendations are not frozen.  These recommendations are provided as proposals to kick-off the discussion and to challenge them.  o  The analysis does not cover any application-specific solution (e.g., HTTP header) because of the potential issues inherent to (TLS) encrypted traffic.  o  The analysis will be updated to take into account the full set of SFC requirements.</t></abstract>
