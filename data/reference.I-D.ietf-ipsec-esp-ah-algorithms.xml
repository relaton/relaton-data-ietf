<abstract><t>The IPSEC series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in order to provide security services. The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and the Authentication Header (AH) provide two mechanisms for protecting data being sent over an IPSEC Security Association (SA). To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations it is necessary to specify a set of mandatory to implement algorithms to ensure at least one algorithm that all implementations will have available. This document defines the current set of mandatory to implement algorithms for ESP and AH as well as specifying algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time.</t></abstract>
