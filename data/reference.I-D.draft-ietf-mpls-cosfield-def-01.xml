<abstract><t>The early MPLS documents defined the MPLS format, this definition includes three bit field called "EXP field".  The documentats leaves the exact description of how the EXP field should be used undefined, it is said said to be for "experimental use".  The EXP field has from the start been intended to be used for "Class of Service".  At the time the documents were published the use of such a CoS field were considered not to be defined well enough and the field were left for "Experimental use".  To avoid misunderstanding about how this field may be used this document re-introduces the name "CoS field" for this field.  In doing so it also updates documents that defines and uses this field.</t></abstract>
