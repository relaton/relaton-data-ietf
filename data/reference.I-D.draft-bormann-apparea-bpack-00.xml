<abstract><t>JSON (RFC 4627) is an extremely successful format for the representation of structured information, supporting Boolean values, numbers, strings, arrays, and tables.  Recently, a number of applications have started to look for binary representation formats that solve a similar problem.  In particular, constrained node networks can benefit from such a binary representation format.  A very successful binary representation that is otherwise comparable to JSON is MessagePack.  Recently, a slight modification of MessagePack has been defined that allows for distinguishing UTF-8 strings from binary data.  This draft, as an independent effort, documents the resulting BinaryPack format.  The current version -00 of this document is an early draft that is intended to spark further discussion.</t></abstract>
