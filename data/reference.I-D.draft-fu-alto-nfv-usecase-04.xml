<abstract><t>This documentation presents a use case of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) with the emergence of Network Function Virtualization (NFV).  The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service provides network information (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance.  The emerging NFV, which is currently being in progress in ETSI NFV, leverages standard IT virtualisation technology to consolidate many network equipment types onto industry standard high-volume servers, switches, and storage. The use case presented in this document discusses the impact of virtualization on the ALTO protocol.  An architecture is proposed for the interface between NFV MANO and ALTO server.  And possible end point property extention is also discussed for such usecase.</t></abstract>
