<abstract><t>Information Services are services whereby information is provided by the network in response to user requests, and may include involvement of a human or automated agent. A popular existing Information Service is Directory Assistance (DA). Moving ahead, Information Services providers envision exciting multimedia services that support simultaneous voice and data interactions with full operator backup at any time during the call. Information Services providers are planning to migrate to SIP based platforms, which will enable such advanced services, while continuing to support traditional DA services. This document aims to identify how such services can be implemented using existing or currently proposed SIP mechanisms.</t></abstract>
