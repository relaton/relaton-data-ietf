<abstract><t>This document defines a "manifest" for use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure.  A "manifest" is a signed object that contains a listing of all the signed objects in the repository publication point associated with an authority responsible for publishing in the repository.  For each certificate, or other forms of signed objects issued by the authority that are published at this repository publication point, the manifest contains both the name of the file containing the object, and a hash of the file content.  Manifests are intended to expose potential threats to relying parties of the results of a man-in-the middle withholding attack on repository retrieval operations.</t></abstract>
