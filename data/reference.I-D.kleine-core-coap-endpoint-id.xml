<abstract><t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) (see [RFC7252]), is an application layer protocol for constrained devices (e.g.low power, few memory) and networks (e.g. lossy, low bandwidth) which relies on UDP on the transport layer.  With CoAP it is often the case, that message exchanges need to extend the common request/response pattern, e.g.  for seperate responses.  This holds, e.g. for CON requests that are confirmed by the server with an empty ACK and answered later with a seperate response.  According to the CoAP specification the request/response matching is realized using a unique pair of the servers IP address and a token defined by the client.  Due to the mobile nature of some devices. e.g. smartphones, they are often assigned new IP addresses because of a network change.  Thus, the IP address of a CoAP server might change during an ongoing conversation.  This draft proposes a method to assign each communication partner with an identifier (endpoint ID) which replaces the IP address as (partial) key to relate requests and responses.  Besides the common seperate responses, the proposed method is also useful to handle IP address changes, e.g.  during an ongoing observation ([observe]) or a blockwise transfer ([block]).</t></abstract>
