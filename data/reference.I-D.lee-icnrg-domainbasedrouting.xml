<abstract><t>Moving the focus from nodes to information objects raises scalability issues because the number of addressable information objects is huge compared to the number of nodes, so scalable routing is an important challenge issue of ICN. There are two types of naming scheme which have been proposed in the ICN literatures: hierarchical and flat. To guarantee clean separation of identifier from locator and scalability of routing, we chose flat name and designed domain-based routing. A significant requisite to be considered when flat name is used is an efficient name-resolution system (NRS). Bloomfilter-based NRS [BF NRS] is our proposal to this issue. Once a name is resolved into locator(s), discovery and delivery steps are carried out based on the routing scheme of locator. For scalability in routing of locator, network is projected into hierarchically-organized domain structure. A domain is a group of nodes or other domains. This composition could be physical or logical. Each domain has its own identifier, and the concatenation of domain IDs from top level domain to a certain domain which a node belongs to plays the role of "locator" for that node. Each domain has one or more domain gateways. All traffic from/to the domain should pass through any of domain gateways. Routing information based on this type of locators is exchanged among domain gateways by using modified link-state routing protocol which can suppress LSA explosion [LSR]. Thanks to this hierarchical domain structure, locators are highly aggregatable (which means scalable routing), and any node in heterogeneous network can communicate each other.</t></abstract>
