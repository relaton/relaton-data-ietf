<abstract><t>To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) Service, Service Providers (SPs) need to instantiate multicast tunnels (known as "P-tunnels") that enable the Provider Edge (PE) routers of a given VPN to transmit multicast packets to each other.  Some SPs organize their networks in a hierarchical manner, with the PE routers in "edge areas", and the edge areas connected to each other via a "core area".  Although the edge areas and the core area may be in the same Autonomous System, the Border Routers of the core area use BGP to exchange routes to the PE routers.  A P-tunnel that connects PE routers in different edge areas can be thought of as having three segments: a segment through one edge area, a segment through the core area, and a segment through the second edge area.  It is desirable to preserve the independence of the core area by allowing it to use a different tunneling technology than that used in the edge areas.  However, it is not desirable for a Border Router to participate specifically in the MVPN signaling, or even to have any knowledge of which MVPNs are in the edge areas that attach to it.  This document specifies a simple method for segmenting MVPN P-tunnels at the BRs, subject to these constraints.</t></abstract>
