<abstract><t>This document defines the "xml2rfc" version 3 vocabulary: an XML- based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts.  It is heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under discussion.  This document obsoletes the earlier v3 grammar described in RFC 7991, which in turn obsoleted the v2 grammar in RFC 7749.  Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)  Discussion of this draft takes place on the xml2rfc-dev@ietf.org mailing list, which has its home page at &lt;https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/xml2rfc-dev>.</t></abstract>
