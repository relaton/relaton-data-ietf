<abstract><t>RADIUS is a protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization and accounting management for users to connect network services.  In current practical broadband networks, RADIUS protocol is widely used by ISPs when provisioning subscribers the access services (e.g.  PPPoE).  The RADIUS protocol has currently been specified to support both IPv4 and IPv6, while there are some issues emerging from the deployments of IPv6.  Notes: This initial version is just to get the work started, and will be updated soon.</t></abstract>
