<abstract><t>IEEE Std 802.16 is an air interface specification. IEEE has specified several service specific convergence sublayers (CS) for 802.16 which are used by upper layer protocols. The ATM CS and Packet CS are the two main service-specific convergence sublayers and these are a part of the 802.16 MAC which the upper layers interface to.The packet CS is used for transport for all packet-based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP), IEEE Std. 802.3 (Ethernet) and, IEEE Std 802.1Q (VLAN). The IP specific part of the Packet CS enables transport of IPv6 packets directly over the MAC. This document specifies the addressing and operation of IPv6 over the IPv6 specific part of the packet CS for hosts served by a network that utilizes the IEEE Std 802.16 air interface. It recommends the assignment of a unique prefix (or prefixes) to each host and allows the host to use multiple identifiers within that prefix, including support for randomly generated identifiers.</t></abstract>
