<abstract><t>This memo describes a proposed Simple File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).  It    fills the need of people wanting a protocol that is more useful than    TFTP but easier to implement (and less powerful) than FTP.  SFTP    supports user access control, file transfers, directory listing,    directory changing, file renaming and deleting.  Discussion of this    proposal is encouraged, and suggestions for improvements may be sent to    the author.</t></abstract>
