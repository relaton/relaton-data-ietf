<abstract><t>Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for, or deploying IPv6 into their networks.  The operators often face challenges related to both IPv6 introduction along with a growing risk of IPv4 run out within their organizations.  The overall problem for many operators will be to meet the simultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity and continue support for IPv4 connectivity for legacy devices and systems with a depleting supply of IPv4 addresses.  The overall transition will take most networks from an IPv4-Only environment to a dual stack network environment and potentially an IPv6-Only operating mode.  This document helps provide a framework for Wireline providers who may be faced with many of these challenges as they consider what IPv6 transition technologies to use, how to use the selected technologies and when to use them.</t></abstract>
