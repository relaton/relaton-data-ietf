<abstract><t>This document, part of the Lemonade Working Group, describes the Best Current Practice for streaming multimedia attachments received by a resource constrained and/or mobile device from a IMAP server. It allows such clients, which are limited in storage space and bandwidth, to play video and audio content which is attached to email messages. The document describes a profile for making use of the existing IMAP URLAUTH extension (RFC 4467) [2] and the "Netann" SIP Media Service as described in RFC 4240 [1].</t></abstract>
