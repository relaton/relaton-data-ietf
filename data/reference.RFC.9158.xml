<abstract><t>RFC 7299 describes the object identifiers that were assigned by the Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group in an arc that was allocated by IANA (1.3.6.1.5.5.7).  A small number of object identifiers that were assigned in RFC 4212 are omitted from RFC 7299, and this document updates RFC 7299 to correct that oversight.</t></abstract>
