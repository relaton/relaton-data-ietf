<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) architecture leverages the paradigm of source routing.  It can be realized in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network without any change to the data plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS label, and an ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels.  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is expected to monitor any existing path between systems.  This document defines how to use Label Switched Path Ping to bootstrap a BFD session, control path in reverse direction of the SR-MPLS tunnel and applicability of BFD Demand mode in the SR-MPLS domain.</t></abstract>
