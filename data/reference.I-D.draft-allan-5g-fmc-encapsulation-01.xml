<abstract><t>As part of providing wireline access to the 5G Core (5GC), deployed wireline networks carry user data between 5G residential gateways and the 5G Access Gateway Function (AGF). The encapsulation used needs to meet a variety of requirements including being able to multiplex the traffic of multiple PDU sessions within a VLAN delineated access circuit, to permit legacy equipment in the data path to snoop certain packet fields, to carry 5G QoS information associated with the data, and to be efficiently encoded. This memo specifies an encapsulation that meets these requirements.</t></abstract>
