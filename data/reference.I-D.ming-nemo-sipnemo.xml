<abstract><t>The Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support protocol enables a mobile network to change its point of attachment and keeps nodes in the mobile network reachable when the mobile network moves in the Internet. However, using the NEMO Basic Support protocol, all traffic must pass through the bi-directional tunnel between a mobile router and its home agent when the mobile router leaves its home network. The bi-directional tunnel results in sub-optimal routing and long transmission delay. This document describes the SIP-based Network Mobility (SIP-NEMO) Route Optimization (RO) that achieves optimal routing and reduces the limitation induced by Mobile IPv6.</t></abstract>
