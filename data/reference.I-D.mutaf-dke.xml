<abstract><t>This document describes a verbal key exchange protocol in which a short fingerprint is used to represent a "one-time" public key fingerprint.  The one-time public key is immediately used for key exchange, before an attacker has time to find a public/private key pair that gives the same fingerprint and mount a Man-in-the-Middle attack.  The protocol, however, requires that both users be present for fingerprint verification, making it suitable for mobile users only.</t></abstract>
