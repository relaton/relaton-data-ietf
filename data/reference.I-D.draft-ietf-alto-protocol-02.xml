<abstract><t>Networking applications today already have access to a great amount of Inter-Provider network topology information.  For example, views of the Internet routing table are easily available at looking glass servers and entirely practical to be downloaded by clients.  What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network topology from the ISP or Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point of view. In other words, what a Provider prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.  The ALTO Service provides information such as preferences of network resources with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance. This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO Service. While such service would primarily be provided by the network (i.e., the ISP), content providers and third parties could also operate this service.  Applications that could use this service are those that have a choice in connection endpoints.  Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</t></abstract>
