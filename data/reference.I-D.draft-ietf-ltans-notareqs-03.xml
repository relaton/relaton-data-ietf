<abstract><t>This document establishes the goals and requirements for protocols and data structures for use with services that provide additional means for users to ensure and prove the validity of data, especially digitally signed data, in a common and reproducible way. The data being validated may correspond to assertions about real-world facts or events. This document establishes the need for components to be used in addition to or in conjunction with long-term archive services. It provides some use cases and scenarios, and establishes technical requirements for protocols and data structures to support them.</t></abstract>
