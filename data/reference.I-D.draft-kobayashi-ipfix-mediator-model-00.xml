<abstract><t>An IPFIX Mediator is an intermediate node between IPFIX devices and traffic collectors. This node acts as an IPFIX proxy, IPFIX firewall, and IPFIX concentrator. An IPFIX Mediator mediates the IPFIX protocol using several functions. That enables the traffic monitoring system to become a high-capacity system and accommodate a variety of traffic monitoring methods. This document describes each function that is provided by IPFIX Mediators and the method of handling the Flow Records of each function. In addition, this describes the model of the solution scenario using IPFIX Mediator.</t></abstract>
