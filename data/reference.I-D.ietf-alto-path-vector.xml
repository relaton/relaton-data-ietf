<abstract><t>This document is an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.  It extends the ALTO Cost Map service and ALTO Property Map service so that the application can decide which endpoint(s) to connect based on not only numerical/ordinal cost values but also details of the paths.  This is useful for applications whose performance is impacted by specified components of a network on the end-to-end paths, e.g., they may infer that several paths share common links and prevent traffic bottlenecks by avoiding such paths.  This extension introduces a new abstraction called Abstract Network Element (ANE) to represent these components and encodes a network path as a vector of ANEs.  Thus, it provides a more complete but still abstract graph representation of the underlying network(s) for informed traffic optimization among endpoints.</t></abstract>
