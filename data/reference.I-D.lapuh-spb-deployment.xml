<abstract><t>Based on many live deployments, including the Sochi Winter Olympics 2014 network and multiple interoperability events, this document has been created to provide advice to network operators about best practices when implementing IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) networks. It is principally addressed to system integrators, network operators and solution providers, including those that do not yet support SPB. Some advice to protocol implementers is also provided. The intention of the advice is to facilitate multi vendor network deployments as well as provide guidance for new installations.</t></abstract>
