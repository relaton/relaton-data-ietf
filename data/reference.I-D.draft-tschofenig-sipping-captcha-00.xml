<abstract><t>Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is one of the foreseen future forms of spamming that SIP networks may have to handle. SPIT also has more impact on users than email spam since it is more intrusive. Email as a store-and-forward communication mechanism allows for several filtering mechanisms to be applied to the full content before being presented to the user. Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) interaction is, in contrast, real-time communication and therefore does not provide much information prior to the transmission of the content, making it both harder to filter and more annoying to users. The responsibility for filtering, blocking calls, or taking any other preventive action can belong to different elements in the call flow and may depend on various factors. This document concentrates on "Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart" (CAPTCHA) tests, which require human interaction. The document proposes an approach how to apply those challenges to SIP communication for handling the SPIT problem.</t></abstract>
