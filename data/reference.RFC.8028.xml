<abstract><t>This document describes expected IPv6 host behavior in a scenario that has more than one prefix, each allocated by an upstream network that is assumed to implement BCP 38 ingress filtering, when the host has multiple routers to choose from.  It also applies to other scenarios such as the usage of stateful firewalls that effectively act as address-based filters.  Host behavior in choosing a first-hop router may interact with source address selection in a given implementation.  However, the selection of the source address for a packet is done before the first-hop router for that packet is chosen. Given that the network or host is, or appears to be, multihomed with multiple provider-allocated addresses, that the host has elected to use a source address in a given prefix, and that some but not all neighboring routers are advertising that prefix in their Router Advertisement Prefix Information Options, this document specifies to which router a host should present its transmission.  It updates RFC 4861.</t></abstract>
