<abstract><t>This memo documents a currently existing and previously privately defined DHCPv4 option, documenting the operation and usage of the Cisco Systems Subnet Allocation Option for DHCPv4.  The option is passed between the DHCPv4 Client and the DHCPv4 Server to request dynamic allocation of a subnet, give specifications of subnet(s) allocated, and report usage statistics.  This memo documents the current usage of the option in agreement with [RFC3942], which declares that any pre-existing usages of option numbers in the range 128 - 223 should be documented and the working group will try to officially assign those numbers to those options.</t></abstract>
