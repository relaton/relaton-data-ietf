<abstract><t>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs. The model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975 and RFC4976 in the following ways: it uses SDP in a more conventional way when it comes to conveying endpoint address information, and it uses COMEDIA for connection establishment.  Because of this, the model also allows for the usage of mainstream mechanisms for NAT traversal, instead of using MSRP relays.</t></abstract>
