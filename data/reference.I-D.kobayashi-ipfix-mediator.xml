<abstract><t>An IPFIX Mediator is an intermediate node between IPFIX Devices and traffic Collectors. This node acts as a IPFIX proxy or IPFIX concentrator. Therefore, IPFIX Mediators enables cascade connection. This document defines the Option Template required by cascade connection and a reference internal component model and describes several solution scenarios that use IPFIX Mediators. An IPFIX Mediator is an intermediate node between IPFIX Devices and traffic Collectors. This node acts as a IPFIX proxy or IPFIX concentrator. IPFIX Mediator has several capabilities such as storage function of original Flow Records, flexible aggregation function, and proper distribution function for collector or analyzer. The combination of these capabilities can solve several problems related to traffic monitoring.</t></abstract>
