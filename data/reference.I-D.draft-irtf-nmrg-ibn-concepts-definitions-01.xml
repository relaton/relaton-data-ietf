<abstract><t>Intent and Intent-Based Networking (IBN) are taking the industry by storm.  At the same time, those terms are used loosely and often inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and confused with other concepts such as "Policy".  This document clarifies the concept of "Intent" and provides an overview of functionality that is associated with it.  The goal is to contribute towards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that can be used as foundation to guide further definition of associated research and engineering problems and their solutions.</t></abstract>
