<abstract><t>Multipath TCP (MPTCP for short) describes the extensions proposed for TCP so that endpoints of a given TCP connection can use multiple paths to exchange data.  Such extensions enable the exchange of segments using different source-destination address pairs, resulting in the capability of using multiple paths in a significant number of scenarios.  Some level of multihoming and mobility support can be achieved through these extensions.  However, the support for multiple IP addresses per endpoint may have implications on the security of the resulting MPTCP.  This note includes a threat analysis for MPTCP. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
