<abstract><t>Next-generation enterprise networks including the global Internet itself will require an architected solution for the coordination of internal routing and addressing plans with considerations for scalability, mobility, multi-homing and security.  Additionally, next-generation networks will require support for both Internet protocol versions (IPv4 and IPv6) for an indeterminant period; perhaps even indefinitely.  These considerations are particularly true for existing deployments, but the same principles apply even for clean-slate approaches.  The RANGER architecture addresses these requirements, and provides a comprehensive framework for IPv6/IPv4 coexistence.</t></abstract>
