<abstract><t>RFC 3484 has several known issues to be fixed mainly because of the deprecation of IPv6 site-local unicast address and the coming of ULA. Additionally, the rule 9 of the destination address selection rules, namely the longest matching rule, is known for its adverse effect on the round robin DNS technique.  This document covers these essential points to be modified and proposes possible useful changes to be included in the revision of RFC 3484.</t></abstract>
