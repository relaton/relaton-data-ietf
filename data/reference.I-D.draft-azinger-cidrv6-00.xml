<abstract><t>This document discusses strategies for assigning and aggregating IPv6 address space.  While CIDR was created to help alleviate this problem in regards to IPv4 addresses with the original [RFC1519] (and updated in [RFC4632]) we are now in need of a similar document to give direction for IPv6 addressing policies.  Similarly, [RFC1518] discussed how to use CIDR to allocate address space for IPv4, and [RFC1887] discusses the subject for IPv6.  The objective here is to update these documents and provide the best current guidance on how to manage address space in conjunction with managing the growth of routing tables in an IPv6 world.</t></abstract>
