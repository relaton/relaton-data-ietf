<abstract><t>This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) extension for notifying clients of operations on client sponsored objects that were not initiated by the client through EPP.  These operations MAY include contractual or policy requirements including but not limited to regular batch processes, customer support actions, Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) or Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS) actions, court directed actions, and bulk updates based on customer requests.  Since the client is not directly involved or knowledgable of these operations, the extension is used along with an EPP object mapping to provide the resulting state of the post-operation object, and optionally a pre-operation object, with the operation meta-data of what, when, who, and why.</t></abstract>
