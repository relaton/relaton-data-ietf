<abstract><t>This document presents the concept and practice of the prefix- specific and stateless address mapping mechanism (IVI) for IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition.  In this scheme, subsets of the IPv4 addresses are embedded in prefix-specific IPv6 addresses and these IPv6 addresses can therefore communicate with the global IPv6 networks directly and can communicate with the global IPv4 networks via stateless gateways.  The IVI scheme supports the end-to-end address transparency and incremental deployment.  This document is a comprehensive report on the IVI design and its deployment in large scale public networks.  Version 01 of the IVI document is a simplified version of version 00 to present the main concepts and recent practice of the IVI translation scheme.</t></abstract>
