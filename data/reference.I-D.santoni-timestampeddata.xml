<abstract><t>This document describes an envelope which can be used to bind a file (not necessarily protected by means of cryptographic techniques) with one or more time-stamp tokens obtained for that file, where "time- stamp token" has the meaning defined in RFC 3161 or its successors. Additional types of temporal evidence are also allowed.  The proposed envelope is based on the Cryptographic Message Syntax as defined in RFC 3852.</t></abstract>
