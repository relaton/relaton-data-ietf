<abstract><t>This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) as defined in [RFC3986], for designating connections and destination addresses used in the Java(tm) Messaging Service (JMS) [REF-JMS].  It was originally designed for particular uses, but should have general applicability wherever a JMS URI is needed to describe the connection to a JMS provider, and access to a JMS destination.  The syntax of this 'jms' URI is not compatible with any known current vendor implementation, but the expressivity of the format should permit all vendors to use it.</t></abstract>
