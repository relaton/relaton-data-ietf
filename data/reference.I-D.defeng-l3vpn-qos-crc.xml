<abstract><t>This document focuses on the QoS problem in NBVPN, analyses the QoS requirement for NBVPN, the insufficiency of QoS guarantee in the current NBVPN schemes in the related IETF work group, and proposes a QoS-guaranteed NBVPN reference model with centralized resource controller, in this model, some new concepts are introduced, such as VPN Logical Bearer Network(VPN-LBN), VPN Centralized resource controller(VPN-CRC); and mechanism of guaranteeing the VPN QoS is explained in details, including address space, isolation between VPNs, VPN route distribution, forwarding, interface requirement signaling requirement, hybrid QoS-VPN, intra-domain VPN, inter-domain VPN.</t></abstract>
