<abstract><t>This document makes the argument that to support the centralized control of a substantial number of forwarding devices (as Software Defined Networking (SDN) proposes) that the scale, speed, cost and general quality of such a solution will be improved by reducing the state needed to be distributed into the network of devices by the controller(s). To this end we re-visit forms of Source Routing (SR), in particular Strict Link Source Routing (SLSR) and suggest that light weight SLSR could allow substantial reduction in controller burden while potentially reducing the costs/complexity on forwarding devices. We discuss some simulation results that demonstrate these advantages and how the advantages grow substantially as the network diameter grows. We also look at various implementation possibilities including existing IPV4, V6, MPLS, new/modified MPLS vs. something brand new that could possibly be implemented with new SDN technology like Protocol Oblivious Forwarding-POF.</t></abstract>
