<abstract><t>The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) policies, have different views regarding the recommendation of the prefix to be assigned to end-sites.  However, all them allow up to a /48 without further justification and clearly state that the exact choice of how much address space should be assigned to end-sites is a decision of each operator.  This document reviews the architectural and operational considerations of end-site assignments, and reiterates that assignment policy and guidelines belong to the RIR community.  This revision is being made to emphasize that IPv6 protocol evolution requires an ever-increasing availability of subnets at the end-site and so, policy should reflect that assignment of a single subnet is never appropriate.  This document obsoletes RFC6177 (IPv6 Address Assignment to End Sites).</t></abstract>
