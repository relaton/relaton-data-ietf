<abstract><t>In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile Node (MN) is assigned with a 64-bit Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its initial attachment for the Home Address (HoA) configuration.  During the movement of the MN, this prefix remains unchanged and in this way it is unnecessary for the MN to reconfigure its HoA and reconnect the ongoing communications.  However, the current protocol (RFC5213) does not specify related operations to support the MN to timely receive and use a new HNP when the allocated HNP changes.  In this draft, a solution to support the HNP renumbering is proposed, as an update of RFC5213.</t></abstract>
