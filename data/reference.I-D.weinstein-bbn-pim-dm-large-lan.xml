<abstract><t>Optimizations to the PIM-DM protocol [RFC3973] are proposed that dramatically reduce the PIM-DM routing overhead on local area networks containing large numbers of PIM routers.  These optimizations reduce the likelihood of two or more routers emitting redundant JOIN or PRUNE messages onto the same LAN.  While these optimizations are of general applicability to large LANs, they were motivated in particular by performance requirements for supporting PIM-DM across LANs emulated by IP tunneling over large wireless MANETs.  PIM-DM routers supporting these optimizations will interoperate with standard PIM-DM as defined in RFC 3973, even on the same LAN. However, to obtain maximum benefit from these optimizations, all PIM-DM routers on the LAN SHOULD support them.</t></abstract>
