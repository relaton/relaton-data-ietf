<abstract><t>This document extends the AAA authorization framework described in RFC 2904 in that some or all of the authorization task is delegated from the AAA server to a local network entity. The extension considers new AAA services such as PANA network access service and dynamic host configuration service that have different characteristics from legacy AAA services such as PPP service and IEEE 802.1X network access service.</t></abstract>
