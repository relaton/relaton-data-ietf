<abstract><t>OAuth enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to a protected resource, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.</t><t>This document defines how an application client uses credentials obtained via OAuth over the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) to access a protected resource at a resource server.  Thereby, it enables schemes defined within the OAuth framework for non-HTTP-based application protocols.</t><t>Clients typically store the user's long-term credential.  This does, however, lead to significant security vulnerabilities, for example, when such a credential leaks.  A significant benefit of OAuth for usage in those clients is that the password is replaced by a shared secret with higher entropy, i.e., the token.  Tokens typically provide limited access rights and can be managed and revoked separately from the user's long-term password.</t></abstract>
