<abstract><t>This memo describes a technique for dynamically discovering the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of an arbitrary internet path.  It specifies a small change to the way routers generate one type of ICMP message.  For a path that passes through a router that has not been so changed, this technique might not discover the correct Path MTU, but it will always choose a Path MTU as accurate as, and in many cases more accurate than, the Path MTU that would be chosen by current practice.
