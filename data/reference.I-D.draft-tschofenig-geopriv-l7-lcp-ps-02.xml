<abstract><t>This document provides a problem statement and lists requirements for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol. This protocol aims to allow an end host to obtain location information, by value or by reference, from a Location Information Server (LIS) that is located in the access network. The obtained location information can then be used for a variety of different protocols and purposes. For example, it can be used as input to the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) or to convey location within SIP to other entities. Disclaimer: This document represents the current status of the discussions at the Geopriv-L7 design team and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of every design team participant.</t></abstract>
