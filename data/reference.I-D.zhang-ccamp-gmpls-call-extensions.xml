<abstract><t>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions are used to support Calls. Although it is stated that these mechanisms are applicable to any environment (including multi-area), the "Call Path" is determined hop-by-hop by each "Call Manager" in sequence along the path of the Call.  However, it is desirable to allow the Call-initiator to identify the Call Path explicitly in some cases (especially in the multi-domain case).  This document describes RSVP-TE signaling extensions to allow the Call-initiator to identify the Call Path explicitly when transit nodes (besides the Call-initiator and Call-terminator) are involved in these Calls.</t></abstract>
