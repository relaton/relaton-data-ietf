<abstract><t>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific BIER header.  PIM is a well-known multicast-specific routing protocol which is widely deployed either in a VRF context or in a Non-VRF context.  This document describes PIM extensions to signal a P2MP Tree with BIER information, which is called a P2MP based BIER in [I.D.xie-bier-mvpn-mpls-p2mp].  PIM is required to alloc Label to build a P2MP tree hop-by-hop, and build a P2MP based BIER forwarding table further.  This requires a BitMask being carried as a PIM Join Attribute by downstream node to upstream node hop-by-hop, and the behavior is like precedures as specified in [RFC6807].</t></abstract>
