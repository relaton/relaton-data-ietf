<abstract><t>This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initial assessment of proposed TCP modifications.  The goal of the test suite is to allow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate their proposed TCP extensions in simulators and testbeds using a common set of well- defined, standard test cases, in order to compare and contrast proposals against standard TCP as well as other proposed modifications.  This test suite is not intended to result in an exhaustive evaluation of a proposed TCP modification or new congestion control mechanism.  Instead, the focus is on quickly and easily generating an initial evaluation report that allows the networking community to understand and discuss the behavioral aspects of a new proposal, in order to guide further experimentation that will be needed to fully investigate the specific aspects of such proposal.</t></abstract>
