<abstract><t>In RFC2779 [RFC2779] and RFC2778 [RFC2778], XMPP [RFC3920] client is defined as "PRINCIPALS are the people, groups, and/or software in the "real world" outside the system that use the system as a means of coordination and communication.  Considering this description, it does not matter whether the user of end node is human or software. However, current specification of XMPP is expected that there will be a human in front of the client. So, there is no consideration for looping the message between softwares and processing message that human will not be able to react. Recently system and software are replying in return of human. Moreover, by making client act like a human, new network service can be made.  There are many of these called "bots" already, but there is a possibility which can aggregate or control remote resources.By clarifying models of usage and problem, this document aims to use XMPP in software-to-software and human-to-software models not only human-to-human model.</t></abstract>
