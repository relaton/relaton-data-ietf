<abstract><t>This document specifies a new TCP option - the TCP User Timeout Option - that allows a TCP to advertise its current user timeout for a connection. Thus, the remote TCP may modify its local user timeout based on knowledge of the peer's user timeout. The TCP user timeout controls how long transmitted data may remain unacknowledged before a connection is forcefully closed. It is a local, per-connection parameter. Increasing the user timeouts allows established TCP connections to survive extended periods of disconnection. Decreasing the user timeouts allows busy servers to explicitly notify their clients that they will maintain the connection state only across short periods of disconnection.</t></abstract>
