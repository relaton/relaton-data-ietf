<abstract><t>Fixed-mobile convergence encompasses a variety of use cases that include situations in which a wireless device travels between a point of attachment in a mobile network (such as a cellular base station) and another point of attachment anchored in a fixed network such as a WiFi hotspot.  Convergence then means enabling an end-user to access services or retrieve content whatever the network access conditions (e.g., fixed or mobile access infrastructure), and whether the end- user is in motion or not.  This document discusses the issues related to convergence and elaborates a set of requirements.</t></abstract>
