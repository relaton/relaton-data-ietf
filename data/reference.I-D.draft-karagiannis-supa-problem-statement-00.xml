<abstract><t>As modern network management applications grow in scale and complexity, their demands and requirements on the supporting communication network increase. In particular, network operators are challenged to create a simplified view of their network infrastructure and help service developers on using and programming this simplified view rather than manipulating individual devices. In this context, providing service developers with a set of standard interfaces to configure and set policies on the network is essential. This document describes what has to be addressed in order to equip service providers with standardized application-based interfaces used to expose and define policies and a simplified view of network infrastructure.</t></abstract>
