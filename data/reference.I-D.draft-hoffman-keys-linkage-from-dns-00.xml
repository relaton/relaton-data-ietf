<abstract><t>TLS uses PKIX certificates for authenticating the server.  Users want their applications to verify that the key in the certificate provided by the TLS server is in fact associated with the domain name they expect.  Instead of trusting a certificate authority to have made this association correctly, the user might instead trust the authoritative DNS server for the domain name to make that association.  This document describes how to use secure DNS to associate the key that appears in a TLS server's certificate with the the intended domain name.</t></abstract>
