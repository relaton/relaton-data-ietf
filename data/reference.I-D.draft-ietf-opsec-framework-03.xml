<abstract><t>This document outlines work to be done and documents to be produced by the Operational Security Capabilities (OPSEC) Working Group. The goal of the working group is to codify knowledge gained through operational experience about feature sets that are needed to securely deploy and operate managed network elements providing transit services at the data link and IP layers. The intent is to provide clear, concise documentation of capabilities necessary for operating networks securely, to assist network operators in communicating their requirements to vendors, and to provide vendors with input that is useful for building more secure devices. The working group will produce a list of capabilities appropriate for large Internet Service Provider (ISP) and Enterprise Networks. This work is intended to refine [RFC3871].</t></abstract>
