<abstract><t>If a host is located behind a NAT, then in certain situations it can be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers) located behind other NATs.  In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication relay.  This specification defines a protocol, called TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT), that allows the host to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay. The TURN protocol can be used in isolation, but is more properly used as part of the ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) approach to NAT traversal.</t></abstract>
