<abstract><t>This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=").  This is referred to as bundled media.  Both endpoints can negotiate the use of bundle and to support that negotiations, this specification defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can be used to request that specific media is only used if bundled.  This specification also updates sections 5.1, 8.1 and 8.2 of RFC 3264 to allows an answerer to assign a non-zero port value to an "m=" line in an SDP answer, even if the "m=" line in the associated SDP offer contained a zero port value.  There are multiple ways to correlate the bundled RTP packets with the appropriate media descriptions.  This specification defines a new RTP SDES item and a new RTP header extension that provides an additional way to do this correlation by using them to carry a value that associates the RTP/RTCP packets with a specific media description.</t></abstract>
