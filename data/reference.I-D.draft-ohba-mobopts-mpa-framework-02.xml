<abstract><t>This document describes a framework of Media-independent Pre- Authentication (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that has a potential to address issues on existing mobility management protocols and mobility optimization mechanisms. MPA is a mobile- assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that works over any link-layer and with any mobility management protocol. [I-D.ohba- mobopts-mpa-implementation] is an accompanying document which shows two sets of implementation of MPA including performance results to show how existing protocols could be leveraged to realize the functionalities of MPA.</t></abstract>
