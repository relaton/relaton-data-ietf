<abstract><t>This RFC discusses protocols proposed recently in RFCs 914 and 916, and    suggests a proposed protocol that could meet the same needs addressed in    those memos.  The stated need is reliable communication between two    programs over a full-duplex, point-to-point communication link, and in    particular the RFCs address the need for such communication over an    asynchronous link at relatively low speeds. The suggested protocol uses    the methods of existing national and international data link layer    standards.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet    community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract>
