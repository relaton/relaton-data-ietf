<abstract><t>Implementing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) advanced features and services requires to use numerous specifications.  Today, for each service in the scope of BLISS, one can already find references to many possible specifications which do not cover the same things. Some of them are primitive operations (GRUU, REFER, target dialog, ...), some are requirements or call flow examples, some others have a larger scope: TISPAN specs, SPIT to implement Call Barring...  The goal of this document is not to present the best solutions; but to give an overview of every standard specification related to these services, centralizing and categorizing them as input to the working group.</t></abstract>
