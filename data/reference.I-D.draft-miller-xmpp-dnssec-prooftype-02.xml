<abstract><t>This document defines a prooftype that uses DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) for associating a domain name with an XML stream in the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).  It also defines a method that uses DNS Security (DNSSEC) for securely delegating a source domain to a derived domain in XMPP.</t></abstract>
