<abstract><t>Operators are currently challenged with enabling IPv6 within their networks while maintaing IPv4 connectivity beyond IPv4 address depletion.  In the Wireline world, this will often require the replacement of access network equipment and consumer equipment along with the uplift of the core network.  During the transition from the IPv4-Only service environment to the IPv6/IPv4 dual service environment, operators may often need to use multiple transition technologies and mechanisms to maintain services for their customer base.  This draft is set up to show how some Wireline provides (including Cable, DSL and Fibre) may accomplish this using tunnelling, translation and native IPv6 services.</t></abstract>
