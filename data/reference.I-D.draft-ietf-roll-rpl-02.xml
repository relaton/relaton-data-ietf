<abstract><t>Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are made largely of constrained nodes (with limited processing power, memory, and sometimes energy when they are battery operated).  These routers are interconnected by lossy links, most of the time supporting only low data rates, that are usually fairly unstable with relatively low packet delivery rates.  Another characteristic of such networks is that the traffic patterns are not simply unicast, but in many cases point-to- multipoint or multipoint-to-point.  Furthermore such networks may potentially comprise a large number of nodes, up to several dozens or hundreds or more nodes in the network.  These characteristics offer unique challenges to a routing solution: the IETF ROLL Working Group has defined application-specific routing requirements for a Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) routing protocol.  This document specifies the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL).</t></abstract>
