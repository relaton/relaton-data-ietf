<abstract><t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP has been in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This document updates RFC 7233, Part 5 of the eight-part specification that defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1". Part 5 defines range-specific requests and the rules for constructing and combining responses to those requests. This document improves support for responding to range requests for resources of indeterminate size.</t></abstract>
