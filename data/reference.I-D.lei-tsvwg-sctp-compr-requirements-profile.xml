<abstract><t>This document is to specify the requirements to compress headers of IP/SCTP package and how ROHC mechanism compresses SCTP.  Streaming Control Transport Protocol is new generation IP transport protocol which has been published in RFC2960 and updated by RFC4960.  SCTP can maintain association among multiple peers, thus supports multiple homing and multiple streaming, while inherits most functions of TCP. SCTP as transport protocol has been used to carry signaling or possible user plane data in turbulence network which needs to save spectrum resource by compressing IP headers.</t></abstract>
