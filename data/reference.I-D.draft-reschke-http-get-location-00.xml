<abstract><t>Several hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) extensions use methods other than GET to expose information. This has the drawback that this kind of information is harder to identify (missing a URL to which a GET request could be applied) and to cache. This document specifies a simple extension header through which a server can advertise a substitute URL that an HTTP client subsequently can use with the GET method.</t></abstract>
