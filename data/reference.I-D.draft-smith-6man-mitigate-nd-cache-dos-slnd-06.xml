<abstract><t>One of the functions of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is to discover whether a specified neighbor is present.  During the neighbor presence discovery process state is created.  A node's capacity for this state can be intentionally exhausted to perform a denial of service attack, known as the "Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack".  This memo proposes a stateless form of neighbor presence discovery to prevent this Neighbor Discovery DoS Attack.</t></abstract>
