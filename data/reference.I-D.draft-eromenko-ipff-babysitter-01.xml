<abstract><t>Babysitter is a form of an advanced NAT, mostly for desktop clients. It gives mixed IP-FF and IPv4 clients access to IPv4-only Internet. It is somewhat resembling NAT64 + DNS64 combo, and will aid during transition period.  Assumption: We work on IPv4-only Internet, but we want to implement both IP-FF and IPv4 hosts inside our organization, so nodes can work between themselves with, and take advantage of, IP-FF, but still able to connect to the Internet. If/when this assumption is invalid, and end-to-end IP-FF becomes commonplace, other forms of connection should be used, and babysitter may be disabled.</t></abstract>
