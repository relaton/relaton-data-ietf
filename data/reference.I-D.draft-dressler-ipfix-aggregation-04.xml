<abstract><t>IPFIX Flow Aggregation describes a methodology for reducing the amount of measurement data exchanged between monitoring devices (IPFIX Exporters) and analyzers (IPFIX Collectors).  Aggregation techniques represent a necessary enhancement in order to cope with increasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with the ever- growing network capacities.  Using aggregation techniques, measurement information of multiple Flows that are sharing some common criteria is merged to be exported in one Compound Flow. Subsets of Flows eligible for aggregation, as well as the desired degree of similarity, can be customized using a set of Aggregation Rules.</t></abstract>
