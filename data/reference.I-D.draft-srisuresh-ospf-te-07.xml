<abstract><t>This document defines OSPF-xTE, an experimental traffic engineering (TE) extension to the link-state routing protocol OSPF. OSPF-xTE defines new TE LSAs to disseminate TE metrics within an autonomous System (AS), which may consist of multiple areas. Further, When an AS consists of TE and non-TE nodes, OSPF-xTE ensures that Non-TE nodes in the AS are uneffected by the TE LSAs. OSPF-xTE generates a stand-alone TE Link State Database (TE-LSDB), distinct from the native OSPF LSDB, for computation of TE circuit paths. OSPF-xTE is versatile and extendible to non-packet networks such as SONET/TDM and optical networks.</t></abstract>
