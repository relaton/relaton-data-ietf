<abstract><t>The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access network can be improved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) functionality in VPLS access. PBB is in the process of being standardized as IEEE 802.1ah, which is an amendment to 802.1Q to improve the scalability of MAC addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet networks. This document describes how IEEE 802.1ah functionality can be used in the H-VPLS access network to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses and number of service instances that can be supported. This document also describes the scenarios and the mechanisms for incorporating PBB functionality within H-VPLS with existing IEEE 802.1ad (aka QinQ) Ethernet access and interoperability among them.</t></abstract>
