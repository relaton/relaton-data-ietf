<abstract><t>This memo is distributed as an RFC only to make this information    easily accessible to researchers in the ARPA community.  It does not    specify an Internet standard.  This RFC defines the standard format    for interchange of Network News articles among USENET sites.  It    describes the format for articles themselves, and gives partial    standards for transmission of news.  The news transmission is not    entirely standardized in order to give a good deal of flexibility to    the individual hosts to choose transmission hardware and software,    whether to batch news and so on.</t></abstract>
