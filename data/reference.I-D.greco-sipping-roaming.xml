<abstract><t>Roaming services allow users that have a contract with a voice service provider to use access resources owned by other providers known as internet access providers. This draft proposes a token- based Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) and billing model for roaming users supporting the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). It also introduces a protocol solution for the proposed model that is based on the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</t></abstract>
