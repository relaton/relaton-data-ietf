<abstract><t>Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends on some addressing and routing.  This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be self-managing, and as independent as possible of configuration.  This document defines such a plane and calls it the &quot;Autonomic Control Plane&quot;, with the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions.  It also serves as a &quot;virtual out-of-band channel&quot; for Operations, Administration and Management (OAM) communications over a network that provides automatically configured hop-by-hop authenticated and encrypted communications via automatically configured IPv6 even when the network is not configured, or misconfigured.</t></abstract>
