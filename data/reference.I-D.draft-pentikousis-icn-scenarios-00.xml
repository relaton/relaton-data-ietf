<abstract><t>This document presents scenarios for information-centric networking (ICN) which can be used to establish a common understanding about potential experimental setups where different approaches can be tested and compared against each other.  The scenarios are primarily based on published literature, that is, they have all been considered in one or more performance evaluation studies, which are already available to the community.  The scenarios selected for inclusion in this first draft aim to exercise a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can address.  They include a) general aspects, such as, network efficiency, mobility support, multicast and caching performance, real-time communication efficacy, disruption and delay tolerance; and b) ICN-specific aspects, such as, information security and trust, persistence, availability, provenance, and location independence.</t></abstract>
