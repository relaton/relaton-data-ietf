<abstract><t>The SIP protocol imposes a limit on the number of hops a request may make from a sender to the recipient. When this limit is reached, a 483 error response is returned. The present form of the 483 response does not provide enough information for the sender or proxies on the path to diagnose failures whose symptom is that the hop limit is reached. This document proposes additional diagnostic information to be returned in a 483 response. Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the SIP working group list at 'sip@ietf.org'.</t></abstract>
