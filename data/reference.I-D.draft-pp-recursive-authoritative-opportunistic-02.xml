<abstract><t>This document describes a use case and a method for a DNS recursive resolver to use opportunistic encryption when communicating with authoritative servers.  A motivating use case for this method is that more encryption on the Internet is better, and opportunistic encryption is better than no encryption at all.  The method here is optional for both the recursive resolver and the authoritative server.  Nothing in this method prevents use cases and methods that require authenticated encryption.</t></abstract>
