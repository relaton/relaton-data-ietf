<abstract><t>The proposed pretty Easy privacy (pEp) protocols for email are based upon already existing email and encryption formats (as PGP/MIME) and designed to allow for easily implementable and interoperable opportunistic encryption.  The protocols range from key distribution, secret key synchronization between own devices, to mechanisms of metadata and content protection.  The metadata and content protection is achieved by moving the whole message (not only the body part) into the PGP/MIME encrypted part.  The proposed pEp Email Formats not only achieve simple forms of metadata protection (like subject encryption), but also allow for sending email messages through a mixnet.  Such enhanced forms of metadata protection are explicitly discussed within the scope of this document.  The purpose of pEp for email is to simplify and automate operations in order to make usage of email encryption a viability for a wider range of Internet users, with the goal of achieving widespread implementation of data confidentiality and privacy practices in the real world.  The proposed operations and formats are targeted towards to Opportunistic Security scenarios and are already implemented in several applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).</t></abstract>
