<abstract><t>The MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) has been widely accepted not only for providing digital TV services, but also as a subnetwork technology for building IP networks.</t><t>This document describes a Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) mechanism for the transport of IPv4 and IPv6 Datagrams and other network protocol packets directly over the ISO MPEG-2 Transport Stream as TS Private Data.  ULE specifies a base encapsulation format and supports an extension format that allows it to carry additional header information to assist in network/Receiver processing.
