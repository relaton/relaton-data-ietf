<abstract><t>ISA100.11a is a Working Group at the ISA SP100 standard committee that covers Wireless Systems for Industrial Automation and Process Control.  The WG is mandated to design a scalable, industrial grade LowPAN for devices such as sensors, valves, and actuators.  The upcoming standard uses the 6LoWPAN format for the network header.  It also introduces the concept of a Backbone Router to merge small LoWPANs via a high speed transit and scale the ISA100.11a network. This paper proposes an IPv6 version of the Backbone Router concept.</t></abstract>
