<abstract><t>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UA) receive identifiers for the caller and callee during call establishment. These identifiers can come in a variety of forms, can be delivered by a variety of means, and may or may not be accompanied by evidence of authenticity.  Furthermore, if media are secured (e.g., using the Secure Real-Time Protocol, SRTP), the security properties of the media will depend on binding the media to a received authenticated identifier.  This document examines the various identification information a UA can receive during call establishment and how a user agent can use this information to present a caller or callee identifier to the user and indicate to the user the security properties of the call, as well as how the user agent might use this information for other purposes, such as authorizing acceptance of a call.  This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
