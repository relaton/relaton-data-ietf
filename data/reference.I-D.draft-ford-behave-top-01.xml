<abstract><t>This document identifies two problems that have arisen from the the unconventional network topologies that are often constructed with the deployment of network address translator devices (NATs). This document also specifies best current practice recommendations for dealing with the issues identified with the two problems. First, the simplicity of administering networks through the combination of NAT and DHCP has increasingly lead to the deployment of multi-level hierarchies of inter-connected private networks involving overlapping private IP address spaces. Second, the proliferation of private networks in the corporates and the wide spread use of remote access virtual private networks (VPNs) can lead to conflict of private IP address space between the remote network where the VPN client is located and the corporate network.</t></abstract>
