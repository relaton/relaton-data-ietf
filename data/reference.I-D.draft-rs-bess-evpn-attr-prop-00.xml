<abstract><t>EVPN is being actively used to provide tenant inter-subnet-forwarding in DC networks, as described in [IP-PREFIX] and [INTER-SUBNET]. When those tenant networks are interconnected to vpn-ipv4/vpn-ipv6 or ipv4/ipv6 BGP networks, there is a need for the EVPN BGP Path Attributes to be seamlessly propagated so that the receiver PE or NVE can consider the original EVPN Attributes in its path calculations. This document analyses the use-cases, requirements and rules based on which the BGP Path Attributes should be propagated between EVPN and other BGP families.</t></abstract>
