<abstract><t>Weak Identifier Multihoming Protocol Framework (WIMP-F) is a wedge layer 3.5 framework to be applied with different kind of routable application layer identifiers (AIDs) and layer 3.5 context identifiers (CIDs) presented in Group-F. WIMP-F consists of context establishment and re-addressing exchanges that are protected with one-way hash chains and a technique called as secret splitting. The hash chain protects a host from re-direction attacks, but not directly from an CID or AID theft. The ownerships can be provided in variable ways presented in other Multi6 drafts.</t></abstract>
