<abstract><t>This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).  The Publish Option is used by a CoAP Endpoint to control the authority delegation of one of its resources to another Endpoint.  All the phases of the authority delegation process (setup, renewal, cancellation) are controlled by a simple RESTful protocol.  This memo also introduces the 'proxies' Web Linking relation type, to be used by a CoAP Proxy to explicitly advertise the resources that it can serve - either from its cache, or by forwarding the Client's request upstream.  The Publish Option and the 'proxies' relation provide the building blocks for a comprehensive, in-protocol, solution to the sleepy/ intermittent Endpoint use case.</t></abstract>
