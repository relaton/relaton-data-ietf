<abstract><t>This document presents a scalable architecture for assigning and aggregating IPv6 address space.  The current IPv4 addressing aggregation strategy was defined in [RFC1519] (and updated in [RFC4632]) and the IPv4 address allocation architecture was defined in [RFC1518].  A similar address allocation architecture was proposed for IPv6 in [RFC1887].  The objective of this document is to update the previous documents and provide the best current guidance on an address allocation architecture to help manage the growth of routing tables in IPv6.</t></abstract>
