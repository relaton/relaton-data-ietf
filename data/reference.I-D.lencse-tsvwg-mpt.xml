<abstract><t>Although several contemporary IT devices have multiple network interfaces, communication sessions are restricted to use only one of them at a time due to the design of the TCP/IP protocol stack: the communication endpoint is identified by an IP address and a TCP or UDP port number. The simultaneous use of these multiple interfaces for a communication session would improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failures.  MPT is a network layer multipath solution, which provides a tunnel over multiple paths using the GRE-in-UDP specification, thus being different from both MPTCP and Huawei's GRE Tunnel Bonding Protocol.  MPT can also be used as a router, routing the packets among several networks between the tunnel endpoints, thus establishing a multipath site-to-site connection.  The version of tunnel IP and the version of path IP are independent from each other, therefore MPT can also be used for IPv6 transition purposes.</t></abstract>
