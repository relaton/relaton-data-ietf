<abstract><t>Traditional discrete logarithm-based Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange during the TLS handshake suffers from a number of security, interoperability, and efficiency shortcomings.  These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about which DH group parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept.  This document offers a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by establishing a registry of DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism for peers to indicate support for these groups.</t></abstract>
