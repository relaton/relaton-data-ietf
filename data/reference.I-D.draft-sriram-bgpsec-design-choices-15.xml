<abstract><t>This document is written to capture the design rationale primarily for the individual draft-00 version of BGPsec protocol specification [I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol].  However, where appropriate, the document also provides brief notes on design decisions that changed (relative to individual draft-00 version) in the finalized protocol specification [RFC8205].  The notes mention what the differences are and provide pointers to where the details and/or rationale can be found about those changes in design.  The document lists the decisions that were made in favor of or against each design choice, and presents brief summaries of the arguments that aided the decision process.</t></abstract>
