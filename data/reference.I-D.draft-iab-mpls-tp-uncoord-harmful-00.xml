<abstract><t>This document identifies various types of damage that may occur without formal coordination and joint development on protocols of mutual interest between standards development organizations.  The IAB has selected T-MPLS as recent case study to describe hazard to both the MPLS and Internet architecture as a result of uncoordinated adaptation of a protocol.  This experience has resulted in a considerable improvement in the relationship between the two organisations.  In particular, this was achieved via the establishment of the "Joint working team on MPLS-TP" which was the first ever joint ITU/IETF group.  In addition, the leadership of the two organisations have agreed to improve inter- organizational working practices so as to avoid conflict in future between ITU-T Recommendations and IETF RFCs.</t></abstract>
