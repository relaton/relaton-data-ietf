<abstract><t>This document introduces the distributed NFV (D-NFV) concept based on potential implementation in scattered locations including customer edge devices and transport network equipments.  The motivation of pushing NFV entities from conventional centralized infrastructures to distributed promises is discussed, which are driven by the requirements of high flexibility, low end-to-end latency and faster time-to-market in future network.  To better understand the D-NFV concept, examples of D-NFV implementation is introduced.  Potential use cases are also described as references for readers.  Gaps have also been recognized in the documents in terms of the investigation of appropriate virtualization technologies used in the D-NFV and corresponding management and orchestration challenges.</t></abstract>
