<abstract><t>In order to provide roaming services, it is necessary to have a standardized method for identifying users.  This document defines the syntax for the Network Access Identifier (NAI), the user identity submitted by the client during network authentication.  "Roaming" may be loosely defined as the ability to use any one of multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs), while maintaining a formal, customer-vendor relationship with only one.  Examples of where roaming capabilities might be required include ISP "confederations" and ISP-provided corporate network access support.  This document is a revised version of RFC 4282 [RFC4282], which addresses issues with international character sets, as well as a number of other corrections to the previous document.</t></abstract>
