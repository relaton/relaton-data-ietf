<abstract><t>This document describes an operational problem that arises due to the impossibility of managing the address generation policy employed by hosts participating in IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  Additionally, it specifies a new field in the Prefix Information option of Router Advertisement messages, such that routers can advertise, for each network prefix included in a Router Advertisement message, the desired address generation policy to be used for SLAAC.</t></abstract>
