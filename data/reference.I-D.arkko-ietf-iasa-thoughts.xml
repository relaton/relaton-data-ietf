<abstract><t>This short memo outlines the author's thoughts about the challenges and opportunities with the IETF's administrative support activities, currently organised as part of the IETF Administrative Support Activities (IASA), IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC), and IETF Trust.  This memo is just input for discussion that the IETF community should have.  The memo is a part of the author's goal to document the status and various challenges and opportunities in the context of the so called "IASA 2.0" project.  The memo has no particular official standing, nor does it claim to represent more than the authors' thinking at the time of writing.</t></abstract>
