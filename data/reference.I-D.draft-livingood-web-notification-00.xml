<abstract><t>The objective of this document is to describe one method of providing notifications to web browsers being developed by Comcast, a large Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Such a notification system can be used by an ISP to provide near-immediate notifications to their users, such as to warn them that their traffic exhibits patterns that are indicative of malware or virus infection, for example.  There are many proprietary systems that can perform such notifications on the market today, some of which use inline-based Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) systems.  This document describes one example of such a system that does not rely upon DPI systems, and is instead based in open standards and open source systems.  While the system described herein is in some ways specific to the DOCSIS networks used by most cable- based broadband ISPs, components and concepts described in this document can generally be applied to many different types of networks.</t></abstract>
