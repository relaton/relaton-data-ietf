<abstract><t>This document extends SIP with two header fields and associated option tags that can be used in INVITE requests to convey the requester's preference for user-interface handling related to answering of that request.  The first header, &quot;Answer-Mode&quot;, expresses a preference as to whether the target node's user interface waits for user input before accepting the request or, instead, accepts the request without waiting on user input.  The second header, &quot;Priv-Answer-Mode&quot;, is similar to the first, except that it requests administrative-level access and has consequent additional authentication and authorization requirements.  These behaviors have applicability to applications such as push-to-talk and to diagnostics like loop-back.  Usage of each header field in a response to indicate how the request was handled is also defined.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
