<abstract><t>This document describes a NSIS Inter-domain QoS Model (InterDomain-QOSM) for realizing automatic inter-domain QoS interactions between adjacent network domains in a standardized and dynamic way to facilitate the end-to-end QoS provisioning over a chain of heterogeneous network domains. Specifically, it adopts the idea of distinct separation between the intra-domain QoS control plane and the inter-domain QoS control plane at each administrative domain and aims at standardizing the interface between the intra-domain and inter-domain QoS control planes within a domain and implementing the inter-domain QoS control plane as well as the inter-domain interface between peer inter-domain control planes by specifying the InterDomain-QOSM. Furthermore, the interactions between the intra-domain and inter-domain control planes via the standardized interface are also described in detail when the NSIS (e.g., the RMD-QOSM or Y.1541-QOSM) is deployed as the intra-domain QoS control solution.</t></abstract>
