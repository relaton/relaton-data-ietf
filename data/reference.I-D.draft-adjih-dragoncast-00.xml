<abstract><t>This document describes a Network Coding (NC) based broadcast protocol suitable mainly for wireless networks, including mobile ad hoc networks (MANET).  It provides data dissemination from a single source, based on intra-flow network coding and for Internet Protocol (IP).  It is designed to minimize the assumptions over the working environment and thus may operates over dynamically evolving environments.</t></abstract>
