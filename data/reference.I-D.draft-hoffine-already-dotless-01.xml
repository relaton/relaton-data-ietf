<abstract><t>Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board and ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee have discussed the problems that the DNS is likely to experience with top-level domains that have address records in them (so-called "dotless domains").  However, these statements spoke of the problem mostly as theoretical, when in fact there are such TLDs today.  This document lists the current dotless TLDs, and gives a script for finding them.  This document lists data about dotless TLDs, but does not address the policy and technology issues other than to point to the statements of others.</t></abstract>
