<abstract><t>This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid' namespace identifier.  The purpose of the standard is to support general exact referencing method which includes support for references to archives with restricted access, for exact references to existing web material, and for exact specification of elements in a web corpus (possibly spanning over several web archives).  The PWID URN therefore offers a scheme to make references that are not currently supported.  The PWID is designed for researchers and therefore it is designed as general, global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic, persistent and precise web references for web materials in web archives, and in a way that can make them potentially resolvable.</t></abstract>
