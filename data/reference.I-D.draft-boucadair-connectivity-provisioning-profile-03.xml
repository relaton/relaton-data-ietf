<abstract><t>This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP) and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP connectivity requirements to be met within a service delivery context (e.g., Voice over IP or IP TV).  The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by the underlying transport network together with a reachability scope and bandwidth/capacity needs.  Appropriate performance metrics such as one-way delay or one-way delay variation are used to characterize an IP transfer service.  Both global and restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.  Such a generic CPP template is meant to (1) facilitate the automation of the service negotiation and activation procedures, thus accelerating service provisioning, (2) set (traffic) objectives of Traffic Engineering functions and service management functions and (3) improve service and network management systems with 'decision- making' capabilities based upon negotiated/offered CPPs.</t></abstract>
