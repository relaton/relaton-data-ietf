<abstract><t>The two predominant circuit types used by link state routing protocols are point-to-point and broadcast.  It is important to identify the correct circuit type when forming adjacencies, flooding link state database packets, and representing the circuit topologically.  This document describes a simple mechanism to treat the broadcast network as a point-to-point connection from the standpoint of IP routing.  This memo provides information for the  Internet community.</t></abstract>
