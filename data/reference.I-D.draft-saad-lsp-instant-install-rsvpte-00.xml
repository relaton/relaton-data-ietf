<abstract><t>When establishing new RSVP-TE LSPs, it is permissible that LSRs along the LSP path to forward the RSVP Resv message upstream before installing the forwarding state.  In practise, this is done to parallelize the forwarding state installation.  While the ingress can start to use the LSP as soon as the RSVP Resv message arrives, doing so may lead to traffic drops at intermediate LSRs that may not have completed the installation of forwarding state for the new LSP.  This document describes procedures and provides extensions to RSVP-TE protocol to allow an ingress LSR to immediately install and forward traffic on a newly signalled LSP as soon as the RSVP reservation state is received.</t></abstract>
