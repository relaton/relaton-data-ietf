<abstract><t>BGP is a core part of a network including Software-Defined Networking (SDN) system.  It has the traffic engineering information on the network topology and can compute optimal paths for a given traffic flow acrosss the network.  This document describes the architecture for BGP as a central controller.  A BGP-based central controller can simplify the operations on the network and use network resources efficiently for providing services with high quality.</t></abstract>
