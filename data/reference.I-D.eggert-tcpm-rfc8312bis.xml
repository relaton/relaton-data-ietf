<abstract><t>CUBIC is an extension to the current TCP standards.  It differs from the current TCP standards only in the congestion control algorithm on the sender side.  In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of a linear window increase function of the current TCP standards to improve scalability and stability under fast and long-distance networks.  CUBIC and its predecessor algorithm have been adopted as defaults by Linux and have been used for many years.  This document provides a specification of CUBIC to enable third-party implementations and to solicit community feedback through experimentation on the performance of CUBIC.  This documents obsoletes [RFC8312], updating the specification of CUBIC to conform to the current Linux version.</t></abstract>
