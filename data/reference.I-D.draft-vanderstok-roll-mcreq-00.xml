<abstract><t>This is a working document intended to focus discussion on requirements for multicast in Low-power and Lossy Networks in the area of M2M communication for control purposes.  The Trickle algorithm, which uses re-broadcasting to assure that messages arrive at all destinations, is proposed as the ROLL multicast protocol.  In this draft additional requirements on Trickle, such as timeliness and ordering, are motivated by building control.  Re-broadcasting and timeliness can be mutually exclusive properties.  To alleviate that problem, this draft considers the possibility of reducing interference by limiting the number of transmission paths between any two devices in the mesh.</t></abstract>
