<abstract><t>FTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands that are IPv4-specific, and in extended, IP version agnostic commands. The only FTP mode that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4 translator is extended passive However, many existing FTP servers don't support this mode, and some clients don't ask for it.  This document describes the optimal server, client and middlebox (if any) behavior to minimize this problem.</t></abstract>
