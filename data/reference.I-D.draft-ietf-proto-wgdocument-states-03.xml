<abstract><t>This document defines different states that an Internet-Draft (I-D) may be in while associated with an IETF working group.  The first state describes an I-D that is being considered for adoption by a working group.  One of several possible last states describes an I-D that has been sent to the IESG for publication.  The IETF Datatracker tool will be enhanced to make it possible for working group chairs to indicate the status of working group documents in order to provide more feedback and transparency to document authors and to the IETF community.  Appendix A describes different states used by IETF Area Directors to indicate the status of I-Ds sent to the IESG for review and publication.</t></abstract>
