<abstract><t>This document proposes a mechanism to run BFD on Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interfaces.  It does so by running an independent BFD session on every LAG member link.  A dedicated well-known multicast IP address for both IPv4 and IPv6 is introduced as the destination IP address of the BFD packets when running BFD on the member links of the LAG.  There is currently also no standard that describes how BFD runs on a LAG interface as a whole.  This draft proposes a definition for this problem too while taking into consideration existing implementations.</t></abstract>
