<abstract><t>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) defined by RFC 3261.  The purpose of this extension is to provide an extensible framework by which SIP nodes can request notification from remote nodes indicating that certain events have occurred.</t><t>Note that the event notification mechanisms defined herein are NOT intended to be a general-purpose infrastructure for all classes of event subscription and notification.</t><t>This document represents a backwards-compatible improvement on the original mechanism described by RFC 3265, taking into account several years of implementation experience.  Accordingly, this document obsoletes RFC 3265.  This document also updates RFC 4660 slightly to accommodate some small changes to the mechanism that were discussed in that document.
