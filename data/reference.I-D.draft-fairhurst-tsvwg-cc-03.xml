<abstract><t>This document provides guidance on the design of methods to avoid congestion collapse and to provide congestion control. Recommendations and requirements on this topic are distributed across many documents in the RFC series.  This therefore seeks to gather and consolidate these recommendations.  It is intended to provide input to the design of new congestion control methods in protocols, such as IETF QUIC.  The present document is for discussion and comment by the IETF.  If published, this plans to update the Best Current Practice in BCP 41, which currently includes "Congestion Control Principles" provided in RFC2914.</t></abstract>
