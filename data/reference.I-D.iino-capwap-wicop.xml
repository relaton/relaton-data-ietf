<abstract><t>The popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) has led to wide spread deployments across different establishments.  It has also translated in to increasing scale of the WLANs.  Large-scale deployments made of large numbers of wireless termination points (WTPs) and covering substantial areas are increasingly common.  The Wireless LAN Control Protocol (WiCoP) described in this document allows for the control and provisioning of large-scale WLANs.  It enables central management of these networks and realizes the objectives set forth for the control and provisioning of wireless access points (CAPWAP).</t></abstract>
