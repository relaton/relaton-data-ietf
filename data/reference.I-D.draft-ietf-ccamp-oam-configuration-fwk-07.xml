<abstract><t>OAM is an integral part of transport connections, hence it is required that OAM functions are activated/deactivated in sync with connection commissioning/decommissioning; avoiding spurious alarms and ensuring consistent operation.  In certain technologies OAM entities are inherently established once the connection is set up, while other technologies require extra configuration to establish and configure OAM entities.  This document specifies extensions to RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration of OAM entities along with LSP signaling.</t></abstract>
