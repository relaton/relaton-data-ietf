<abstract><t>This document describes the methodology for benchmarking Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminology document [Po06]. The methodology and terminology are to be used for benchmarking signaling plane performance with varying signaling and media load. Both scale and establishment rate are measured by signaling plane performance. The SIP Devices to be benchmarked may be a single device under test (DUT) or a system under test (SUT). Benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, P-CSCF, and Server paired with a Firewall/NAT device.</t></abstract>
