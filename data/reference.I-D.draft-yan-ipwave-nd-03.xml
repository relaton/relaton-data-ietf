<abstract><t>For C-ACC, platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, direct IP communication between neighbor vehicles poses the following two issues: 1) how to discover the neighbor vehicle and the demanded service; and 2) how to discover the link-layer address of the neighbor vehicle and selected server.  This draft presents a solution to these problems based on DNS-SD/mDNS [RFC6762][RFC6763].</t></abstract>
