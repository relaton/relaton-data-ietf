<abstract><t>The proposed 3GPP's 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) offers flexibility to introduce new user and control plane function within the context of network slicing that allows greater flexibility to handle heterogeneous devices and applications.  In this draft, we provide a short description of the proposed 5GC, followed by extensions to 5GC's control and user plane to support packet data unit (PDU) sessions from information-centric networks.  The value of enabling ICN in 5GC is discussed using two service scenarios which include mobile edge computing and support for seamless mobility for ICN sessions.</t></abstract>
