<abstract><t>MPLS-TE Graceful Shutdown is a method for explicitly notifying the nodes in a Traffic Engineering (TE) enabled network that the TE capability on a link or on an entire Label Switching Router (LSR) is going to be disabled.  MPLS-TE graceful shutdown mechanisms are tailored toward addressing planned outage in the network.</t><t>This document provides requirements and protocol mechanisms to reduce or eliminate traffic disruption in the event of a planned shutdown of a network resource.  These operations are equally applicable to both MPLS-TE and its Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extensions.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
