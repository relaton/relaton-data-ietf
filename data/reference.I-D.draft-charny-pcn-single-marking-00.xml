<abstract><t>Pre-Congestion Notification [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] approach proposes the use of an Admission Control mechanism to limit the amount of real-time PCN traffic to a configured level during the normal operating conditions, and the use of a Pre-emption mechanism to tear-down some of the flows to bring the PCN traffic level down to a desirable amount during unexpected events such as network failures, with the goal of maintaining the QoS assurances to the remaining flows. In [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture], Admission and Pre- emption use two different markings and two different metering mechanisms in the internal nodes of the PCN region. This draft proposes a mechanism using a single marking and metering for both Admission and Pre-emption, and presents a preliminary analysis of the tradeoffs. A side-effect of this proposal that a different marking and metering Admission mechanism than that proposed [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] may be also feasible.</t></abstract>
