<abstract><t>The NSIS operation will be greatly affected by the multihoming development in IETF such as Monami6, Shim6, etc. Solutions from these groups introduce different architecture elements and assumptions to the network layer, and thus render the current NSIS protocols ineffective or irrelevant. This draft provides an analysis of the multhoming scenarios that have impacts on the NSIS operation. Requirements for NSIS multihoming support are derived from the discussions of the NSIS applicability in these scenarios.</t></abstract>
