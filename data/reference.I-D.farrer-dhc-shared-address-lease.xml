<abstract><t>This memo describes an update to [RFC2131], which enables the dynamic leasing of shared IPv4 addresses and layer 4 source ports to DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 clients [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].  Shared addressing allows a single IPv4 address to be allocated to multiple, active clients simulataneously.  Clients sharing the same address are then differentiated by unique L4 source ports.</t></abstract>
