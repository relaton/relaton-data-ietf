<abstract><t>This document describes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) mechanism that provides basic IP multicast forwarding suitable for wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) use.  SMF defines techniques for multicast duplicate packet detection (DPD) to be applied in the forwarding process and includes maintenance and checking operations for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocol use.  SMF also specifies mechanisms for applying reduced relay sets to achieve more efficient multicast data distribution within a mesh topology versus simple flooding.  The document describes interactions with other protocols and multiple deployment approaches.  Distributed algorithms for selecting reduced relay sets and related discussion are provided in the Appendices.  Basic issues relating to the operation of multicast MANET border routers are discussed but ongoing work remains in this area beyond the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
