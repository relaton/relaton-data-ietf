<abstract><t>This document specifies XS:xml-search, a search grammar for use with the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) SEARCH protocol. XS:xml-search extends the DAV:basicsearch grammar with XPath expressions which are evaluated on properties whose values are XML fragments. The full expression power of XPath may exceed the requirement in simple use cases, therefore some provisions are made in order to reduce the cost of implementing this specification, as well as the computational cost of evaluating allowed queries.</t></abstract>
