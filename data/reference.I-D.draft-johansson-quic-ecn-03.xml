<abstract><t>This memo outlines the ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) support in QUIC.  The draft specifies the ECN negotiation and the ECN echo and in addition, different aspects of fallback in case of ECN failure as well as OS specific issues with ECN and monitoring for ECN capability.  The intention is that most of the material ends up updating other new or existing QUIC protocol specifications, thus it may be possible that this draft does not warrant a working group status.</t></abstract>
