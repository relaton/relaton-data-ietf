<abstract><t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.  This document specifies a mechanism that will allow an end user to determine the trusted key state of the resolvers that handle the user's DNS queries.</t></abstract>
