<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained devices and networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g.  in a building automation scenario all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off as a group).  This document provides guidance for how the CoAP protocol should be used in a group communication context.  An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed for both constrained and un-constrained networks.  Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in various network topologies.</t></abstract>
