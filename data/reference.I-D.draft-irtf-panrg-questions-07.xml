<abstract><t>In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware internetworking architecture has two important properties: it exposes the properties of available Internet paths to endpoints, and provides for endpoints and applications to use these properties to select paths through the Internet for their traffic.  This document poses questions in path-aware networking open as of 2020, that must be answered in the design, development, and deployment of path-aware internetworks.  It was originally written to frame discussions in the Path Aware Networking proposed Research Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot current thinking in this space.</t></abstract>
