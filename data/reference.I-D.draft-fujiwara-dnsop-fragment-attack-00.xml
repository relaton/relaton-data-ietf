<abstract><t>Researchers proposed DNS cache poisoning attacks using IP fragmentation.  This document shows feasible and adequate measures at full-service resolvers against these attacks.  To protect resolvers from these attacks, avoid fragmentation (limit requestor's UDP payload size to 1220/1232), drop fragmented UDP DNS responses and use TCP at resolver side.</t></abstract>
