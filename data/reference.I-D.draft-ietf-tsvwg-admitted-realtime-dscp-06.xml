<abstract><t>This document requests one Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for real-time traffic classes similar to voice conforming to the Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior, and admitted using a call admission procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission.  This document also recommends that certain classes of video traffic described in RFC 4594 and which have similar requirements be changed to require admission using a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission.</t></abstract>
