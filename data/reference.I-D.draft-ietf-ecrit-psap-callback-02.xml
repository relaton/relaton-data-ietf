<abstract><t>After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminated by the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possible that the call-taker feels the need for further communication or for a clarification.  For example, the call may have been dropped by accident without the call-taker having sufficient information about the current situation of a wounded person.  A call-taker may trigger a callback towards the emergency caller using the contact information provided with the initial emergency call.  This callback could, under certain circumstances, then be treated like any other call and as a consequence, it may get blocked by authorization policies or may get forwarded to an answering machine.  The IETF emergency services architecture addresses callbacks in a limited fashion and thereby covers a couple of scenarios.  This document discusses some shortcomings and illustrates an extension.</t></abstract>
