<abstract><t>Neighbor discovery(ND) proxies provide a method for bridging multiple links into a single subnet.  They do this by modifying the neighbor discovery signaling passing through them.  SEND provides a way of securing neighbor discovery signaling so that receiving nodes can detect if the neighbor discovery packets have been tampered with. This leads to SEND and ND proxies being unable to coexist with each other.  This document proposes a method for these to co-exist.</t></abstract>
