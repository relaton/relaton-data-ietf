<abstract><t>Traffic Engineered (TE) networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane.  They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources.  These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking.  The term &quot;Traffic Engineered network&quot; refers to a network that uses any connection-oriented technology under the control of a distributed or centralized control plane to support dynamic provisioning of end-to- end connectivity.</t><t>Abstraction of network resources is a technique that can be applied to a single network domain or across multiple domains to create a single virtualized network that is under the control of a network operator or the customer of the operator that actually owns the network resources.</t><t>This document provides a framework for Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) to support virtual network services and connectivity services.</t></abstract>
