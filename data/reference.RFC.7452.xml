<abstract><t>The term &quot;Internet of Things&quot; (IoT) denotes a trend where a large number of embedded devices employ communication services offered by Internet protocols.  Many of these devices, often called &quot;smart                    objects&quot;, are not directly operated by humans but exist as components in buildings or vehicles, or are spread out in the environment. Following the theme &quot;Everything that can be connected will be                      connected&quot;, engineers and researchers designing smart object networks need to decide how to achieve this in practice.</t><t>This document offers guidance to engineers designing Internet- connected smart objects.</t></abstract>
