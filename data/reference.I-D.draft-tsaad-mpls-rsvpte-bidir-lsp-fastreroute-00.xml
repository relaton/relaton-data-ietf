<abstract><t>This document defines RSVP-TE signaling extensions to support Fast Reroute (FRR) of bidirectional co-routed Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs. These extensions enable the re-direction of bi-directional traffic and signaling onto bypass tunnels that ensure co-routedness of data and signaling paths in the forward and reverse directions after FRR. In addition, the RSVP-TE signaling extensions allow the coordination of bypass tunnel assignment protecting a common facility in both forward and reverse directions prior to or post failure occurrence.</t></abstract>
