<abstract><t>The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of the DSField in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet header to carry the Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of assigned DSCP values.  This update to RFC2474 changes the IANA assignment method for Pool 3 of the registry (i.e., DSCPs of the form xxxx01) to Standards Action, i.e., values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFC. The update also removes permission for experimental and Local Use of the codepoints that form Pool 3 of the DSCP registry; Pool 1 codepoints (i.e., DSCPs of the form xxxx11) remain available for these purposes.</t></abstract>
