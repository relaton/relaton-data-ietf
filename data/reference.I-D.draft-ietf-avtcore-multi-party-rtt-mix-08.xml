<abstract><t>Real-time text mixers for multi-party sessions need to identify the source of each transmitted group of text so that the text can be presented by endpoints in suitable grouping with other text from the same source.  Regional regulatory requirements specify provision of real-time text in multi-party calls.  RFC 4103 mixer implementations can use traditional RTP functions for source identification, but the mixer source switching performance is limited when using the default transmission characteristics with redundancy.  Enhancements for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing is provided in this document, suitable for a centralized conference model that enables source identification and source switching.  The intended use is for real-time text mixers and multi-party-aware participant endpoints. The specified mechanism build on the standard use of the CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification.  The method makes use of the same "text/red" format as for two-party sessions.  A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a participant can handle the multi-party coded real-time text stream. The capability is indicated by use of a media attribute "rtt-mix-rtp- mixer".  The document updates RFC 4103[RFC4103]  A specifications of how a mixer can format text for the case when the endpoint is not multi-party aware is also provided.</t></abstract>
