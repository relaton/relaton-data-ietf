<abstract><t>Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and TRILL are two emerging standards in the data center environment. While these two protocols are seemingly unrelated, they have a very similar behavior in the forwarding plane, as both perform hop-by-hop forwarding over Ethernet, modifying the packet's MAC addresses at each hop. This document describes an architecture for the integrated deployment of these two protocols.</t></abstract>
