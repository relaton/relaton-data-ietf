<abstract><t>This document describes service classes configured with Diffserv, recommends how they can be used and how to construct them using Differentiated Service Code Points (DSCP), traffic conditioners, Per- Hop Behaviors (PHB), and Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms. There is no intrinsic requirement that particular DSCPs, traffic conditioners, PHBs, and AQM be used for a certain service class, but as a policy and for interoperability it is useful to apply them consistently.</t></abstract>
