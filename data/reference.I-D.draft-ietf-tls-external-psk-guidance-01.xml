<abstract><t>This document provides usage guidance for external Pre-Shared Keys (PSKs) in TLS.  It lists TLS security properties provided by PSKs under certain assumptions and demonstrates how violations of these assumptions lead to attacks.  This document also discusses PSK use cases, provisioning processes, and TLS stack implementation support in the context of these assumptions.  It provides advice for applications in various use cases to help meet these assumptions. Privacy and security properties not provided by PSKs are also included.</t></abstract>
