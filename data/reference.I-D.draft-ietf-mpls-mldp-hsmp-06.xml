<abstract><t>This draft introduces a hub &amp; spoke multipoint (HSMP) Label Switched Path (LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSP and also leaf to root along the reverse path.  That means traffic entering the HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root node travels downstream to each leaf node, exactly as if it is travelling downstream along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node.  Upstream traffic entering the HSMP LSP at any leaf node travels upstream along the tree to the root, as if it is unicast to the root.  Direct communication among the leaf nodes is not allowed.</t></abstract>
