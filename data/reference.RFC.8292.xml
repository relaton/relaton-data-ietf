<abstract><t>An application server can use the Voluntary Application Server Identification (VAPID) method described in this document to voluntarily identify itself to a push service.  The &quot;vapid&quot; authentication scheme allows a client to include its identity in a signed token with requests that it makes.  The signature can be used by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server to a single entity.  The identification information can allow the operator of a push service to contact the operator of the application server.  The signature can be used to restrict the use of a push message subscription to a single application server.</t></abstract>
