<abstract><t>Dual-Stack lite has been proposed as a IPv4 to IPv6 transition technology.  Dual-stack lite allows a service provider to migrate his network to IPv6, while still offering IPv4 services to the end customer.  The dual-stack lite solution uses an IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel between a host (or access device) and a dual-stack lite large scale NAT.  Several existing network architectures (e.g. 3GPP, WiMAX, or PPP based broadband networks) already specify dual-stack deployment and leverage tunneling technology between the access device and an access gateway in the provider network.  Applying the existing dual- stack lite concept to these networks will result in changes to the end-system and unnecessary tunneling overhead.  This draft describes a modified implementation of dual-stack lite where existing access tunnels are extended beyond the access gateway to the dual-stack lite large scale NAT using softwires.  This evolved approach applies to IPv4 as well as IPv6 networks.</t></abstract>
