<title>Adding Support for Salted Password Databases to EAP-pwd</title>

<abstract><t>EAP-pwd is an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method that utilizes a shared password for authentication using a technique that is resistant to dictionary attacks.  It includes support for raw keys and double hashing of a password in the style of Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MSCHAPv2), but it does not include support for salted passwords.  There are many existing databases of salted passwords, and it is desirable to allow their use with EAP-pwd.</t></abstract>
