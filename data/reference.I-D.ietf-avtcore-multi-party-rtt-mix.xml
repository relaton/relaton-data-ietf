<abstract><t>Enhancements for RFC 4103 real-time text mixing are provided in this document, suitable for a centralized conference model that enables source identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text from different sources.  The intended use is for real-time text mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing an efficient presentation or other treatment of a multi-party real-time text session.  The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the CSRC list in the RTP packet for source identification.  The method makes use of the same &quot;text/t140&quot; and &quot;text/red&quot; formats as for two- party sessions.</t><t> Solutions using multiple RTP streams in the same RTP session are briefly mentioned, as they could have some benefits over the RTP- mixer model.  The possibility to implement the solution in a wide range of existing RTP implementations made the RTP-mixer model be selected to be fully specified in this document.</t><t> A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a mixer and a participant can handle the multi-party coded real-time text stream using the RTP-mixer method.  The capability is indicated by use of an SDP media attribute &quot;rtt-mixer&quot;.</t><t> The document updates RFC 4103 &quot;RTP Payload for Text Conversation&quot;.</t><t> A specification of how a mixer can format text for the case when the endpoint is not multi-party aware is also provided.</t></abstract>
