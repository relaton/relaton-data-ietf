<abstract><t>RBridges provide optimal pair-wise forwarding with zero configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. They achieve these goals using IS-IS routing and encapsulation of traffic with a header that includes a hop count.  RBridges are compatible with previous IEEE 802.1 customer bridges as well as IPv4 and IPv6 routers and end nodes. They are as invisible to current IP routers as bridges are and, like routers, they terminate the bridge spanning tree protocol.  The design supports VLANs and optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLAN and IP derived multicast groups.  It also allows forwarding tables to be based on RBridge destinations (rather than end node destinations), which allows internal forwarding tables to be substantially smaller than in conventional bridge systems.</t></abstract>
