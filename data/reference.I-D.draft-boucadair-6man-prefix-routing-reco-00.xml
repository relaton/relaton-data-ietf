<abstract><t>The length of IP prefixes to be manipulated by forwarding and routing processes is policy-based; no maximum length must be assumed by design.  This document sketches a recommendation to be followed by forwarding and routing designs with regards to the prefix length. The aim is to avoid hard-coded routing and forwarding designs that exclude some IP prefix lengths.</t></abstract>
