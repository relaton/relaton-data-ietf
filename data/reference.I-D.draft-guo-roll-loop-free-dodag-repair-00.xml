<abstract><t>IETF has been developing IPv6 based standards for Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) to meet requirements of constrained applications, such as field monitoring, inventory control and so on. IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) has been published in [RFC6550]. Based on routing metrics and constraints [RFC6551], RPL builds Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to establish bidirectional routes for LLNs for traffic types of multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-point. RPL routes are optimized for traffic to or from one or more roots that act as sinks. As a result, a DAG is partitioned into one or more Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), one DODAG per sink. RPL is widely considered as a feasible routing protocol for LLNs. However, DODAG loops caused by local DODAG repair mechanism is an issues to be addressed. This draft introduces a loop free local DODAG repair mechanism.</t></abstract>
