<abstract><t>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financial information networks (e.g. stock market data providers), network performance criteria (e.g. latency) are becoming as critical to data path selection as other metrics.  This document describes extensions to IS-IS TE [RFC5305] such that network performance information can be distributed and collected in a scalable fashion. The information distributed using ISIS TE Express Path can then be used to make path selection decisions based on network performance.  Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network performance information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring network performance or acting on that information, once distributed, are outside the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
