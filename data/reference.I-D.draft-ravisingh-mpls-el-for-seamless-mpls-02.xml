<abstract><t>This document describes certain optimizations to how entropy labels can be used for load balancing in a seamless MPLS architecture, as enabled by LSP concatenation and LSP hierarchies.  The definition of the control plane and data plane behavior at LSP concatenation points; and at the ingress of an LSP in a hierarchy of LSPs, as described in this document, brings the benefits of entropy labels to certain deployment scenarios that may not have had such benefits as specified in [EL-RFC].  This document, if approved, updates RFC 6790.</t></abstract>
