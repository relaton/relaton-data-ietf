<abstract><t>Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across multiple domains in Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks presents a problem because no single point of path computation is aware of all of the links and resources in each domain. A solution may be achieved using the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture.  Where the sequence of domains is known, a priori, various techniques can be employed to derive an optimum path. If the domains are simply- connected, or if the preferred points of interconnection are also known, the Per-Domain Path Computation technique can be used. Where there are multiple connections between domains and there is no preference for the choice of points of interconnection, the Backward Recursive Path Computation Procedure (BRPC) can be used.  This document examines techniques to establish the optimum path when the sequence of domains is not known in advance. The document  provides mechanisms that allow the optimum sequence of domains to be selected and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived.</t></abstract>
