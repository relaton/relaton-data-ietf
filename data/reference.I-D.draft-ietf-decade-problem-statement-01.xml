<abstract><t>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the Internet today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  In P2P applications, one technique for reducing the total amount of P2P traffic is to introduce storage capabilities within the network.  Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web caches) provide such storage, but they are complex (due to explicitly supporting individual P2P application protocols) and they do not allow users to manage access to content in the cache.  For example, Content Providers cannot easily control access and resource usage policies to satisfy their own requirements.  This document discusses the introduction of in-network storage for P2P applications, shows the need for a standard protocol for accessing this storage, and identifies the scope of this protocol.  The accessing protocol can also be used by other applications with similar requirements.</t></abstract>
