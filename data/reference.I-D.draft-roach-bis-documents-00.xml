<abstract><t>This document discusses mechanisms the IETF has historically used for updating RFCs subsequent to their publication, and outlines an updated procedure for publishing newer versions (colloquially known as "bis versions") that is appropriate in certain circumstances. This procedure is expected to be easier for both authors and consumers of RFCs.</t></abstract>
