<abstract><t>This memo specifies how to support RTP packet stream thinning (or rate adaptation) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) running over UDP to make effect in parallel with reliable RTCP report to the RTP sender.  It introduces "dummy RTP packets" into the single-session transmission (SST) mode for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) and Multiview Video Coding (MVC). The reactions of RTP receivers upon receiving the "dummy RTP packets" are defined.  The document also recommend to extend the ECN functionalities based on the scalability feature of SVC and MVC.</t></abstract>
