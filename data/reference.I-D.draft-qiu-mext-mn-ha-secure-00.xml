<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 (and DSMIP6) rely on IPsec for securing the signaling between the MN and HA.  However, the tight coupling of the mobility protocol with IPsec is detrimental to broader implementation and deployment.  This draft propose a scheme to authenticate the mobile node and signaling of home biding update to home agent as well as avoid the use of IPsec.</t></abstract>
