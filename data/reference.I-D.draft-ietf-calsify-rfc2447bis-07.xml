<abstract><t>This document, iCalendar Message-Based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP), specifies a binding from the iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) to Internet email-based transports. Calendaring entries defined by the iCalendar Object Model (iCAL) are wrapped using constructs from RFC 5322, RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047 and RFC 2049, and then transported over SMTP.  This document is a product of the Calendaring and Scheduling Standards Simplification (calsify) working group. More information about the IETF CALSIFY working group activities can be found on the IETF web site at &lt;http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsify- charter.html>.  The issue tracker for the Calsify WG is located at: &lt;http://www.ofcourseimright.com/cgi-bin/roundup/calsify></t></abstract>
