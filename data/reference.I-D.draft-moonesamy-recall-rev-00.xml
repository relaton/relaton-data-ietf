<abstract><t>The procedures for initiating a recall specified in RFC 7437 restrict signatories to those who are "nomcom qualified".  This document suggests those limitations were unanticipated and undesirable side- effects and proposes to remove them.  It also proposes that remote participants should be allowed to seek redress through the procedures and decreases the number of signatories required for a recall petition.  This document is intended to update RFC 7437.</t></abstract>
