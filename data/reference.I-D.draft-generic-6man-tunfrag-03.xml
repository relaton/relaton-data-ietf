<abstract><t>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.  Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMP Packet Too Big message or perform link-specific fragmentation (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below IPv6.  This latter category of links is often performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link-specific fragmentation and reassembly to the point that it would be highly desirable to push the workload back to the IPv6 communication endpoints.  A common case that exhibits these link characteristics is seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels.  Additionally, IPv6 nodes could better adapt to path MTUs of various sizes by using either a small amount of host-based fragmentation and/or path probing as necessary.This document therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better accommodate path MTU issues.</t></abstract>
