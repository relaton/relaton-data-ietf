<abstract><t>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is designed for a severe environment where communication quality is not guaranteed. It works as an overlay network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) and some convergence layer protocols like Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP). However, there is no mechanism in both BP and LTP Protocol to ensure integrity of a packet with the granularity of bit. Since the integrity is crucial for packet transmission and necessary metadata consumes extra costs, there should be a strategy to decide which packets and how the packets are required to conduct integrity assurance based on network resources and user requirements. Hence, in this document, a hybrid integrity assurance strategy is proposed to ensure the different levels of integrity of bundles based on the status of network resources and the need of users.</t></abstract>
