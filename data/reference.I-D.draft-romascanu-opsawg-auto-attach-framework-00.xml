<abstract><t>This informational document describes a method that allows for the automatic attachment of network objects (e.g. end stations, network devices, sensors, automation elements) to a core network based on the individual services that are run or configured on the objects, and the mapping of the services to the managed paths in the network. The framework proposed by this document describes the operations that need to happen in order to have the network objects connected to the network ('attached') in an automatic manner and start providing their functionality and services without any requirement or dependency between the protocol stack on the network objects and the method used to build the bridging or routing paths in the network core.</t></abstract>
