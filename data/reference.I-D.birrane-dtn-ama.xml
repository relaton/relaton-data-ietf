<abstract><t>This document describes an asynchronous management architecture (AMA) suitable for providing application-level network management services in a challenged networking environment.  Challenged networks are those that require fault protection, configuration, and performance reporting while unable to provide humans-in-the-loop with synchronous feedback or otherwise preserve transport-layer sessions.  In such a context, networks must exhibit behavior that is both determinable and autonomous while maintaining compatibility with existing network management protocols and operational concepts.</t></abstract>
