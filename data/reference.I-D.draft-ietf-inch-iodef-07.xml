<abstract><t>The purpose of the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) is to define a data representation that provides a framework for sharing information commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents. The IODEF satisfies the requirements specified in RFCXXX [17] This Internet-Draft describes a data model for representing incident information exported from incident handling systems managed by CSIRTs. An implementation of the data model in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) is presented, an XML Document Type Definition is developed, and examples are provided.</t></abstract>
