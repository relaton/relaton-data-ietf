<abstract><t>This document analyses the state of Inter-Domain Routing (IDR) and the relationship between inter-domain and intra-domain routing.  The analysis is carried out with respect to RFC 1126 and other IDR requirements and design efforts as it appeared to be in 2001 with editorial additions reflecting developments up to 2006.  It is the companion document to "Requirements for Inter-Domain Routing" [I-D.irtf-routing-reqs], which is a discussion of requirements for the future routing architecture and future routing protocols.  This document summarizes discussions held several years ago by members of the IRTF Routing Research Group (IRTF RRG) and other interested parties.  The document is published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a record of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding that it does not necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the technical concensus of the research group at the date of publication. [Note to RFC Editor: Please replace the reference in the abstract with a non-reference quoting the RFC number of the companion document when it is allocated, i.e., '(RFC xxxx)' and remove this note.]</t></abstract>
