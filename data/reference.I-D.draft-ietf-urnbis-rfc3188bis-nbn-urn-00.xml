<abstract><t>National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are widely used by the national libraries and other organizations in order to identify various resources such as monographs pre-dating the emergence of the ISBN system or still images.  NBNs are applied to all kinds of resources that do not have an established identifier system of their own.  Since 2001, there has been a URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespace for NBNs, and during 2001-2009 millions of URN-based unique and persistent NBNs have been assigned.  The namespace registration was performed in RFC 3188 and applied to the NBNs known at that point. No URN:NBN resolution services existed at the time when the RFC was written.  Since then, several countries including Finland, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands have used URN:NBNs to identify electronic resources and to provide persistent links to them.  To this end, these countries have established URN:NBN resolution services that supply URN - URL linking.  This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be supported within the URN framework.  An updated namespace registration is included.</t></abstract>
