<abstract><t>Implementing the so called identifier / locator separation may have far-reaching consequences to the Internet architecture, depending very much on how exactly it is implemented. That is, here as in many other cases, the devil lies very much in the details. In this document, we attempt to outline the various aspects of the design space. We briefly discuss six main aspects: identifiers, dynamic traffic management, end-to-end issues, security, economics, and deployment. In this initial version of the document, we still lack many details. This document is a reaction to the problem statement effort at the Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop (RAWS).</t></abstract>
