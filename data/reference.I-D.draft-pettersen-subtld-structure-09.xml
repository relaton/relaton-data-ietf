<abstract><t>This document defines the term "Public Suffix domain" as meaning a domain under which multiple parties that are unaffiliated with the owner of the Public Suffix domain may register subdomains.  Examples of Public Suffix domains include "org", "co.uk", "k12.wa.us" and "uk.com".  It also defines a file format that can be used to distribute information about such Public Suffix domains to relying parties.  As an example, this information is then used to limit which domains an Internet service can set HTTP cookies for, strengthening the rules already defined by the cookie specification.  This specification updates RFC 6265 [RFC6265] by defining the term "Public Suffix domain".</t></abstract>
