<abstract><t>The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) suffers from the limitation of not having a means to quickly recover from a stale state known as dangling Security Associations (SA's) where one side has SA's that the corresponding party does not have anymore.  This Draft proposes to address the limitation by offering an immediate, DoS-free recovery mechanism for IKE.</t></abstract>
