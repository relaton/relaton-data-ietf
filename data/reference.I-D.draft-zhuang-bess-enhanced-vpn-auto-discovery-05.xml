<abstract><t>A variety of VPN technologies have been widely deployed to bear different services.  As new applications develop, a requirement has been proposed for auto-discovery of Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks (L3VPN) and enhanced auto-discovery requirements for other VPN technologies that already have basic auto-discovery mechanisms.  This document identifies some possible applications of these auto- discovery requirements and defines a new BGP NLRI, called the BGP- VPN-INSTANCE NLRI, to satisfy the requirement for auto-discovery of BGP VPN instances. It also defines a new type of extended community, called the Import Route Target, which can be applied to auto- discovery mechanisms of multiple VPN technologies.</t></abstract>
