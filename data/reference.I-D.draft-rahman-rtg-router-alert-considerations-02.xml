<abstract><t>The IP Router Alert Option is an IP option that alerts transit routers to more closely examine the contents of an IP packet.  RSVP, PGM, IGMP/MLD and MRD are some of the protocols which make use of the IP Router Alert option.  This document discusses security aspects, common practices and usage guidelines around the use of the current IP Router Alert option.  Specifically, it provides recommendations on the use of Router Alert by new protocols, discusses controlled environments where existing protocols depending on Router Alert can be used effectively and discusses protection approaches for Service Providers.  Finally it provides brief guidelines for Router Alert implementation on routers.</t></abstract>
