<abstract><t>Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery can use naming systems other than the Domain Name System when looking for services. Different name systems use different conventions for the characters allowed in any name.  In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively in environments where multiple different name systems are in use, it is important to follow a common set of conventions for naming.  This memo presents an outline of the reqiurements for selection of labels for mDNS and DNS when they are expected to interoperate in this manner.</t></abstract>
