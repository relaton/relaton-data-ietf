<abstract><t>BGP has been used to distribute different types of routing and policy information.  In some cases, the information distributed may be only intended for one or a particular group of BGP nodes in the network. Currently BGP does not have a generic mechanism of designating the target nodes of the routing information.  This document defines a new type of BGP Extended Community called "Node Target".  The mechanism of using the Node Target Extended Community to steer BGP route distribution to particular BGP nodes is specified.</t></abstract>
