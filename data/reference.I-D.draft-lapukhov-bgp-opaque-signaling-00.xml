<abstract><t>Border Gateway Protocol with multi-protocol extensions (MP-BGP) [RFC4760] enables the use of the protocol for dissemination of virtually any information.  This document proposes a new Address Family/Subsequent Address Family to be used for distribution of opaque data.  This functionality is intended to be used by applications other than BGP for exchange of their own data on top of BGP mesh.  The structure of such data is not to be interpreted by the regular BGP speakers, rather the goal is to use BGP purely as a convenient and scalable communication system.</t></abstract>
