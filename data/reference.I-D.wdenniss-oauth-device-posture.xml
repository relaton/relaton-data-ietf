<abstract><t>Enterprise and security focused OAuth providers typically want additional signals to confirm user presence when users return to previously authorized apps.  Rather than requiring a full reauthentication, or require enrollment in a mobile device management solution, some authorization servers may be willing to accept device posture signals from the app, like the fact that device has a lock screen, as confirmation of user presence.  This document details how OAuth native app clients can communicate device posture signals to OAuth providers.</t></abstract>
