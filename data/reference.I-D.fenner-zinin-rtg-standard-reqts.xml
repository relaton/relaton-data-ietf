<abstract><t>This document provides guidance for the advancement of the protocols produced within the IETF Routing Area. It places implementation and interoperability constraints on protocols earlier in the standards process than RFC 2026, based on RFC 2026's provision that the IESG may require implementation and/or operational experience prior to granting Proposed Standard status to a specification that materially affects the core Internet protocols or that specifies behavior that may have significant operational impact on the Internet. We also discuss the applicability of these rules to protocols and their extensions.</t></abstract>
