<abstract><t>WebRTC applications rely on ICE candidates to enable peer-to-peer connections between clients in as many network configurations as possible.  To maximize the probability to create a direct peer-to- peer connection, client private IP addresses are often exposed without user consent.  This is currently used as a way to track users.  This document describes a way to share IP addresses with other clients while preserving client privacy.  This is achieved by obfuscating IP addresses using dynamically generated names resolvable through Multicast DNS [RFC6763].</t></abstract>
