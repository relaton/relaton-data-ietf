<abstract><t>Unlike the existing active and passive OAM techniques, the emerging on-path flow telemetry techniques provide unmatched visibility into user traffic, showing great application potential not only for today's network OAM but also for future's automatic network operation.  Summarizing the current industry practices that addresses the deployment challenges and application requirements, we provide a closed-loop framework, named In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (iFIT), for efficiently applying a family of underlying on-path flow telemetry techniques in various network environments.  The framework enumerates several key architectural components and describes how these components are assembled together to achieve a complete and closed-loop working solution for on-path flow telemetry.  Following such a framework allows better scalability, fosters application innovations, and promotes both vertical and horizontal interoperability.</t></abstract>
