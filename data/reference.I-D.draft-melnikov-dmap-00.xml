<abstract><t>The DMAP Message Access Protocol, Version 1 allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server, without revealing too much information about messages being accessed to the server.  DMAP permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders. DMAP also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server and for message submission.  DMAP supports discovery of keys (signets) belonging to other users the client can communicate to.  Syncronization and publication of keys (private key, might include certificates) and signets (public part, certificate).  DMAP includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 5322 and RFC 2045 parsing, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.  Messages in DMAP are accessed by the use of numbers.  These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.  Note: This document is a very early draft and omission of specific syntax is intentional.  It is intended to stimulate discussions about specific protocol syntax and general design.</t></abstract>
