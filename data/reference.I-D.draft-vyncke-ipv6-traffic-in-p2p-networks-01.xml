<abstract><t>This document is a follow-up of a University thesis which aims to measure the evolution over time of IPv6 traffic and to analyze the geographical distribution of IPv6 nodes.  The first measurements were done during the Summer 2009 using a specific-purpose program which connects to the BitTorrent peer-to-peer network and this document adds measurements done with the same program but in October 2011 and February 2012.  The study was made in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks because they are responsible for a big part of Internet traffic and because their structure and functioning permit a rapid discovery of a large number of nodes from all over the world.  In addition, the P2P users are more likely to be interested by IPv6 as IPv6 does not have the same NAT problems as IPv4.</t></abstract>
