<abstract><t>We are approaching the time when we will be able to communicate faster than the speed of light.  It is well known that as we approach the speed of light, time slows down.  Logically, it is reasonable to assume that as we go faster than the speed of light, time will reverse.  The major consequence of this for Internet protocols is that packets will arrive before they are sent.  This will have a major impact on the way we design Internet protocols.  This paper outlines some of the issues and suggests some directions for additional analysis of these issues.</t></abstract>
