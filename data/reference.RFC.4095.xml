<abstract><t>This document proposes a mechanism for finding a URI associated with a solicitation class keyword, which is defined in RFC 3865, the No Soliciting SMTP Service Extension.  Solicitation class keywords are simple labels consisting of a domain name that has been reversed, such as &quot;org.example.adv&quot;.  These solicitation class keywords are inserted in selected header fields or used in the ESMTP service extension, including a new \%&quot;No-Solicit:&quot; header, which can contain one or more solicitation class keywords inserted by the sender.</t><t>This document specifies an application based on the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) described in RFC 3401 and related documents. An algorithm is specified to associate a solicitation class keyword with a URI which contains further information about the meaning and usage of that solicitation class keyword.  For example, the registrant of the &quot;example.org&quot; domain could use this mechanism to create a URI which contains detailed information about the &quot;org.example.adv&quot; solicitation class keyword.
