<abstract><t>The looming completion of IPv4 address allocations from IANA and the RIRs is already causing ISPs around the world to start to question how they will continue providing IPv4 service to IPv4-speaking customers when there are no longer sufficient IPv4 addresses to allocate them one per customer.  Several possible solutions to this problem are now emerging and this memo identifies important criteria to be borne in mind when evaluating these solutions.  We also seek to identify serious issues that remain even when mechanisms meeting our criteria are adopted.  We wish to stress that these solutions have a number of common, and potentially serious, issues.</t></abstract>
