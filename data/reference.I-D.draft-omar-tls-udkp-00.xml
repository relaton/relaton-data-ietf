<abstract><t>In this document I am providing the outlines for a modified version of the Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLS); the modified version will come as a new protocol that will build a secured tunnel between the client and the server without the need to involve Certificate Authorities or any other third party in this process; it is called User Defined Key Pair protocol(UDKP), and is based on the assumption that in most cases there is a registered profile for the user on the server; a profile that includes among a lot of things the username and the password that the user uses to authenticate to the server, the proposed protocol will make use of the username and the password to create a key pair for the user on the fly at the client side, and it will use this key pair as the starting point for creating the secured tunnel instead of taking the server certificate as the starting point. Additionally the proposed protocol has self- protection against phishing attacks.</t></abstract>
