<abstract><t>The HTML format for RFCs, described in [I-D.hildebrand-html-rfc] assigns style guidance to an RFC Editor-defined Cascading Style Sheet (CSS).  The embedded, default CSS as included by the RFC Editor is expected to take into account accessibility needs and be built along a responsive design model.  This document describes the requirements for the default CSS used by the RFC Editor.  The class names are based on the classes defined in draft-hildebrand-html-rfc.  Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.</t></abstract>
