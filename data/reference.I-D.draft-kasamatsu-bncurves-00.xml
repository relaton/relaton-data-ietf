<abstract><t>Elliptic curves with pairing are useful tools for constructing cryptographic primitives.  In this memo, we specify domain parameters of Barreto-Naehrig curve (BN-curve) [5].  The BN-curve is an elliptic curve suitable for pairings and allows us to achieve high security and efficiency of cryptographic schemes.  This memo specifies domain parameters of two 254-bit BN-curves [1] [2] which allow us to obtain efficient implementations and domain parameters of 224, 256, 384, and 512-bit BN-curves which are compliant with ISO/IEC 15946-5[3]. Furthermore, this memo organizes differences between types of elliptic curves specified in ISO document and often used in open source softwares, which are called M-type and D-type respectively[21].</t></abstract>
