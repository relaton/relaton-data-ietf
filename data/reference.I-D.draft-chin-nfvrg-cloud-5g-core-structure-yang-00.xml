<abstract><t>In 5G core network, all network functions are componentized, virtualized and grouped into VNF. Network management system will manage the functions based on VNF. This document presents YANG model proposal on overall structure of cloud native 5G core network. The structure is itself represented as an example YANG model, with all of the related component models logically organized in a way that is operationally intuitive, but this model is not expected to be implemented.  The identified component modules are expected to be defined and implemented.</t></abstract>
