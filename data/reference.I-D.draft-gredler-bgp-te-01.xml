<abstract><t>This document defines a new Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used to distribute a network topologies' link and node information.  Links can be either physical links connecting physical nodes, or virtual paths between physical or abstract nodes.  The network topology information is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol algorithms, operational experience, and administrative processes, such as inter-provider peering agreements.  The BGP protocol carrying Link State information would provide a well-defined, uniform, policy-controlled interface from the network to outside servers that need to learn the network topology in real- time, for example an ALTO Server or a Path Computation Server. Having Traffic Engineering (TE) information from remote areas and/or Autonomous Systems would allow path computation for inter-area and/or inter-AS source-routed unicast and multicast tunnels.</t></abstract>
