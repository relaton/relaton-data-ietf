<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism for signaling the active and standby status of redundant pseudowires (PWs) between their termination points. A set of redundant PWs is configured between provider edge (PE) nodes in single-segment pseudowire (SS-PW) applications, or between terminating provider edge (T-PE) nodes in multi-segment pseudowire (MS-PW) applications.  In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding PW packets to one another, a new status bit is defined. This bit indicates a preferential forwarding status with a value of Active or Standby for each PW in a redundant set.  In addition, a second status bit is defined to allow peer PE nodes to coordinate a switchover operation of the PW.  Finally, this document updates RFC 4447 by adding details to the handling of the PW Status Code bits in the PW Status TLV.</t></abstract>
