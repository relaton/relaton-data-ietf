<abstract><t>This draft discusses issues related to the application of peer to peer (P2P) technologies to SIP in particular, and Internet communications in general. After an analysis of the P2P and non-P2P capabilities of SIP, this draft proposes that a P2P protocol be standardized in the IETF as a protocol used between a Registrar/ Proxy/Redirect server and a Location Service.

After an analysis of the P2P and non-P2P capabilities of SIP, this draft proposes that a P2P protocol be standardized in the IETF as a protocol used between a Registrar/ Proxy/Redirect server and a Location Service. This allows the operator of a Registrar to decide how much registration state is be stored locally and how much can be distributed using the P2P network to a distributed Location Server. A number of DHT (Distributed Hash Table) P2P protocols that solve some similar functions are given as examples and could be used as input to this work. Finally, existing SIP and P2P work is surveyed with respect to this proposal.</t></abstract>
