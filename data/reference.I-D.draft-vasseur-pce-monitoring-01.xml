<abstract><t>A Path Computation Element (PCE) based architecture has been specified for the computation of Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks in the context of single or multiple domains (where a domain is referred to as a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems). In such PCE-based environment it is thus critical to monitor the state of the path computation chain and potentially gather various performance metrics with regards to the set of involved PCE(s) that can be used for performance monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. This document specifies procedures and extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order to gather such information.</t></abstract>
