<abstract><t>In this specification OSPF shortest path first computation is done based on power ratios (consumed-power to available-bandwidth OR available-bandwidth to available-bandwidth) assigned to links and nodes such as Broadcast-Multi-Access networks that form part of the topology in an area. When MPLS is deployed in the area (be it the backbone or non-backbone area) LDP can be used to distribute a disjoint set of labels for the power based topology. Flows some or all of those that traverse the area can then be mapped either to the regular shortest-path tree or the power based shortest-path tree. This document specifies the proposal to construct and maintain such a tree called the power based SPT.</t></abstract>
