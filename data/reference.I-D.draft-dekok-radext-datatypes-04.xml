<abstract><t>RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades, without rigorously defining them as managed entities.  During this time, RADIUS implementations have named the data types, and have used them as managed entities in attribute definitions.  This document updates the specifications to match established practice.  We do this by naming data types defined in RFC 6158, which have been used since at least RFC 2865.  We provide an IANA registry for the data types, and update the RADIUS Attribute Type registry to include a "data type" field for each attribute.  Finally, we recommend that authors of RADIUS specifications use these types in preference to existing practice.</t></abstract>
