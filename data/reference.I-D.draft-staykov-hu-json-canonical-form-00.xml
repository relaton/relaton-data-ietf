<abstract><t>A single JSON document can have multiple logically equivalent physical representations. While convenient for human interaction, this flexibility is inconvenient for cases where a machine is used to assess the logical equivalence of documents. In cases where logical equivalence is useful, an encoder should produce a canonical form of a JSON document. For example, since digital signatures demand the same physical representation for logically equivalent documents, a canonical physical representation would allow the signature to apply to the logical document. This internet draft has the goal to define a canonical form of JSON documents. Two logically equivalent documents should have same canonical form.</t></abstract>
