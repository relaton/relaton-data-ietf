<abstract><t>LDP is widely deployed in MPLS networks to signal LSPs. Since LDP establishes LSPs along IGP routed paths, its failure recovery is gated by IGP's re-convergence. Mechanisms such as IPFRR and RSVP-TE based FRR have been used to provide faster re-route for LDP LSPs. However these techniques have significant complexity and/or may not have full coverage. In this document we describe a method to perform fast re-route of LDP LSPs. The goal is to have recovery characteristics similar to the methods in [RSVP-TE-FRR] without depending on additional protocols but at the same time provide full coverage.</t></abstract>
