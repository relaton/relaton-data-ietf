<abstract><t>This memo presents a technique for a NETCONF server to initiate a SSH connection to a NETCONF client.  This is accomplished by the NETCONF client listening on IANA-assigned TCP port YYYY and starting the SSH client protocol immediately after accepting a TCP connection on it. This role-reversal is necessary as the NETCONF server must also be the SSH Server, in order for the NETCONF client to open the IANA- assigned SSH subsystem "netconf".</t></abstract>
