<abstract><t>HIP proxies play an important role in the transition from the current Internet architecture to the HIP architecture. The major function of HIP proxies is to make up legacy (or Non-HIP) hosts as HIP hosts and enable them to communicate with HIP hosts without upgrading their protocol stacks. In this document, the legacy hosts served by proxies is referred to as the Made-up Legacy (ML) hosts. Currently, various design solutions of HIP proxies have been proposed for different working circumstances, and the effectiveness of these solutions can be influenced by various factors (e.g., the information of HIP hosts maintained in DNS servers, the position where a proxy is located, etc.). In this document, we attempt to investigate these solutions in detail and compare their performance in different scenarios.</t></abstract>
