<abstract><t>This document defines two strategies for handling long lines in width-bounded text content.  One strategy is based on the historic use of a single backslash ('\') character to indicate where line- folding has occurred, with the continuation occurring with the first non-space (' ') character on the next line.  The second strategy extends the first strategy by adding a second backslash character to identify where the continuation begins and thereby able to handle cases not supported by the first strategy.  Both strategies use a self-describing header enabling automated reconstitution of the original content.</t></abstract>
