<abstract><t>NAT (Network Address Translator) Traversal may require TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) functionality in certain cases that are not unlikely to occur.  There is little incentive to deploy TURN servers, except by those who need them -- who may not be in a position to deploy a new protocol on an Internet-connected node, in particular not one with deployment requirements as high as those of TURN.  "STUN/TURN using PHP in Despair" is a highly deployable protocol for obtaining TURN-like functionality, while also providing the most important function of STUN.</t></abstract>
