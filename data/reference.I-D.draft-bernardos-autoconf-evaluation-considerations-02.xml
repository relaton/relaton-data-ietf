<abstract><t>This Internet Draft aims at providing general guidelines for the AUTOCONF solution space, through providing a set of evaluation considerations for IP autoconfiguration mechanisms in MANETs.  These evaluation considerations conform to the AUTOCONF problem statement draft and the MANET architecture draft.  The main objective of this draft is to illustrate some key features and highlight some important behaviours for the different autoconf mechanisms, and thus aiming to help solution developers during mechanisms' design and to help implementers in the choice of the autoconf mechanism that fits better their particular requirements, taking into consideration a number of important factors that are discussed in this draft.</t></abstract>
