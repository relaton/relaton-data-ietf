<abstract><t>This document describes and defines shim6 as a mobility solution for name-based sockets.  Using names rather than pseudo IP addresses, shim6 can handle a more diverse set of mobility scenarios.  These changes allow a shim6 session to persist even through cases where one node has no working locators to its correspondent node.  If the name is also a resolvable fully qualified domain name, the connection can be kept alive even if neither node have a working locator to the corresponding node.  As can be the case if both nodes are mobile simultaneously.</t></abstract>
