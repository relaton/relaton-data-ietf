<abstract><t>This document defines two new Traffic Selector (TS) Types for Internet Key Exchange version 2 to add support for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) security labels, also known as "Labeled IPsec".  The two new TS Types are TS_IPV4_ADDR_RANGE_SECLABEL and TS_IPV6_ADDR_RANGE_SECLABEL, which are identical to their non- seclabel namesakes except for the addition of a variable length opaque field specifying the security label.  These new Traffic Selector Types facilitate negotiating security labels as an additional selector of the Security Policy Database to further restrict the type of traffic allowed to be send and received over the IPsec SA.</t></abstract>
