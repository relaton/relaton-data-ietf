<abstract><t>Proxy mobile ipv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to manage mobility of hosts that are not equipped with any mobility management protocol. But PMIPv6 has a handover latency because it is based on global mobility management protocols such as MIPv6. Handover latency sensitives impact on real-time application. This document describes Fast and Local Proxy Mobile IPv6 (FLPMIPv6) to reduce handover latency and packet loss ratio. The scheme is based on the fast mobile IP scheme and utilized some of messages defined in 802.21 and information coming from link layer.</t></abstract>
