<abstract><t>This draft proposes an estimation scheme of available capacity for network mobility (NEMO) with the multi-interfaced mobile router (MMR). In the proposed scheme, mobile nodes (MNs) can get information on available capacity irrespective of the presence or absence of estimation functionality. Since the MMR with heterogeneous wireless network interfaces estimates available capacity on behalf of the MNs inside the mobile network, the proposed scheme does not require MNs to be involved in estimating available capacity. A new algorithm for available capacity estimation on MMR is developed to improve the estimation accuracy compared with the existing scheme. The developed algorithm defines three cases of the difference between the average output gap and the input gap, and then reflects fully them, which can reduce the detection error for the turning point and thus provide more accurate estimation than the existing algorithm. Then, MNs can get information on estimated available capacity from the MMR using L3 messages. Therefore, the proposed scheme can reduce burden and power consumption of MNs with limited resource and battery power since MNs do not estimates directly available capacity. In addition, the proposed scheme can reduce considerably traffic overhead over wireless links on multiple estimation paths since signaling messages and injected testing traffic are reduced.</t></abstract>
