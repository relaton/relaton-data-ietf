<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 [1] is an IP layer mobility protocol which allows mobile nodes to remain reachable while moving around on the Internet. With the existing specification, a mobile node's movement can be tracked by simply monitoring the IP addresses in communication involving the mobile node. In this document, we propose techniques for hiding a mobile node's location information from eavesdroppers as well as from correspondent nodes. The proposed techniques are efficient and fully compatible with the base Mobile IPv6 operation.</t></abstract>
