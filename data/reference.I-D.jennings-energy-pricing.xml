<abstract><t>This specification defines media types for representing the future price of energy in JSON.  It also defines a way for a client device, such as a car, refrigerator, air conditioner, water heater, or display to discover a web server that can provide the future price for local electrical energy.  This will allow the client device to make intelligent decisions about when to use energy, and enable price distribution when the building is off-grid.  It enables obtaining price from a local or non-local price server.  This draft is an early skeleton of a draft to start discussion around this idea.</t></abstract>
