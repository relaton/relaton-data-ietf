<abstract><t>Fast re-route (FRR) is a technique that allows productive forwarding to continue in a network after a failure has occurred, but before the network has has time to re-converge.  This is achieved by forwarding a packet on an alternate path that will not result in the packet looping.  Preferred Path Routing (PPR) provides a method of injecting explicit paths into the routing protocol.  The use of PPR to support FRR has a number of advantages.  This document describes the advantages of using PPR to provide a loop-free alternate FRR path, and provides a framework for its use in this application.</t></abstract>
