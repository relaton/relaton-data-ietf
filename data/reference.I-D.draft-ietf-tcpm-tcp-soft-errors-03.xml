<abstract><t>This document discusses the problem of long delays between connection establishment attempts that may arise in a number of scenarios, including one in which dual stack nodes that have IPv6 enabled by default are deployed in IPv4 or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments. Additionally, this document describes a non-standard, but widely implemented modification to TCP's reaction to ICMP "soft errors" that can help overcome this problem.</t></abstract>
