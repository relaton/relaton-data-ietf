<abstract><t>To reliably hand over data packets to the destination in Delay  Tolerant Networks (DTNs), many dissemination-based routing protocols  are proposed. Dissemination-based routing protocols assure nodes  including intermediate nodes and destinations have more chances to  receive packets, which will increase the probability that the packets  can be correctly received by the destination. However, the existing  error recovery mechanisms in network layer use the simple CRC to  check the data packets independently, and discard the error packets  even if one correct packet can be obtained from more than one partly  error packets. This document describes Dissemination-based Routing  Protocol with Network-layer Error Control (NER-DRP). NER-DRP divides  a data packet into RS blocks and inserts redundancy to each block. So  the intermediate nodes and destinations can recover a correct data  packet from multiple partially error copies of the same packet.</t></abstract>
