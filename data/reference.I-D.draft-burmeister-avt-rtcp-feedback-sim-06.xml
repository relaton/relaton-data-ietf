<abstract><t>This document describes the results we achieved when simulating the timing rules of the Extended RTP Profile for RTCP-based Feedback, denoted AVPF. Unicast and multicast topologies are considered as well as several protocol and environment configurations. The results show that the timing rules result in better performance regarding feedback delay and still preserve the well accepted RTP rules regarding allowed bit rates for control traffic.</t></abstract>
