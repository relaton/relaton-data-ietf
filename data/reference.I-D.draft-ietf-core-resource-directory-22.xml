<abstract><t>In many IoT applications, direct discovery of resources is not practical due to sleeping nodes, disperse networks, or networks where multicast traffic is inefficient.  These problems can be solved by employing an entity called a Resource Directory (RD), which contains information about resources held on other servers, allowing lookups to be performed for those resources.  The input to an RD is composed of links and the output is composed of links constructed from the information stored in the RD.  This document specifies the web interfaces that a Resource Directory supports for web servers to discover the RD and to register, maintain, lookup and remove information on resources.  Furthermore, new target attributes useful in conjunction with an RD are defined.</t></abstract>
