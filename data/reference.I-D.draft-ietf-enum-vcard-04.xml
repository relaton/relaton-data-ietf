<abstract><t>This memo registers the Enumservice "vCard" with the subtypes "plain", "xml" and "rdf" using the URI schemes "http" and "https" according to the IANA Enumservice registration process described in RFC 3761. This Enumservice is to be used to refer from an ENUM domain name to a vCard instance describing the user of the respective E.164 number. Information gathered from those vCards could be used before, during or after inbound or outbound communication takes place. For example, a callee might be presented with the name and association of the caller before picking up the call.</t></abstract>
