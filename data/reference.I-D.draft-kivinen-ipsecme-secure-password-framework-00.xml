<abstract><t>The IPsecME working group was chartered to provide IKEv2 a symmetric secure password authentication protocol that supports using of low- entropy shared secrets, but which is protected against off-line dictionary attacks without requiring the use of certificates of EAP. There are multiple of such methods and working group was supposed to pick one.  Unfortunately the working group failed to get pick one protocol and there are multiple candidates going forward as separate documents.  As each of those documents uses different method to negotiate the use of the method and also uses different payload formats it is very hard to try to make implementation where multiple of those systems could co-exists.  This document tries to create generic way for those methods to negotiate which one is used and provides one new payload which can be used to transmit method specific data.</t></abstract>
