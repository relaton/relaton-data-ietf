<abstract><t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) provides information to support admission control and flow termination in order to protect the Quality of Service of inelastic flows.  It does this by marking packets when traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded a threshold below the physical link rate.  This document specifies how such marks are to be encoded into the IP header.  The baseline encoding described here provides for only two PCN encoding states. It is designed to be easily extensible to provide more encoding states but such schemes will be described in other documents.</t></abstract>
