<abstract><t>There is a growing demand for routable IP addresses to support large wireless user base today. Wireless operators are looking for ways to leverage the IPv6 address space to meet the ever increasing number of wireless data users. The operators who have network based IPv4 mobility solutions can leverage the same scheme to provide mobility access service with larger address pool using IPv6 addressing. The proposed approach solves both, by allowing the provision of the mobility service, and the IPv6 address acquisition for the MN, either by the Access Router, or by the virtual link-layer through the Access Node.</t></abstract>
