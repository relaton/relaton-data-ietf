<abstract><t>This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid' namespace identifier.  The main purpose of the standard is to support specification of references that are not covered by other reference techniques: to support references to material in web archives with restricted access.  Furthermore, it supports persistent technology agnostic references to web archives in general, in a form that can work as an algorithmic basis for finding web archive resources in general.  An additional important benefit is that it can be used in specifying web collections, which then can form a persistent computational basis for the extract of the archived collection parts.  Since the parts can be specified generally, this further allow collections to be specified with elements from one or more web archives.  The PWID is designed for researchers and therefore it is designed as general, global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic, persistent and precise web references for web materials in web archives.</t></abstract>
