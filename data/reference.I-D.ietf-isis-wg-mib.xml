<abstract><t>This document describes a management information base for the IS-IS Routing protocol when it is used to construct routing tables for IP networks. This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. This memo is based on an IETF draft by Chris Gunner. This version has been modified to include MIB-II syntax, to exclude portions of the protocol that are not relevant to IP, such as the ES-IS protocol, and to add management support for current practice.</t></abstract>
