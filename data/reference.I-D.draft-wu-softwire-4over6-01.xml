<abstract><t>Due to the rapid deployment of IPv6 networks, especially IPv6 backbones, the existing long-live IPv4 networks are going to be connected to these IPv6 networks. In the environment that ISP hopes to use IPv6 backbones while still provides end users IPv4 access to support existing IPv4 applications, IPv4 traffic needs to be transported over IPv6 backbones. Along with the growth of IPv6 backbones, the number of IPv4 access networks increases and the IPv4/v6 interconnection topology becomes complex. Therefore, the existing manual configuration mechanism for a large number of end-2- end tunnels will cause an insufferable burden. This draft addresses this problem and presents a mechanism of automatic 4over6 tunnel-end discovery with BGP extensions.</t></abstract>
