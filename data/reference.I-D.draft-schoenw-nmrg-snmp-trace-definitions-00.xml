<abstract><t>The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) started an activity to collect traces of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) from operational networks.  To analyze these traces, it is necessary to split potentially large traces into more manageable pieces that make it easier to deal with large data sets and simplify the analysis of the data.  This document provides some common definitions that have been found useful for implementing tools to support trace analysis.  This document mainly serves as a reference for the definitions underlying these tools and it is not meant to explain all the motivation and reasoning behind the definitions.  Some of this background information can be found in other research papers.</t></abstract>
