<abstract><t>Kerberos is a protocol for verifying the identity of principals (e.g., a workstation user or a network server) on an open network. The Kerberos protocol provides a facility called pre-authentication. Pre-authentication mechanisms can use this facility to extend the Kerberos protocol and prove the identity of a principal.  This document describes a more formal model for this facility.  The model describes what state in the Kerberos request a pre- authentication mechanism is likely to change.  It also describes how multiple pre-authentication mechanisms used in the same request will interact.  This document also provides common tools needed by multiple pre- authentication mechanisms.  One of these tools is a secure channel between the client and the key distribution center with a reply key strengthening mechanism; this secure channel can be used to protect the authentication exchange thus eliminate offline dictionary attacks.  With these tools, it is relatively straightforward to chain multiple authentication mechanisms, utilize a different key management system, or support a new key agreement algorithm.</t></abstract>
