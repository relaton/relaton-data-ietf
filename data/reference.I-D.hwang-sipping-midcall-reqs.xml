<abstract><t>In its current form, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows session invitations, instant messages, and other requests to be delivered from one party to another. However it doesnot explicitly permit midcall events such as hook/flash from the user to be passed on to the network application server. Without such ability, it is not clear how SIP can be used to provide certain network controlled services. This document identifies a set of requirements for extensions to SIP to provide a MidCall-based communications framework.</t></abstract>
