<abstract><t>BroadVoice(R) [bv-website] is a family of two open-source speech codecs suitable for Voice over IP (VoIP) applications.  It is designed to achieve high speech quality with relatively low complexity and a very low coding delay.  BroadVoice consists of two variants: a 16 kb/s narrowband codec for 8 kHz sampling called BroadVoice16, or BV16, and a 32 kb/s wideband codec for 16 kHz sampling called BroadVoice32, or BV32.  BV16 and BV32 are standard codecs of PacketCable(TM), SCTE(R), and ANSI for VoIP applications in cable telephony, and they are also listed as optional codecs in the ITU-T Recommendations J.161 and J.361, respectively.  This document describes the BV16 and BV32 speech codecs.</t></abstract>
