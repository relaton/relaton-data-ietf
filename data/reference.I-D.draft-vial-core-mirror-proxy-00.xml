<abstract><t>This document introduces the concept of Mirror Proxy that enables sleeping devices to participate in a REST architecture despite the fact that they are not web servers.  Most constrained devices may sleep during long periods preventing them from acting as traditional web servers.  However as client-only endpoints they can rely on a Mirror Proxy to cache and serve the content they provide.</t></abstract>
