<abstract><t>IP fragmentation has long been subject for scrutiny since the publication of "Fragmentation Considered Harmful" in 1987.  This work cast fragmentation in a negative light that has persisted to the present day.  However, the tone of the work failed to honor two principles of creative thinking: never say "always" and never say "never".  This document discusses uses for fragmentation that apply both to the present day and moving forward into the future.</t></abstract>
