<abstract><t>This memo specifies the requirements and mechanism for a SIP events extension where bulk SIP event information can be shared between two peers both with the ability and authority to act as notifiers for this information.  An example application use case is the transition of event state information during a backup/recovery sequence between event state servers.  This document is targeted at addressing server overflow conditions that include the possibilities of the size of individual notification messages getting excessive and the processing of state information by both the subscriber and notifier also becoming excessive.</t></abstract>
