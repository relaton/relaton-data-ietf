<abstract><t>This document describes the outcome of the discussions on the necessary OAM functionality for the first release of MPLS based transport networks.  The discussion is based on the set of requirements for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) for MPLS based transport networks as defined in [MPLS-TP OAM Reqs]. An important aspect was to evaluate whether existing OAM tools from the current MPLS protocol suite can be used to fulfill these requirements.  Eventually, the purpose of the document is to map the set of functions to a set of tools based on the existing OAM tool- set.</t></abstract>
