<abstract><t>This document discusses a flaw in some of the currently distributed name resolver clients.  The flaw exposes a security weakness related to the search heuristic invoked by these same resolvers when users provide a partial domain name, and which is easy to exploit.  This document points out the flaw, a case in point, and a solution. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.</t></abstract>
