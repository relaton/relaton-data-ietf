<abstract><t>The IETF IPPM working group has defined a metric for packet loss. The packet loss metric quantifies the case where a packet that is sent, never arrives at its destination. However, the opposite is also possible: a packet is sent and arrives more than once. This document defines a metric to quantify these kinds of events.</t></abstract>
