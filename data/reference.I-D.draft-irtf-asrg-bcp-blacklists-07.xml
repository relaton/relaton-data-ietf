<abstract><t>The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has led to the creation of shared DNS-based lists ("DNSBLs") of IP addresses or domain names intended to help guide email filtering. This memo summarizes guidelines of accepted best practice for the management of public DNSBLs by their operators as well as for the proper use of such lists by mail server administrators (DNSBL users), and it provides useful background for both parties.  It is not intended to advise on the utility or efficacy of particular DNSBLs or the DNSBL concept in general, nor to assist end users with questions about spam.  Comments and discussion of this document should be addressed to the asrg@ietf.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
