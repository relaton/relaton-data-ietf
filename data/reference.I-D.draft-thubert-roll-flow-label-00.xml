<abstract><t>In a Low Power Lossy Network, the traditional tuple of source, destination and ports might not be the proper indication to isolate a meaningful flow.  For instance, it can be a requirement for the aggregation of related measurements from multiple sources to be treated as a single flow following a same path in order to experience similar jitter and latency.  In that case, the Flow Label in packets outgoing a RPL domain could and sometimes should be set by the root of the RPL structure.  It derives that the Flow Label could be reused inside the RPL domain.  This document present how the Flow Label can be used inside a LLN as a replacement to the RPL option and provides rules for the root to set and reset the Flow Label when forwarding between the inside of RPL domain and the larger Internet, in both direction.</t></abstract>
