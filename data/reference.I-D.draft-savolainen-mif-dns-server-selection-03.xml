<abstract><t>A multi-homed host may receive DNS server configuration information from multiple physical and/or virtual network interfaces.  In split DNS scenarios some DNS servers have information others do not have. When the multi-homed host needs to utilize DNS, it has to select which of the servers to contact to.  This document describes a policy based method for selecting DNS server for both forward and reverse DNS lookup procedures with help of DNS suffix and IPv6 prefix information received via DHCPv6.</t></abstract>
