<abstract><t>This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and managing forwarding instances on a network device - focused primarily on deployments in service provider networks.  The model is vendor- neutral and based on operational requirements expressed by operators. A 'network instance' is defined to be a discrete forwarding table on a network element, which contains Layer 3 and/or Layer 2 forwarding entries.  Each network instance may instantiate its own sets of protocols which control installation of forwarding entries into one or more tables (which may be Layer 2 FIBs, or Layer 3 RIBs).</t></abstract>
