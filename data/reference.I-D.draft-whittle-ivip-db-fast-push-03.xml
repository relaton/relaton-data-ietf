<abstract><t>From the base of draft-whittle-ivip-arch-03 and later, this ID describes Ivip's fast-push mapping distribution system.  This accepts mapping changes from end-user networks or organizations they authorise to make these changes.  The mapping changes are handled by RUAS (Root Update Authorization Server) companies who collectively run the initial levels of a global network of Replicator servers. This is a secure, packet-based flooding system which will propagate the mapping changes to potentially hundreds of thousands of full database query servers (QSDs) in ISPs and larger end-user networks all over the world.  This ID describes the overall system.  The distributed Fast Payload Forwarding system is described in detail in draft-whittle-ivip-fpr.</t></abstract>
