<abstract><t>This document presents application specific requirements for Routing in Low power and Loosy Networks (RL2N). The scope of this document is home control and home automation. In a modern home, a high number of wireless devices are used for a wide set of purposes. Examples include lighting control modules, heating control panels, light sensors, temperature sensors, gas/water leak detector, motion detectors, video surveillance, healthcare systems and advanced remote controls. Because such devices only cover a limited radio range, multi-hop routing is often required. Such devices are usually highly constrained in terms of resources such as battery and memory and operate in unstable environments. The aim of this document is to specify the routing requirements for networks comprising such constrained devices in a home network environment.</t></abstract>
