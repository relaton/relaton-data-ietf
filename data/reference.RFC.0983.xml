<abstract><t>This memo describes a proposed protocol standard for the ARPA Internet    community.  The CCITT and the ISO have defined various session,    presentation, and application recommendations which have been adopted by    the international community and numerous vendors.  To the largest extent    possible, it is desirable to offer these higher level services directly    in the ARPA Internet, without disrupting existing facilities.  This    permits users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications which    previously were not available in the ARPA Internet.  The intention is    that hosts in the ARPA-Internet that choose to implement ISO TSAP    services on top of the TCP be expected to adopt and implement this    standard.  Suggestions for improvement are encouraged.</t></abstract>
