<abstract><t>This document describes a new message, its associated acknowledgement message, and a new parameter to extend the ISDN Q.921-User Adaptation (IUA) protocol (RFC4233).  The protocol extension is to support the use of an Overload Control Agent in a Signaling Gateway (SG).  The Overload Control Agent is able to restrict the admission of new originating ISDN calls (sessions) messages from the ISDN End Point to each Application Server Process (ASP).  Both messages defined here contain a single mandatory parameter, the Call (Session) Admission Rate.  An ASP is able to use this protocol extension to control the rate of new calls admitted towards that ASP by the Overload Control Agent.  The new message and its acknowledgement message are added to the Application Server Process Traffic Maintenance (ASPTM) message class.  As the DPNSS1/DASS2 Extension to IUA (DUA, RFC4129) also uses the ASPTM message class, the IUA protocol extension described in this document also applies to DUA.  For backward compatibility, a Signaling Gateway which does not support the new message is expected to follow standard IUA behaviour by discarding the message, and returning an error code of "Unsupported Message Type" to the sender.</t></abstract>
