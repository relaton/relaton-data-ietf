<abstract><t>This memo considers the need to authenticate the source of a network communication where the actual identity of the source is not important but it is important and that successive messages in the communication come from the same source. This memo defines the use of specially generated public/private key pairs, known as Purpose- Built Keys (PBKs), to provide this assurance. This memo is not a full specification of a PBK protocol, but rather a model or framework for development of PBK in applications</t></abstract>
