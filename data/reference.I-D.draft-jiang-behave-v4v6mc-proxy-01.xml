<abstract><t>During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the interoperation between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential. Multicast services across IPv6 and IPv4 networks are also needed. Besides the packet-based multicast translation mechanism, this document describes a multicast proxy solution. The multicast proxy is deployed at the border of IPv6/IPv4 networks. It is mainly based on content cache concept. Without packet-based translation, it retires the content data from IPvX network, caches the data, and multicasts the data in IPvY network. It acts as a multicast leaf in the IPvX network where the data source locates. It also acts as a multicast source in IPvY network where the multicast client locates.</t></abstract>
