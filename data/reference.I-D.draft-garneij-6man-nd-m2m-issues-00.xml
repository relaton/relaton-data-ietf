<abstract><t>The use of IPv6 in 3GPP cellular broadband networks for accessing the Internet and other data services like voice-over-LTE(VoLTE) has increased greatly as a result of EPS network deployments worldwide and new IPv6 capable smartphones and tablets.  The upcoming rise of IoT/M2M is anticipated to bring billions of new devices into these networks and the majority of these devices will be using only IPv6. This document discusses the EPS network impact of IoT/M2M IPv6 connectivity specifically targeting the IPv6 Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), as specified in [RFC4861] and [RFC4862], which currently is the only supported IPv6 address configuration mechanism in 3GPP standards.</t></abstract>
