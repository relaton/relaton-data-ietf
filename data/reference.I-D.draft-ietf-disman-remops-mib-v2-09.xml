<abstract><t>This memo defines Management Information Bases (MIBs) for performing ping, traceroute and lookup operations at a host. When managing a network it is useful to be able to initiate and retrieve the results of ping or traceroute operations when performed at a remote host. A Lookup capability is defined in order to enable resolution of either an IP address to an DNS name or a DNS name to an IP address at a remote host. Currently, there are several enterprise-specific MIBs for performing remote ping or traceroute operations. The purpose of this memo is to define a standards-based solution to enable interoperability.</t></abstract>
