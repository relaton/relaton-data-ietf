<abstract><t>This document describes the function and responsibilities of the RFC Independent Submission Editor (ISE).  The Independent Submission stream is one of the stream producers that create draft RFCs, with the ISE as its stream approver.  The ISE is overall responsible for activities within the Independent Submission stream, working with draft editors and reviewers, and interacts with the RFC Production Center and Publisher, and the RFC Series Editor (RSE).  The ISE is appointed by the IAB, and also interacts with the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (LLC).  This version obsoletes RFC 6548 to replace all references to the IASA and related structures with those defined by the IASA 2.0 Model.  [RFC Editor: Please remove the following paragraph prior to publication.]  The IASA2 WG requests that the IAB publish this replacement for RFC 6548.</t></abstract>
