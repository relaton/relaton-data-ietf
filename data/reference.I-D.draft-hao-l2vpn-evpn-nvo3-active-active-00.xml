<abstract><t>E-VPN can be used as a control plane protocol for NVO3 network. In All- Active access scenario, loop &amp; echo forwarding prevention among multi- homed NVEs relies on "Split horizon" filtering mechanism. ESI MPLS label is leveraged to perform split horizon filtering in MPLS based EVPN network. In VXLAN or NVGRE encapsulation based overlay network, no MPLS is used. Therefore a new method is introduced in this document to achieve split horizon filtering in non-MPLS overlay network. Data plane of the overlay network is extended with a LAGID field. The function of LAGID is similar to ESI MPLS Label in [EVPN]. It is used to identify each Ethernet segment(ES) on each NVE.</t></abstract>
