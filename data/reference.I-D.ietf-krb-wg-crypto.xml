<abstract><t>This document describes a framework for defining encryption and checksum mechanisms for use with the Kerberos protocol, defining an abstraction layer between the Kerberos protocol and related protocols, and the actual mechanisms themselves. Several mechanisms are also defined in this document. Some are taken from RFC 1510, modified in form to fit this new framework, and occasionally modified in content when the old specification was incorrect. New mechanisms are presented here as well. This document does NOT indicate which mechanisms may be considered 'required to implement'. Comments should be sent to the editor, or to the IETF Kerberos working group (ietf-krb-wg@anl.gov).</t></abstract>
