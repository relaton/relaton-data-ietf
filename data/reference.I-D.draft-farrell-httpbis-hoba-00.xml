<abstract><t>This memo proposes a way of using origin-bound certificates for HTTP authentication, called HOBA.  HOBA is an HTTP authentication method with credentials that are not vulnerable to simple phishing attacks, and that does not require a server-side password database, both major potential positives, if deployed.  HOBA can be integrated with account management and other applications running over HTTP and supports portability, so a user can associate more than one device or origin-bound certificate with the same service.  This also provides a mechanism to handle state-loss, if one of a user's credentials is lost.  HOBA also provides a logout mechanism.</t></abstract>
