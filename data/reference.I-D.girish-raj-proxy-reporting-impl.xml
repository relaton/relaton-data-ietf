<abstract><t>This document suggests a way for implementing a IGMP/MLD proxy- reporting switch in which reports received from downstream hosts and queries received from upstream routers are used to build the Subscription Aggregation table. Subscription Aggregation table can be used for forwarding multicast data traffic, sending state change and current state reports to upstream router ports.</t></abstract>
