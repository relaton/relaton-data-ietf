<abstract><t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to provide mobility service to mobile nodes in the network domain that does not require the nodes to be involved in mobility management.  In other words, the PMIPv6 can support roaming within a PMIPv6 domain, i.e. intra-domain roaming, transparent to mobile nodes without mobility functionality.  However, the mobile nodes should have additional protocols such as MIPv6 for roaming between PMIPv6 domains, i.e. inter-domain roaming, although the domains also service the transparent mobility.  Hence, network- based solution is needed for providing transparent mobility to the mobile nodes that only move about between PMIPv6 domains.  This document specifies the inter-domain roaming mechanism controlled by the networks adopting the PMIPv6 protocol.</t></abstract>
