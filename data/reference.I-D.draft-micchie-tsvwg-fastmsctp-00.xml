<abstract><t>Providing transport layer mobility is one of the features of SCTP [RFC2960]. By using Dynamic Address Reconfiguration extension, SCTP can accomplish handover between different subnets. However, due to some issues in the current SCTP, serious performance degradation will happen during the handover process. The problem arises especially when a mobile node has only one network interface. This document describes the issues of current SCTP handover mechanism and proposes three functions to achieve smooth and fast handover.</t></abstract>
