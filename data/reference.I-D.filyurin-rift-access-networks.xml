<abstract><t>RIFT is a new specialized dynamic routing protocol originally designed for Clos and Fat Tree Data Center networks.  It is designed to work on multilevel network topologies in which nodes in certain level will only connect to nodes in one upper or lower level with optional and non-contiguous intra-level connectivity.  While the protocol was originally designed to meet the needs of Massively Scalable Data Centers, its ability to automatically prune the information distribution from higher levels to lower levels, as well as provide optimal routing for intra and inter-level traffic makes it a good match for user access networks, or any network that combines end user access and various compute enabling various network service for these end users.  Current directions in distributed computing seek to blur even that distinction.  Large distributed networks can be created, where virtual compute units can be in all tiers, combining and crossing many requirements for DC or User Access design.  This draft seeks to analyze these requirements.</t></abstract>
