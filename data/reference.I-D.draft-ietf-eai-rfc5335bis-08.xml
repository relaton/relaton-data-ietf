<abstract><t>Internet mail was originally limited to 7-bit ASCII.  Recent enhancements support Unicode's UTF-8 encoding in portions of a message.  Full internationalization of electronic mail requires additional enhancement, including support for UTF-8 in user-oriented header fields, such as in the To, From, and Subject fields.  This document specifies an enhancement to Internet mail that permits native UTF-8 support in the header and body of a message.</t></abstract>
