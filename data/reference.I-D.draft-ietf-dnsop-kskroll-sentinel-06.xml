<abstract><t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain of trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.  This document specifies a mechanism that will allow an end user and third parties to determine the trusted key state for the root key of the resolvers that handle that user's DNS queries.  Note that this method is only applicable for determing which keys are in the trust store for the root key.  There is an example / toy implementation of this at http://www.ksk- test.net .  [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/APNIC-Labs/draft-kskroll-sentinel.  The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.  Text in square brackets will be removed before publication. ]  [ NOTE: This version uses the labels "kskroll-sentinel-is-ta-&lt;key- tag>", "kskroll-sentinel-not-ta-&lt;key-tag>"; older versions of this document used "_is-ta-&lt;key-tag>", "_not-ta-&lt;key-tag>".  Also note that the format of the tag-index is now zero-filled decimal. Apolgies to those who have began implmenting.]</t></abstract>
