<abstract><t>LTASP has been created to solve mid-range and below, long term archiving requirements of the small medium enterprise.  Where tape has been deployed in the past LTASP now offers an alternative solution designed to be more robust and manageable in the long term than network attached storage devices or simple disk storage alone. To maintain archives over a number of years requires a well organised and robust approach, this is the purpose of LTASP.  The storage unit of LTASP is the volume, which can be viewed as roughly equivalent to the contents of a single tape.</t></abstract>
