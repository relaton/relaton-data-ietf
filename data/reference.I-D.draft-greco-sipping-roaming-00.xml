<abstract><t>Roaming services allow users that have a contract with a voice service provider to use access resources owned by other providers known as internet access providers. This draft proposes a token- based Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) and billing model for roaming users. It also introduces a protocol solution for the proposed model that is based on the Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).</t></abstract>
