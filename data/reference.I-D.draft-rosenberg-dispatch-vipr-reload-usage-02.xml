<abstract><t>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for inter-domain SIP federation.  ViPR makes use of the RELOAD protocol to store unverified mappings from phone numbers to RELOAD nodes, with whom a validation process can be run.  This document defines the usage of RELOAD for this purpose.
