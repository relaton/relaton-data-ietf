<abstract><t>This memo defines a Media Delivery Index (MDI) measurement that can be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring a network intended to deliver applications such as streaming media, MPEG video, Voice over IP, or other information sensitive to arrival time and packet loss.  It provides an indication of traffic jitter, a measure of deviation from nominal flow rates, and a data loss at-a-glance measure for a particular flow.  For instance, the MDI may be used as a reference in characterizing and comparing networks carrying UDP streaming media.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
