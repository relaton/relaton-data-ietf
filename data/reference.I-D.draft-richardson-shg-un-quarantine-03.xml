<abstract><t>The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a tool to describe the limited access that a single function device such as an Internet of Things device might need.  The enforcement of the access control lists described protects the device from attacks from the Internet, and protects the Internets from compromised devices.  This document details a process which occurs when a device is detected to have violated the stated policy.  The goal of these steps is to ensure that the device is correctly removed from operation, fixed, and if possible, restored to safe operation.  This document does not define any new protocols, but provides context in which a number of existing protocols are to be used together.</t></abstract>
