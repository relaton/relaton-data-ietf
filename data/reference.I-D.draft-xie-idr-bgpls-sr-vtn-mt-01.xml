<abstract><t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) as defined in I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support applications's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.  VPN+ requries integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay network.  A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which consists of a subset of the network toplogy and network resources allocated from the underlay network.  A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services.  I-D.dong-idr-bgpls-sr-enhanced-vpn defines the BGP-LS extensions to distribute the information of Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs to external entities, such as the network controllers.  This document describes a simplified mechanism to distribute the information of SR based VTNs using BGP-LS with Multi-Topology.</t></abstract>
