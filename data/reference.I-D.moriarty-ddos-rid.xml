<abstract><t>Network security incidents such as Denial of Service (DoS), system compromises, worms, and viruses typically result in the loss of service, data, and resources both human and system. Security incidents can be detrimental to the health of the network as a whole. Network Providers (NP) need to be equipped and ready to assist in tracing security incidents with tools and procedures in place before the occurrence of an attack. This paper proposes a proactive inter-network communication method to integrate existing tracing mechanisms across NP boundaries to identify the source(s) of an attack. The various methods implemented to detect and trace attacks must be coordinated on the NPs network as well as provide a communication mechanism across network borders. It is imperative that NPs have quick communication methods defined to enable neighboring NPs to assist in tracking a security incident across the Internet. This proposal integrates current incident detection and tracing practices for network traffic, which could be extended for security incident handling. Policy guidelines for handling incidents are recommended and can be agreed upon by a consortium using the defined protocol and extended to each NP's clients.</t></abstract>
