<abstract><t>As communicated by WG Chairs, the IETF NVO3 chairs and Routing Area director have chartered a design team to take forward the encapsulation discussion and see if there is potential to design a common encapsulation that addresses the various technical concerns.  There are implications of different encapsulations in real environments consisting of both software and hardware implementations and spanning multiple data centers.  For example, OAM functions such as path MTU discovery become challenging with multiple encapsulations along the data path.  The design team recommend Geneve with few modifications as the common encapsulation, more details are described in section 7.</t></abstract>
