<abstract><t>Sometimes some SFs of a SFC are provided by several DC networks. That means a SFC may cross several SFs in different DC network.  How to establish such SFC that is across several DCs is what we want to state.  In this document, a hierarchical SFC method is proposed.  It will cover data plane, control plane for such hierarchical SFC.  And it includes requirements of the SFC Gateway for every DC network that provide SF for SFC.</t></abstract>
