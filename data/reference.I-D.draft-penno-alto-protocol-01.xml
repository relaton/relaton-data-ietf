<abstract><t>The ALTO Service enables an Internet Service Provider (ISP) to convey cost preferences to network applications in order to modify network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance.  Applications that could use this service are those that have a choice in connection endpoints.  Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.  Applications already have access to great amount of underlying topology information.  For example, views of the Internet routing table are easily available at looking glass servers and entirely practical to download to every client.  What is missing is the cost information -- what does an ISP or Content Provider actually prefer?  This document describes a very simple protocol that allows a ISP to convey such information to applications.  While such service would primarily be provided by the network (i.e., the local ISP).  Content Provider and third parties could also operate this service.</t></abstract>
