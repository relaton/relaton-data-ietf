<abstract><t>This document defines a new BGP NLRI encoding format that can be used to distribute traffic flow specifications.  This allows the routing system to propagate information regarding more-specific components of the traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination prefix.  Additionally it defines two applications of that encoding format. One that can be used to automate inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate (distributed) denial of service attacks.  And a second application to traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service.  The information is carried via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), thereby reusing protocol algorithms, operational experience and administrative processes such as inter-provider peering agreements.</t></abstract>
