<abstract><t>This document describes several Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal techniques that were considered to be used for establishing the RTP media flows controlled by the Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP).  Each technique includes a description on how it would be used, the security implications of using it and any other deployment considerations it has.  There are also discussions on how NAT traversal techniques relates to firewalls and how each technique can be applied in different use cases.  These findings where used when selecting the NAT traversal for RTSP 2.0.</t></abstract>
