<abstract><t>This document describes a method to join a group where communications are based on CoAP and secured with Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE).  The proposed method delegates the authentication and authorization of client nodes that join an OSCORE group through a Group Manager server.  This approach builds on the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization, and leverages protocol-specific profiles of ACE to achieve communication security, proof-of-possession and server authentication.</t></abstract>
