<abstract><t>Currently OSPFv3 uses IPSec for authenticating the protocol packets. This draft proposes an alternative â€“ Generic Authentication that can be used so that OSPFv3 does not depend upon IPSec for security. The mechanism introduced in this draft is generic and can be used by any protocol that currently uses IPSec for authentication.</t></abstract>
