<abstract><t>PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) design provides support for various types of deployments. Access networks can differ based on the availability of lower-layer security, placement of PANA entities, choice of client IP configuration and authentication methods, etc. This document defines a general framework for describing how these various deployment choices are handled by PANA and the access network architectures. Additionally, two possible deployments are described in detail: using PANA over DSL networks and wireless LANs.</t></abstract>
