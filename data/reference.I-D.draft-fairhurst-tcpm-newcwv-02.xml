<abstract><t>This document addresses issues that arise when TCP is used to support variable-rate traffic that exhibts periods where the transmission rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion window. It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following either an idle or applications-limited interval.  The method is expected to benefit variable-rate TCP applications, while also providing an appropriate response if congestion is experienced.  The document also evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation (CWV), an IETF experimental specification defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that CWV sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a widely used solution.  This document recommends that the IETF should consider moving RFC 2861 from Experimental to Historic status, and that this is replaced by the current specification.</t></abstract>
