<abstract><t>This document describes a file system federation protocol that enables file access and namespace traversal across collections of independently administered fileservers. The protocol specifies a set of interfaces by which fileservers and collections of fileservers with different administrators can form a fileserver federation that provides a namespace composed of the filesystems physically hosted on and exported by the constituent fileservers. RFC 2119 Keywords The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119</t></abstract>
