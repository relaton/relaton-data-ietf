<abstract><t>This document describes version 1.3 of the Ethernet Automatic Protection Switching (EAPS) (TM) technology invented by Extreme Networks to increase the availability and robustness of Ethernet rings.  An Ethernet ring built using EAPS can have resilience comparable to that provided by SONET rings, at lower cost and without some of the constraints (e.g. ring size) of SONET.</t></abstract>
