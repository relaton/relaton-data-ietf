<abstract><t>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is designed for a severe environment where communication quality is not guaranteed. It works as an overlay network associated with Bundle Protocol (BP) and some convergence layer protocols like Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP). DTN is suitable for satellite networks. Because communication delay is long and peer-to-peer communication is not guaranteed in satellite networks. We implement SDN to solve the problems of controllable, manageable, and flexible in satellite networks. In this document, we propose a framework of Software Defined DTN-based satellite networks, using Bundle tunnel and protocol translation gateway.</t></abstract>
