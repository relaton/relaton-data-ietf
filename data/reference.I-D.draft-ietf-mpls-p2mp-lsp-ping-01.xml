<abstract><t>Recent proposals have extended the scope of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineered Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) to encompass point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs. The requirement for a simple and efficient mechanism that can be used to detect data plane failures in point-to-point (P2P) MPLS LSPs has been recognised and has led to the development of techniques for fault detection and isolation commonly referred to as "LSP Ping". The scope of this document is fault detection and isolation for P2MP MPLS TE LSPs. This documents does not replace any of the mechanism of LSP Ping, but clarifies their applicability to P2MP MPLS TE LSPs, and extends the techniques and mechanisms of LSP Ping to the P2MP TE environment.</t></abstract>
