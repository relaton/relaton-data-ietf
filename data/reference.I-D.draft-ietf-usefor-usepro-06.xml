<abstract><t>This Draft, together with its companion draft [USEFOR], are intended as standards track documents, together obsoleting RFC 1036, which itself dates from 1987. This Standard defines the architecture of Netnews systems and specifies the requirements to be met by software which originates, distributes, stores and displays Netnews articles. Backward compatibility has been a major goal of this endeavour, but where this standard and earlier documents or practices conflict, this standard should be followed. In most such cases, current practice is already compatible with these changes. A companion Best Current Practice document [USEAGE], addressing requirements which are present for Social rather than Normative reasons is in preparation.</t></abstract>
