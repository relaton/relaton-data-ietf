<abstract><t>When e-mail is handed off today from one organization to another, as a rule no authentication of the sender of the e-mail or the computers delivering it on the sender’s behalf takes place. There are some simple steps which can be taken to significantly alleviate this problem, steps which mimic within the e-mail infrastructure the caller ID mechanism found in today’s telephone system. This proposal specifies that in addition to today’s practice of publishing in DNS the addresses of their incoming mail servers, administrators of domains also publish the addresses of their outgoing mail servers, the addresses of the computers from which mail legitimately originating from that domain will be sent. This information will then be used in enhancements to software that receives incoming mail to verify that computers handing off a message to them in fact are authorized to do so by the legitimate administrator of the domain from which the message is purported to have been sent.</t></abstract>
