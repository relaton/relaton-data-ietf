<abstract><t>This document provides a framework for the development of IP fast- reroute mechanisms that provide protection against link or router failure by invoking locally determined repair paths.  Unlike MPLS fast-reroute, the mechanisms are applicable to a network employing conventional IP routing and forwarding.  This document is not an  Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational  purposes.</t></abstract>
