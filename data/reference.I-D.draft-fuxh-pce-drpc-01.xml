<abstract><t>A dual-end recursive PCE-based computation procedure (DRPC) is proposed to compute shortest constrained inter-domain traffic engineering label switched paths based on BRPC in Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  By recursively performing shortest path algorithm and transferring the segmental path computation result from both ends bi-directionally, they meet at one of the middle PCEs, generating a directional shortest path graph into which the two shortest path trees are stitched together.  Therefore, the end-to-end constrained inter- domain traffic engineering label switched path, even k shortest paths can be gained from the directional shortest path graph directly.</t></abstract>
