<abstract><t>This document constitutes Revision 1 of Cryptographic Token Key Initialization Protocol (CT-KIP) Version 1.0 from RSA Laboratories' One-Time Password Specifications (OTPS) series.  The body of this document, except for the intellectual property considerations section, is taken from the CT-KIP Version 1.0 document, but comments received during the IETF review are reflected; hence, the status of a revised version.  As no &quot;bits-on-the-wire&quot; have changed, the protocol specified herein is compatible with CT-KIP Version 1.0.</t><t>CT-KIP is a client-server protocol for initialization (and configuration) of cryptographic tokens.  The protocol requires neither private-key capabilities in the cryptographic tokens, nor an established public-key infrastructure.  Provisioned (or generated) secrets will only be available to the server and the cryptographic token itself.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
