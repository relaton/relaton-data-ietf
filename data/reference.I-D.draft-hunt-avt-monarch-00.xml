<abstract><t>This memo is intended to stimulate discussion on a hierarchical monitoring architecture for RTP, including a scheme for the definition of lower-layer metrics which are usable by a range of applications.  Systematic investigation of a monitoring architecture for RTP/RTCP was requested at the IETF71 (Philadelphia) AVT session.  This first version of the draft is restricted to transport metrics and to a subset of audio application metrics, but it is envisaged that future work should extend this to other applications, principally video.</t></abstract>
