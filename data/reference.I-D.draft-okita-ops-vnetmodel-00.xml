<abstract><t>Virtual switches on server virtualization platforms cause a problem in managing data center networks containing several hundred switches. Accordingly, a management information model for the network structure of data center networks containing virtual switches is proposed.  The proposed model consists of a physical layer (which represents connections between physical switches) and a virtual layer (which represents connections between virtual switches).  These layers also represent the association of the virtual switch with the corresponding physical switch.  The model shortens the virtual LAN (VLAN) configuration time taken by operators of data center networks by a maximum of 35%.  This result shows that the proposed model is effective in reducing the management time of data center networks containing virtual switches.</t></abstract>
