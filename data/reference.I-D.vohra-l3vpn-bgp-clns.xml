<abstract><t>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use its packet switched backbone to provide Virtual Private Network services for its ISO/CLNS customers. These customers may be islands of ISO/CLNS networks which are part of the Service Provider network itself and are interconnected by the Service Provider's IP core. This method reuses the 2547 style BGP-MPLS VPN model. This document defines an ISO/CLNS VPN address family and describes the corresponding ISO/CLNS VPN route distribution mechanism using "Multiprotocol BGP".</t></abstract>
