<abstract><t>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the Internet of Things.  It was created as a common language for use in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization (OneDM) definitions.  Tools convert this format to database formats and other serializations as needed.  An SDF specification describes definitions of SDF Objects and their associated interactions (Events, Actions, Properties), as well as the Data types for the information exchanged in those interactions.  A JSON format representation of SDF 1.0 is defined in this document.</t></abstract>
