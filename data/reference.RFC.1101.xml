<abstract><t>This RFC proposes two extensions to the Domain Name System:    - A specific method for entering and retrieving RRs which map      between network names and numbers.    - Ideas for a general method for describing mappings between      arbitrary identifiers and numbers. The method for mapping between network names and addresses is a proposed standard, the ideas for a general method are experimental.</t></abstract>
