<abstract><t>Routing in mobile ad-hoc network is achieved through the mutual cooperation of mobile devices that form routes in between two mobile nodes. It is one of the challenging issues in mobile ad-hoc network [1]. The current protocols for an ad-hoc network can generally be categorized into two groups i.e. pro-active and re-active[15,23]. Pro-active protocols by continuously evaluating the known and attempting to discover new routes, try to maintain the most up-to-date view of the network[2]. This allows them to efficiently forward packets as the route is known in advanced [14]. In contrast reactive protocols determine the route only when require [3, 5, 6].  Mobile Ad-hoc On Demand Data Delivery protocol (MAODDP) support both unicast and multicast routing. MAODDP establishes route on demand and delivers the data at the same time one after the other [22]. It is designed to minimize reaction to topological changes. In order to ensure the freshness of route MAODDP uses combination of sequence numbers and broadcast ID. MAODDP is loop-free, self-starting, and can scales to different size of networks. MAODDP offers quick adaptation to the dynamic link conditions and determines routes to the destinations.</t></abstract>
