<abstract><t>The current ALTO transport is based on HTTP/1.x connections between ALTO servers and ALTO clients.  On the other hand, recent extensions to HTTP/1.x such as HTTP/2 [RFC7540] and HTTP/3 [I-D.ietf-quic-http] introduce capabilities such as server push and stream multiplexing, which can potentially be integrated into ALTO to improve ALTO capabilities such as incremental updates.  This document identifies use cases of ALTO and its extensions that may benefit from the advanced features of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and proposes ALTO extensions to fully leverage the benefits.</t></abstract>
