<abstract><t>Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, the public sector, internet-service providers, and cloud-service providers to both complement and enhance host-based security solutions.  As TLS is a widely deployed protocol to secure communication, these network- based security solutions must necessarily interact with it.  This document describes this interaction for current operational security practices and notes the impact of TLS 1.3 on them.</t></abstract>
