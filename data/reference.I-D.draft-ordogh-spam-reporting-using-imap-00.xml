<abstract><t>The Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4] does not support reporting spam on its own.  There are a number of solutions available based on the multipart/report content type defined in [REPORT]. However, these solutions require including the message contents and hence, consume bandwidth to transmit the entire message.  In bandwidth-constrained environments - such as mobile networks - it is highly desirable to send only a minimum set of information - a reference - instead of the entire message.  Furthermore, it is desirable to permit individual server implementations to handle spam in any way these systems choose to: do nothing, flag, recommend deletion or relocation, perform deletion or relocation, and, involve any choice of spam aggregator services in the decision process, such as [OMA-SPAMREP].  Solutions that exist today employ manipulating proprietary flags in the IMAP storage to achieve the bare minimum, however more advanced solutions cannot be developed by using flags only; the IMAP server needs to be involved actively in the spam reporting process.  This document specifies the syntax of the SREP command, which allows a client to inform the server that the user considered a message (or parts thereof) spam, or, that the user no longer considers a message (or parts thereof) spam.  Since all information about the message is readily available on the server, the command also allows the server to implement a more intelligent and accurate decision logic, which may be invoked when the spam is reported and the server can respond with its decision to the client.  Additionally, this document contains example flows, illustrating various decisions that the server may choose to evaluate, including invoking a service based on [OMA-SPAMREP].  This document focuses only on the client-server interactions and the scope is limited to messages that either exist on the IMAP server, or, exist elsewhere and the IMAP server is configured to access them. Consequently, deposit-time filtering, messages that have been deleted, or, exist in an external storage but are accessible via an access protocol unknown to the IMAP server are out of scope.</t></abstract>
