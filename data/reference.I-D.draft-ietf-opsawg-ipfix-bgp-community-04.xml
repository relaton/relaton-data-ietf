<abstract><t>This draft updates RFC7012 IPFIX information model by introducing several information elements to enable IPFIX to export the BGP community information, including BGP standard community defined in RFC1997, BGP extended community defined in RFC4360, and BGP large community defined in RFC8092.  Network traffic flow information can then be accumulated and analysed at the granularity specified by the BGP communities, which is suitable for and needed by some traffic optimization applications located in IPFIX collector, SDN controller or PCE (Path Computation Element).</t></abstract>
