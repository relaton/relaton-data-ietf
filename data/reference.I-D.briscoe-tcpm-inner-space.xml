<abstract><t>This document describes an experimental method to extend the limited space for control options in every segment of a TCP connection.  It can use a dual handshake so that, from the very first SYN segment, extra option space can immediately start to be used optimistically. At the same time a dual handshake prevents a legacy server from getting confused and sending the control options to the application as user-data.  The dual handshake is only one strategy - a single handshake will usually suffice once deployment has got started.  The protocol is designed to traverse most known middleboxes including connection splitters, because it sits wholly within the TCP Data.  It also provides reliable ordered delivery for control options. Therefore, it should allow new TCP options to be introduced i) with minimal middlebox traversal problems; ii) with incremental deployment from legacy servers; iii) without an extra round of handshaking delay iv) without having to provide its own loss recovery and ordering mechanism and v) without arbitrary limits on available space.</t></abstract>
