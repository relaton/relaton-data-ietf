<abstract><t>This document discusses the requirement of capability of information distribution among autonomic nodes in autonomic networks. In general, information distribution can be categorized into two different modes: 1) one autonomic node instantly sends information to other nodes in the domain; 2) one autonomic node publishes some information and asynchronously some other interested nodes request the published information. In the former case, information data will be generated and consumed instantly. In the latter case, information data live longer in the network.  These capabilities are basic and fundamental to an autonomous network system (i.e. ANI [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model]). This document clarifies possible use cases of information distribution in ANI and requirements to ANI so that rich information distribution can be natively supported. Possible options to realize the information distribution function are also briefly discussed.</t></abstract>
