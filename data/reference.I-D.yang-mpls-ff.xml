<abstract><t>A fractional-forwarding scheme is a highly compact, flexible scheme for specify routing for both traffic engineering (TE) and fast rerouting.  The ability of fractional forwarding can be a key benefit of MPLS over OSPF/IS-IS.  Many highly effective TE algorithms are proposed and evaluated based on fractional forwarding.  In this document, we propose MPLS-ff, an extension to MPLS to allow efficient implementation of fractional forwarding.  We present the required extensions in the MPLS data forwarding plane.  We also list the requirements in signaling for MPLS-ff.</t></abstract>
