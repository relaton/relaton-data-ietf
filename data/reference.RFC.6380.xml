<abstract><t>The United States Government has published guidelines for &quot;NSA Suite B Cryptography&quot; dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for national security applications.  This document specifies the conventions for using Suite B cryptography in IP Security (IPsec).</t><t>Since many of the Suite B algorithms are used in other environments, the majority of the conventions needed for the Suite B algorithms are already specified in other documents.  This document references the source of these conventions, with some relevant detail repeated to aid developers who choose to support Suite B. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
