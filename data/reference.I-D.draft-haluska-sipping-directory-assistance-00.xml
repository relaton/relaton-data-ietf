<abstract><t>Directory Assistance (DA) is a well known service in today's PSTN, and is generally identified with "411" or "NPA-555-1212" type services in North America. Today's DA services are already becoming more advanced. Currently the DA service can complete the call for the user, can send SMS with the listing to the user's wireless phone, and can provide the user with a wide range of information, such as movie listings and the weather. Moving ahead, DA providers envision exciting multimedia services that support simultaneous voice and data interactions with full operator backup at any time during the call. For instance, a DA directions service may announce and display directions to the requested listing, with the option for the caller to request transfer to an operator with the latest call context information. DA providers are planning to migrate to SIP based platforms, which will enable such advanced services, while continuing to support traditional DA services. Implementing DA services with SIP will require the exchange of certain information which is not normally exchanged for other types of calls. This document aims to identify such information, and stimulate discussion about how this information could be exchanged. Should it be decided that extensions to SIP are required, it is the authors' intention to use the SIP change process documented in [BCP 67] to attain standardization.</t></abstract>
