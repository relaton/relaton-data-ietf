<abstract><t>HTTP Level multicast, using BIER, is described as a use case in BIER Use cases document.  HTTP Level Multicast is used in today's video streaming and delivery services such as HLS, AR/VR etc., generally realized over IP Multicast.  A realization of "HTTP Multicast" over "IP Multicast" is described.  IP multicast is commonly used for IPTV services.  DVB and BBF is also developing a reference architecture for IP Multicast service.  A few problems with IPMC, such as waste of transmission bandwidth, increase in signaling when there are few users are described.  Realization over BIER, through a BIER Multicast Overlay Layer, is described.  How BIER Multicast Overlay operation improves over IP Multicast, such as reduction in signaling, dynamic creation of multicast groups to reduce signaling and bandwidth wastage is described.  We conclude with few next steps.</t></abstract>
