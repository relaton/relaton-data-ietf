<abstract><t>During recent IETF meetings, bar BOF ("birds of a feather") sessions have increasingly become indistinguishable from official IETF BOFs or sometimes even IETF working group meetings.  This document argues that this recent trend is not helpful in reaching the ultimate goal of many of these bar BOFs (i.e., to eventually initiate new IETF work).  It encourages the organizers of bar BOFs to consider the benefits of holding such get-togethers in much less formal settings.</t></abstract>
