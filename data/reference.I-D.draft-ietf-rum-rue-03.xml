<abstract><t>Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which a hearing persons can communicate with deaf/Hard of Hearing user using an interpreter ("Communications Assistant") connected via a videophone to the deaf/HoH user and an audio telephone call to the hearing user.  The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link.  Often the interpreters may be supplied by a company or agency termed a "provider" in this document.  The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service, and subsequently to CAs and other dead/HoH users.  It is desirable that the videophones used by the deaf/HoH/H-I user conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that video calls direct between deaf/HoH users work.  This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider.</t></abstract>
