<abstract><t>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer issue, it is not easy to mandate the application in the host to change in the first place, the network layer may have to have a solution to support conventional IPv4 appliation in the IPv6 only network, especially when there are multiple applications need to be supported.  This document describes the mechanism for providing the host based IPv6 translation technology which could guarantee IPv4 application backward compatible, a new well known prefix has been defined for the destination address translation and network assigned prefix will be used for source address translation.</t></abstract>
