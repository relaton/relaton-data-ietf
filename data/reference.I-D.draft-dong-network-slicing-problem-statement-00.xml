<abstract><t>The research and standardization of IMT-2020 (a.k.a. 5G) are in progress in several industry communities and standard organizations. The goal of 5G is to integrate various services, each of which has a set of unique requirements, into a single network, such that each service has a customized network suited to its needs.  The concept "Network Slicing" is widely discussed and considered as the key mechanism to meet the diverse service requirements concurrently with the same physical network infrastructure.  This document provides an overview of the concept "network slicing" in the current IMT-2020 (a.k.a. 5G) related works, and discusses the corresponding requirements on IP/MPLS network, which will be used as the mobile transport network for 5G.</t></abstract>
