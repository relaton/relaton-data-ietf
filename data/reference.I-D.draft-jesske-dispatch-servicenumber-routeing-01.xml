<abstract><t>The combination of "rn" and "npdi" parameters which are normally used for number portability (NP) can also solve numbering and routing problems.  Database dips to obtain routing numbers are not only needed for NP, but also for the routing of service numbers and short code numbers in the PSTN and also in SIP networks.  This document defines the use of the tel URI parameters defined for NP ("rn" and "npdi") to route service numbers and short code numbers.</t></abstract>
