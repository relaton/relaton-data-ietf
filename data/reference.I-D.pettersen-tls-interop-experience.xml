<abstract><t>This document presents a number of problems encountered when implementing TLS 1.0, TLS 1.0 and TLS Extensions for clients, and their consequences. The problems include servers that refuse to connect with clients supporting newer versions of the protocol, or does not handle such negotiation properly. Other problems encountered are incorrect use of values in the protocol messages. The consequences of these problems range from delayed introduction of new protocol versions and features, to fallback mechanisms that may disable protocol security features, to implementations that cannot interoperate with some other implementations.</t></abstract>
