<abstract><t>The Endpoint Cost Service maps a source-destination pair into a cost value, which provides an abstract network view based on a subset of the 2-dimension address space.  Given that the emergence of new networking datapath capabilities has substantially increased the routing flexibility, such a query space is not sufficient to uniquely identify a flow.  To address the limitations of the network information query space provided by the legacy ALTO protocol, this document takes two approaches: extending the existing ALTO cost query services with fine-grained semantics, and enabling a new flow-based query service named Flow Cost Service.  These extensions move ALTO to a more flexible and expressive network information query space.</t></abstract>
