<abstract><t>This document describes two methods for producing an integrity check value from a Diffie-Hellman key pair and one method for producing an integrity check value from an Elliptic Curve key pair.  This behavior is needed for such operations as creating the signature of a Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #10 Certification Request.  These algorithms are designed to provide a Proof-of-Possession of the private key and not to be a general purpose signing algorithm.</t><t>This document obsoletes RFC 2875.</t></abstract>
