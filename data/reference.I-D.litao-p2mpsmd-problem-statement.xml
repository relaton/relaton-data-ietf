<abstract><t>Currently, more and more Internet streaming services are getting increasingly popular among users.  Recent large-scale deployed delay- and loss-sensitive services, such as IPTV, impose stringent requirements to the streaming media delivery.  Streaming media service providers and operators have been struggling to make the QoE of the subscribers at a satisfactory level.  However, most of the existing P2MP streaming media delivery technologies, such as IP multicast, are far from ideal in the aspects of scalability, reliability and stability.  This document presents the problem statements in point to multipoint streaming media delivery, explains why network awareness and policy-based routing control should be urgently addressed for the point to multipoint streaming media delivery mechanism and introduces what should be further considered in the future.</t></abstract>
