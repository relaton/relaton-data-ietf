<abstract><t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based mobility protocol that enables mobility management for an IP host as it moves across different points of attachment within the mobility domain.  An IP host whose mobility is being managed by the network is unaware of the access networks capability providing PMIPv6 mobility management on its behalf.  This draft proposes mechanisms by which the host is informed of PMIPv6, as well as means to actively discover such capability in the network the host is attaching to.  The ability of the host to discover or be aware of PMIPv6 support in the access network enables better decision making in terms of the network selection, attach procedure, choice of mobility management, as well as the service/session and even application configuration abilities.</t></abstract>
