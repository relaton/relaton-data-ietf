<abstract><t>Email messages often contain information which might be considered private or sensitive, per either regulation or social norms.  When such a message becomes the subject of a report intended to be shared with other entities, the report generator may wish to redact or elide the sensitive portions of the message.  This memo suggests one method for doing so effectively.  [NOTE TO EDITOR: Murray Kucherawy is listed as an author only to enable him to complete the publication process on behalf of J.D. Falk.  Please remove Murray from the author list prior to publication.]</t></abstract>
