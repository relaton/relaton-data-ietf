<abstract><t>Until now, many standards was issued to standardize creating and managing IDN (Internationalized Domain Names), all those standards discussed the technical problem issued from the need to keep the structure of the internet that uses standard (ASCII) domain names untouched; using this pretext those standards forced some rules that make lingual grammars for some languages not respected on the language domain names. This document will try to define a new type of domain names called the 'multilingual domain names' (MLDNs) , these names are supposed to espect the grammatical and spelling of every language so at least, every language can use the words of its own dictionary in its own domain names. The system supposed to manage the reservation and the resolution of the new domain names (MLDNs) must also respect the infrastructure of the traditional domain names system (DNS) untouched so it will not jeopardize the stability of the internet. In the rest of the document we will refer to that system by MLDNS (Multi-Lingual Domain Names System). MLDNS Will use the same large repertoire of Unicode characters to compose its domain names and that means the use of none-ASCII characters, this use must allow all languages to have their domain names that respect their language properties and rules. Also it must depends on a technique that keeps the stable DNS system untouched.</t></abstract>
