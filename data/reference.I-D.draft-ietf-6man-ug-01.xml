<abstract><t>The IPv6 addressing architecture includes a unicast interface identifier that is used in the creation of many IPv6 addresses. Interface identifiers are formed by a variety of methods.  This document clarifies that the bits in an interface identifier have no generic meaning and that the identifier should be treated as an opaque value.  In particular, RFC 4291 defines a method by which the Universal and Group bits of an IEEE link-layer address are mapped into an IPv6 unicast interface identifier.  This document clarifies that those bits apply only to interface identifiers that are derived from an IEEE link-layer address.  It updates RFC 4291 accordingly.</t></abstract>
