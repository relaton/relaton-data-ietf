<abstract><t>Many research and maker platforms for Internet of Things experimentation offer a serial interface.  This is often used for programming, diagnostic output, as well as a crude command interface ("AT interface").  Alternatively, it is often used with SLIP (RFC1055) to transfer IP packets only.  The present report describes how to use a single serial interface for diagnostics, configuration commands and state readback, as well as packet transfer.</t></abstract>
