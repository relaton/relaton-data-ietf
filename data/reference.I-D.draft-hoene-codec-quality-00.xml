<abstract><t>The quality of a codec has to be measured by multiple parameters such as audio quality, speech quality, algorithmic efficiency, latency, coding rates and their respective tradeoffs. During standardization, codecs are tested and evaluated multiple times to ensure a high quality outcome.  As the upcoming Internet codec is likely to have unique features, there is a need to develop new quality testing procedures to measure these features. Thus, this draft reviews existing methods on how to measure a codec's qualities, proposes a couple of new methods, and gives suggestions which may be used for testing the Internet Interactive Audio Codec (IIAC).  This document is work in progress.</t></abstract>
