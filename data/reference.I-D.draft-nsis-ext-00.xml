<abstract><t>This document discusses the Next Steps in Signaling extensibility model.  This model is based upon a two-layer model, where there is a transport layer and a signaling application model.  This two-layer provides the ability to develop new signaling applications, while retaining the use of a common transport layer.  This document will serve as guidance on how the NSIS architecture can be extended.</t></abstract>
