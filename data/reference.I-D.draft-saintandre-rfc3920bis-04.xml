<abstract><t>This document defines the core features of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), a technology for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements in order to exchange structured information in close to real time between any two or more network- aware entities.  XMPP provides a generalized, extensible framework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon which a variety of applications can be built.  The framework includes methods for stream setup and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of a client to a server and of one server to another server, and primitives for push-style messages, publication of network availability information ("presence"), and request-response interactions between any two XMPP entities.  This document also specifies the format for XMPP addresses, which are fully internationalizable.  This document obsoletes RFC 3920.</t></abstract>
