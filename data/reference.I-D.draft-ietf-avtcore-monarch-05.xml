<abstract><t>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new RTCP XR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media transmission or reception quality, following RTCP guideline established in RFC5968.  This memo suggests that a new block should contain a single metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single parameter of interest or concern, rather than containing a number of metrics which attempt to provide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a specific application.  Applications may then "mix and match" to create a set of blocks which covers their set of concerns.  Where possible, a specific block should be designed to be re-usable across more than one application, for example, for all of voice, streaming audio and video.</t></abstract>
