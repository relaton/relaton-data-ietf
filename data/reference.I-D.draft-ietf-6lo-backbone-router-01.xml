<abstract><t>This specification proposes an update to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, to enhance the operation of IPv6 over wireless links that exhibit lossy multicast support, and enable a large degree of scalability by splitting the broadcast domains.  A higher speed backbone federates multiple wireless links to form a large MultiLink Subnet.  Backbone Routers acting as Layer-3 Access Point route packets to registered nodes, where an classical Layer-2 Access Point would bridge. Conversely, wireless nodes register to the Backbone Router to setup routing services in a fashion that is essentially similar to a classical Layer-2 association.</t></abstract>
