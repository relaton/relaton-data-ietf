<abstract><t>This memo defines the name based sockets.  A new address family (AF_NAME) allows the application developer to pass on all IP (locator) management to the operating system.  Applications are thus relieved of re-implementing features such as multi-homing, mobility and general address management and allowing the operating system can re-use the same solutions for a whole set of guest applications.</t></abstract>
