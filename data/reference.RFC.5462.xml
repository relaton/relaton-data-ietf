<abstract><t>The early Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) documents defined the form of the MPLS label stack entry.  This includes a three-bit field called the &quot;EXP field&quot;.  The exact use of this field was not defined by these documents, except to state that it was to be &quot;reserved for experimental use&quot;.</t><t>Although the intended use of the EXP field was as a &quot;Class of Service&quot; (CoS) field, it was not named a CoS field by these early documents because the use of such a CoS field was not considered to be sufficiently defined.  Today a number of standards documents define its usage as a CoS field.</t><t>To avoid misunderstanding about how this field may be used, it has become increasingly necessary to rename this field.  This document changes the name of the field to the &quot;Traffic Class field&quot; (&quot;TC field&quot;).  In doing so, it also updates documents that define the current use of the EXP field.
