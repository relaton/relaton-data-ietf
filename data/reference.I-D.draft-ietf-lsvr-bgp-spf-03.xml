<abstract><t>Many Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs) have converged on simplified layer 3 routing.  Furthermore, requirements for operational simplicity have lead many of these MSDCs to converge on BGP as their single routing protocol for both their fabric routing and their Data Center Interconnect (DCI) routing.  This document describes a solution which leverages BGP Link-State distribution and the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm similar to Internal Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF.</t></abstract>
