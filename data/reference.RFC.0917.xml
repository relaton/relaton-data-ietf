<abstract><t>This memo discusses subnets and proposes procedures for the use of    subnets, including approaches to solving the problems that arise,    particularly that of routing.  A subnet of an Internet network is a    logically visible sub-section of a single Internet network.  For    administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to    divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a    set of Internet network numbers.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol    for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions    for improvements.</t></abstract>
