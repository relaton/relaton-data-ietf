<abstract><t>One advantage that MPLS provides is that it allows traffic to be directed through an explicit path that deviates from IP routing. Such ability is widely used in traffic-engineering and fast-reroute. Currently signaling protocols such as RSVP is needed to establish and maintain such an explicit Label Switched Path. When there are a large number of such signaled LSPs in the network, the aggregated signaling and maintenance overhead can be significant. In this paper, we propose a way to establish a source routed explicit path with zero signaling overhead. The scheme uses a stack of labels and requires domain wide LDP FEC to label bindings.</t></abstract>
