<abstract><t>This document describes an experimental use case that employs autonomic networking for the monitoring of Service Level Agreements (SLAs).  The use case is for detecting violations of SLAs in a distributed fashion.  It strives to optimize and dynamically adapt the autonomic deployment of active measurement probes in a way that maximizes the likelihood of detecting service-level violations with a given resource budget to perform active measurements.  This optimization and adaptation should be done without any outside guidance or intervention.</t><t>This document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research Group (NMRG).  It is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
