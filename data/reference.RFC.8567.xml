<abstract><t>Maintaining high Quality of Experience (QoE) increasingly requires end-to-end, holistic network management, including managed Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  Because customer management is a shared global responsibility, the Domain Name System (DNS) provides an ideal existing infrastructure for maintaining authoritative customer information that must be readily, reliably, and publicly accessible.</t><t>This document describes four new DNS resource record types for encoding customer information in the DNS.  These records are intended to better facilitate high customer QoE via inter-provider cooperation and management of customer data.</t></abstract>
