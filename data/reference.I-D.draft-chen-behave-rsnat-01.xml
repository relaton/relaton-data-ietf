<abstract><t>For the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address pool against the slow development of IPv6, IPv4/6 coexistence/transition proved to be a long period.  In the IPv4/6 transition process, there are many NAT- like technologies existing in the internet.  However the NAT boxes such as IPv4 NAT, IPv4/6 NAT is insufficient in their reliability and scalability, which might cause a single point of failure in IPv4/6 transition architecture.  This document defines a reliable and scalable NAT(RS-NAT) mechanism to solve the problem.</t></abstract>
