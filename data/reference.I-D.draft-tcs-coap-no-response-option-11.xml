<abstract><t>There can be M2M scenarios where responses from server against requests from client might be considered redundant. This kind of open-loop exchange (with no response path from the server to the client) may be desired to minimize resource consumption in constrained systems while simultaneously updating a bulk of resources or updating a resource with a very high frequency. CoAP already provides a non-confirmable (NON) mode of message exchange where the server end-point does not respond with ACK. However, obeying the request/response semantics, the server end-point responds back with a status code indicating "the result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request".  This draft introduces a header option for CoAP called 'No-Response'. Using this option the client explicitly tells the server to suppress responses against the particular request. This option also provides granular control to enable suppression of a particular class or a combination of response-classes. This option may be effective for both unicast and multicast requests. Present draft also discusses few exemplary applications which benefit from this option.</t></abstract>
