<abstract><t>This document provides an architectural framework for network telemetry to address the current and future network operation challenges and requirements.  As evidenced by the defining characteristics and industry practice, network telemetry covers technologies and protocols beyond the conventional network Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM).  Network telemetry promises better flexibility, scalability, accuracy, coverage, and performance and allows automated control loops to suit both today's and tomorrow's network operation requirements.  This document clarifies the terminologies and classifies the modules and components of a network telemetry system.  The framework and taxonomy help to set a common ground for the collection of related work and provide guidance for future technique and standard developments.</t></abstract>
