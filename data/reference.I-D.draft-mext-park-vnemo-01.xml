<abstract><t>A mobile network can be multihomed as described in [RFC4980].  This document describes the experimental result of service differentiation using multihoming of multiple prefixes. The multiple prefixes in IPv6 NEMO implements multiple virtual mobile network on a single physical NEMO.  Then, service differentiation can be achieved using several virtual mobile networks that exist on a single mobile network.  As a result, this configuration can be used for service differentiation for each mobile network node inside the mobile network by prioritizing among the virutal mobile networks or forwarding traffic from each virtual mobile network to different access networks.  In this experiment, a mobile router with multiple interfaces can make connection to several access networks simultaneoulsly.</t></abstract>
