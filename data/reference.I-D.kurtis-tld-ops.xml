<abstract><t>The Internet is today the defacto standard packet network for a lot of critical communications. The Internet in turn have a heavy dependency on the Domain Name System (DNS) for it's "normal" operations. The IETF in June 2000 described the operating requirements [1]for the so called root-servers that defines the root of the DNS lookup tree. Similar requirements could where deemed needed be applied to DNS infrastructure at other levels of the DNS tree as well. This document analyses these requirements and what can be done to ensure a reliable DNS infrastructure.</t></abstract>
