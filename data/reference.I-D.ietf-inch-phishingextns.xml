<abstract><t>This document extends the INCH WG's IODEF XML incident reporting format for reporting phishing, fraud, other types of electronic crime, and widespread spam incidents. Although the term "phishing attack" is used, the data format extensions are flexible enough to support information gleaned from activities throughout the entire electronic fraud life cycle and extensible enough to be used for other types of electronic crime incidents, along with simple spam. The extensions support very simple reporting as well as optional fields for detailed forensic reports, and support single phish/fraud incidents as well as consolidated reports of multiple phish incidents. Sections 1 and 2 of this document introduce the high-level report format. Sections 3 and 4 describe the data elements of the fraud extensions. This document includes an XML schema for the extensions and a few example fraud reports.</t></abstract>
