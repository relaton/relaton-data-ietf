<abstract><t>Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the Endpoint Cost Service.  Future extensions to ALTO may also use Cost Metric.  Different applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics.  For example, a Resource Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that have low delay to the Resource Consumer.  However the base ALTO protocol [ALTO] has defined only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).  In this document, we define eleven Cost Metrics, derived from OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE, to measure network delay, jitter, packet loss, hop count, and bandwidth.  The metrics defined in this document provide a relatively comprehensive set of Cost Metrics for ALTO focusing on traffic engineering (TE).  Additional Cost Metrics such as financial cost metrics may be defined in other documents.</t></abstract>
