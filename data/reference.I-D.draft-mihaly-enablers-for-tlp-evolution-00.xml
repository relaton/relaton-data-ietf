<abstract><t>In this document we collected requirements for TLP evolution. These requirements are the consequence of removing obstacles of TLP evolution. This results in a higher variety of expected TLP implementations and lower trust level in these. Confidentiality of communication and security is more and more important. Middleboxes which today are one of the obstacles of the evolution shall be taken into account and incentivized to cooperate in the future landscape. Resulting from the requirements we propose areas for further investigation.</t></abstract>
