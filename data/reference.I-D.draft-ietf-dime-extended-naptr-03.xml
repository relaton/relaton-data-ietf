<abstract><t>The Diameter base protocol specifies mechanisms whereby a given realm may advertise Diameter nodes and the supported transport protocol. However, these mechanism do not reveal the Diameter applications that each node supports.  A peer outside the realm would have to perform a Diameter capability exchange with every node in order to discover which one supports a required application.  This document describes an improvement using an extended format for the Straightfoward-NAPTR (S-NAPTR) Application Service Tag that allows for discovery of the supported applications without doing Diameter capability exchange beforehand.</t></abstract>
