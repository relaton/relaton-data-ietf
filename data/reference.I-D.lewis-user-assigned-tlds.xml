<abstract><t>The practice governing the delegation of ASCII two-letter domain names in the DNS root zone is to follow the ISO 3166-1 standard?s alpha 2 codes. This standard is maintained by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency. Contained within the gamut of ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 codes is a set of values designated as User Assigned.  This document recommends that values designated as user assigned be reserved from delegation in the root zone.  A specific range of these codes is assigned expressly for private-use.</t></abstract>
