<abstract><t>With the increase number of protocols and applications that rely on digital certificates to authenticate either the communication channel (TLS) or the data itself (PKIX), the need for providing an efficient revocation system is paramount.  Although the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) allows for efficient lookup of the revocation status of a certificate, the distribution of this information via HTTP or HTTPS is not particularly efficient for high volume websites without incurring in high distribution costs (e.g., CDN).  This draft describes how to provide pre-signed OCSP responses via the DNS system in order to leverage its distributed nature and, therefore lowering operational costs for Certification Authorities.</t></abstract>
