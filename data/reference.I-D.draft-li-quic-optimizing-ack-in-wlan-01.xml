<abstract><t>The dependence on frequent acknowledgments (ACKs) is an artifact of current transport protocol designs rather than a fundamental requirement.  This document analyzes the problems caused by contentions and collisions on wireless medium between data packets and ACKs in WLAN and it proposes an ACK mechanism that minimizes the intensity of ACK Frame in QUIC, improving the performance of transport layer connection.</t></abstract>
