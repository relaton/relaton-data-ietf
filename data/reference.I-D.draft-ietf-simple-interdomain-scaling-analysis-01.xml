<abstract><t>The document analyses the traffic that is generated due to presence subscriptions between domains. It is shown that the amount of traffic can be extremely big. In addition to the very large traffic the document also analyses the affects of a large presence system on the memory footprint and the CPU load. Current approved and in work optimizations to the SIMPLE protocol are analysed with the possible impact on the load. Separate documents contain the requirements for optimizations and suggestions for new optimizations.</t></abstract>
