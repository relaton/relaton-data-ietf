<abstract><t>This document defines the core of the QUIC transport protocol.  QUIC provides applications with flow-controlled streams for structured communication, low-latency connection establishment, and network path migration.  QUIC includes security measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a range of deployment circumstances.  Accompanying documents describe the integration of TLS for key negotiation, loss detection, and an exemplary congestion control algorithm.</t><t> DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF QUIC</t><t> DO NOT DEPLOY THIS VERSION OF QUIC UNTIL IT IS IN AN RFC.  This version is still a work in progress.  For trial deployments, please use earlier versions.</t><t> Note to Readers</t><t> Discussion of this draft takes place on the QUIC working group mailing list (quic@ietf.org (mailto:quic@ietf.org)), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=quic</t><t> Working Group information can be found at https://github.com/quicwg; source code and issues list for this draft can be found at https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/labels/-transport.</t></abstract>
