<abstract><t>This document describes an address configuration mechanism based on the concept of address pool allocation in the connected MANET. The Internet gateway acts as a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server and assigns not a single address but a part of its address pool to an address requesting node and, then, the node can assign a part of its own address pool to its neighbor nodes. By doing this, the address allocation procedure can be expedited.</t></abstract>
