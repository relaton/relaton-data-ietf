<abstract><t>TCP congestion control is based on the assumption that the end-to-end path of a connection changes only insignificantly after connection establishment. Network layer mobility protocols that change a connection's point of attachment transparently to the transport layer may violate this assumption and cause TCP to make congestion control decisions based on invalid information. This document describes a TCP option that allows a connection endpoint to inform a peer when it changes location. This document also outlines the proper congestion control behavior that should take place in the face of such network layer mobility.</t></abstract>
