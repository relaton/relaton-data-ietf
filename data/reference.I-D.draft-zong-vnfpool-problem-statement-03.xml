<abstract><t>Network functions are traditionally implemented on specialized hardware and less on commodity server, but there is a clear trend to implement a number of network functions, such as firewall or load balancer, as software on virtualized computing platforms.  These virtualized functions are called Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs).  We call a group of such VNFs a VNF set, which can be used to build network services.  The use of VNF set to build network services introduces additional challenges on reliability, such as additional points of failure and the need to coordinate various VNFs in a VNF set.  This document discusses the problems related to the reliability of VNF set.  A VNF pooling architecture is also briefly introduced, as well as related IETF protocols.</t></abstract>
