<abstract><t>This document lists logging capabilities originally identified in Operational Security Requirements for Large Internet Service Provider (ISP) IP Network Infrastructure [RFC3871] and needed to support current operational practices, including those described in Operational Security Current Practices In Internet Service Provider Environments [RFC4778].  Logging is defined as the delivery of messages about the device, the data passing through the device, or the device's interaction with another device and has been traditionally provided via the syslog or SNMP protocols.</t></abstract>
