<abstract><t>S/MIME uses certificates for authenticating and encrypting messages. Users want their mail user agents to securely associate a certificate with the sender of an encrypted and/or signed message.  DNSSEC provides a mechanism for a zone operator to sign DNS information directly.  This way, bindings of certificates to users within a domain are asserted not by external entities, but by the entities that operate the DNS.  This document describes how to use secure DNS to associate an S/MIME user's certificate with the intended domain name.  IMPORTANT NOTE: This draft is intentionally sketchy.  It is meant as a possible starting point for the DANE WG if it wants to consider making a protocol similar to TLSA, as described in draft-ietf-dane-protocol, but that applies to S/MIME.  The WG may or may not want to adopt such work, or if it does, may want to use a very different scheme from the one described here.</t></abstract>
