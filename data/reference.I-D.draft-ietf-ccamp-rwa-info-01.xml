<abstract><t>This document provides a model of information needed by the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in wavelength switched optical networks (WSONs).  The purpose of the information described in this model is to facilitate constrained lightpath computation in WSONs, particularly in cases where there are no or a limited number of wavelength converters available. This model currently does not include optical impairments.</t></abstract>
