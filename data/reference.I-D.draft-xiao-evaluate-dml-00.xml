<abstract><t>In some scenarios, the multiplicity of network management models implies the use of multiple management data modeling languages, which are used to model the resources to be managed. Each language differs in the level of various capabilities and expressiveness, most of which are not easily measured. However, existing data modeling languages have drawbacks of different levels, which hinder them in adapting to the requirements of next generation network management. The aim of our project is then to establish a framework of evaluation to compare different management data modeling languages based on a set of criteria, the most important part of which are demonstrated in this memo, being modeling approaches, expressiveness, readability, interoperability, extensibility and others, and present some perspectives on developing future data modeling languages for next generation network management, possibly integrating existing ones. Thus, this memo summarizes the characteristics of existing data modeling languages through comparison based on given criteria for evaluation.</t></abstract>
