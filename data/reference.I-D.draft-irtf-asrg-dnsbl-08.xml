<abstract><t>The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has led to the creation of shared blacklists and whitelists of IP addresses or domains.  The DNS has become the de-facto standard method of distributing these blacklists and whitelists.  This memo documents the structure and usage of DNS based blacklists and whitelists, and the protocol used to query them.  IRTF Notice  This document is a product of the Anti-Spam Research Group (ASRG) of the Internet Research Task Force.  It represents the consensus of the ASRG with respect to practices to improve interoperability of DNS based blacklists and whitelists, but does not constitute an IETF or Internet standard.  [NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: Please remove this paragraph in publication.] Comments and discussion may be directed to the ASRG mailing list, asrg@irtf.org.</t></abstract>
