<abstract><t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple authentication methods.  One such method is Generic Token Card (EAP-GTC) which, despite its name, is commonly used to support authentication using cleartext passwords in tunneled EAP methods. EAP-GTC does not provide the ability to change a password (for example, an expired password), however.  This document defines the PassWord Change EAP method (EAP-PWC) in order to fill that void in functionality.</t></abstract>
