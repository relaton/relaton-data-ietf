<abstract><t>Delayed Acknowledgments (ACKs) allow reducing protocol overhead in many scenarios.  However, in some cases, Delayed ACKs may significantly degrade network and device performance in terms of link utilization, latency, memory usage and/or energy consumption.  This document defines the TCP ACK Pull (AKP) mechanism, which allows a sender to request the ACK for a data segment to be sent without additional delay by the receiver.  AKP makes use of one of the reserved bits in the TCP header, which is defined in this specification as the AKP flag.</t></abstract>
