<abstract><t>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocols has been defined to control different switching technologies as well as different applications. These include support for requesting TDM connections including SONET/SDH and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). This document provides the extensions of the IETF Link State Routing Protocols to meet the routing requirements for an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON) as defined by ITU-T.</t></abstract>
