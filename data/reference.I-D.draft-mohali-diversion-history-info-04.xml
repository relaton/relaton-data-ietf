<abstract><t>The Diversion header is not standardized but widely used to convey diverting information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling. This informational document proposes a way to interwork call diversion information contained in Diversion header with a History- Info header.  In addition, an interworking policy is proposed to manage the headers coexistence. The History-Info header is described in [RFC4244] and the Diversion header is described in [draft-levy-sip-diversion-09]. Note to the RFC-Editor: The reference to this draft should be replaced by the Historic RFC reference (work in progress). Since the Diversion header is used in many existing networks implementations for transport of diversion information and its interworking with standardized solutions is not obvious, an interworking recommendation is needed.</t></abstract>
