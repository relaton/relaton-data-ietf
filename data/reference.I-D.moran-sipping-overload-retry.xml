<abstract><t>SIP servers can become overload and unable to handle all SIP messages they receive.  Even though the SIP protocol provides a limited overload control mechanism through its 503 (Service Unavailable) response code, SIP servers are still vulnerable to overload.  This document proposes an architecture for determining when a client should throttle the sending of SIP requests vs. retrying them.</t></abstract>
