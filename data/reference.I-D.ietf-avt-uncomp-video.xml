<abstract><t>This memo specifies a packetization scheme for encapsulating uncompressed video into a payload format for the Real-time Transport Protocol, RTP. It supports a range of standard- and high-definition video formats, including common television formats such as ITU BT.601, and standards from the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), such as SMPTE 274M and SMPTE 296M. The format is designed to be applicable and extensible to new video formats as they are developed.</t></abstract>
