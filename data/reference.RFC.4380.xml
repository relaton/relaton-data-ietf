<title>Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through Network Address Translations (NATs)</title>
<author initials='C.' surname='Huitema' fullname='C. Huitema'><organization /></author>
<date year='2006' month='February' />
<abstract><t>We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or more IPv4 Network Address Translations (NATs) to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP; we call this the Teredo service.  Running the service requires the help of &quot;Teredo servers&quot; and &quot;Teredo relays&quot;.  The Teredo servers are stateless, and only have to manage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relays act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the &quot;native&quot; IPv6 Internet.  The relays can also provide interoperability with hosts using other transition mechanisms such as &quot;6to4&quot;.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
