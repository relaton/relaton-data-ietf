<abstract><t>The increasingly ubiquitous availability of broadband, together with flat-rate pricing, have made the use of new kinds of peer-to-peer applications increasingly common.  From the perspective of the Internet's evolution and its contributions to end user value, this is very exciting.  However, the uptick in peer-to-peer application usage has also contributed to the rise of "high-consuming users" who take their flat-rate contracts to the limit by continuously file-sharing to the maximum extent possible.  Network operators have responded to this phenomenon in a number of different fashions.  This document discusses the problems created for operators by high- consuming users and illustrates a number of techniques operators are currently using to cope with high bandwidth usage.</t></abstract>
