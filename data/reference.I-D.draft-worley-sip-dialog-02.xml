<abstract><t>This document sets out guidelines for how user agents should implement the dialog event package in order to be usable in systems that implement end-point controlled call-control (EPCC) features. The guidelines are in addition to the basic requirements for dialog event package implementation in RFC 3265 and RFC 4235. Five current commercial implementations are compared with the guidelines.</t></abstract>
