<abstract><t>The specific mechanism described in the current PMIPv6 draft to support multihoming is such that a unique prefix is given to each interface of a Mobile Node (MN) that is attached to the PMIPv6 domain.  However, multihoming can also be provided using same unique prefix for all interfaces of MN similar to the MONAMI6 (Mobile Nodes and Multiple Interfaces in IPv6) concept.  This memo explores and highlights lack of advanced multihoming support and other hand-off related issues where appropriate in three different mobility management protocol models for multiple interfaced mobile nodes. Firstly, when single prefix is allocated for all interfaces of MN in the PMIPv6 domain.  Secondly, when unique prefix is allocated for each interface as in PMIPv6 standard protocol model.  Thirdly, when a multiple interfaced node uses different mobility management mechanisms for each of its interfaces.</t></abstract>
