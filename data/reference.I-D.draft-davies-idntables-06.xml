<abstract><t>This document describes a method of representing the domain name registration policy for a zone administrator using Extensible Markup Language (XML).  These policies, known as "Label Generation Rulesets" (LGRs), are particularly used for the implementation of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).  The rulesets are used to implement and share policy defining which labels and specific Unicode code points are permitted for registrations, which alternative code points are considered variants, and what actions may be performed on labels containing those variants.</t></abstract>
