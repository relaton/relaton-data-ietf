<abstract><t>This I-D lists and describes issues related to receiver access control in current multicasting protocols which are especially important to commercial, large-scale multicasting. A few common business models for content and network provision are presented to provide background and explain the motivation of this work. Four existing possible multicasting architectures (with or without some form of access or content control) are presented. Then each architecture is analyzed with respect to how it can or cannot satisfactorily address each issue. This I-D concludes that for many of these issues the possible architectures based on present standards as they now exist require non-standardized solutions to meet common use requirements. This I-D recommends for requirements to be defined that would set the groundwork for creating standardized ways to overcome these limitations.</t></abstract>
