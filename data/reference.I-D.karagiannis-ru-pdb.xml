<abstract><t>This draft specifies a Per Domain Behavior that provides the ability to Diffserv nodes located outside Diffserv domain(s), e.g., receiver or other Diffserv enabled router to detect when the resources provided by the Diffserv domain(s) are not available. The unavailability of resources in the domain is monitored and detected by proportionally marking packets whenever the current link rate exceeds some pre-configured SLS agreed throughput (bandwidth) threshold. It is considered that the SLS agreed throughput threshold is not statically but loosely defined in order to allow a more efficient utilization of the Diffserv domain(s) and a simpler network management operation. This PDB can be applied in association with either a single Diffserv domain or multiple neighboring Diffserv domains, when a trust relationship exist between these multiple Diffserv domains. This specification is denoted as Resource Unavailability (RU) PDB and it follows the guidelines given in [RFC3086].</t></abstract>
