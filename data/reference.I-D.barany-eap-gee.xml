<abstract><t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a general authentication protocol that supports multiple authentication methods and typically runs directly over data link layers without requiring IP. EAP can be used for different types of authentication, where multiple providers provide different services. However, EAP itself does not have the ability to differentiate between multiple EAP conversations between a peer and an authenticator. This document specifies the 3GPP2 Generic EAP Encapsulation (GEE) protocol for differentiating between multiple EAP conversations between a peer and an authenticator.</t></abstract>
