<abstract><t>A single representation for 4-byte AS numbers is proposed, to avoid any confusion in interpreting the two 2-byte quantities that make them. The syntax chosen avoids collision with BGP community string parsing of AS numbers. It is recommended that only this representation be used by all documents and systems referring to 4-byte AS numbers.</t></abstract>
