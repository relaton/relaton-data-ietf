<abstract><t>The File Transfer Protocol does not offer any method to verify the integrity of a transferred file, nor can two files be compared against each other without actually transferring them first. Cryptographic hashes are a possible solution to this problem.  In the past, several attempts have been made to add commands to obtain checksums and hashes, however none have been formally specified, leading to non-interoperability and confusion.  To solve these issues, this document specifies a new FTP command to be used by clients to request cryptographic hashes of files.</t></abstract>
