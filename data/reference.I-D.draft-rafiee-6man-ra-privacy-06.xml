<abstract><t>Privacy is an important issue that concerns many governments and users and its importance becoming more evident every day. Nodes change their IP addresses frequently in order to avoid being tracked by attackers. The act of frequently changing IP addresses also helps in preventing nodes from leaking information. In IPv6 networks there is currently one solution for maintaining the privacy of nodes when IPv6 StateLess Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) (RFC 4862) is used. Unfortunately there are some problems associated with this solution which entails the use of the Privacy Extension (RFC 4941). One of the issues with this RFC concerns the wording that is used that allows the implementation to make the choice as to what approach to use, and in so doing, in some cases, the choice made is not the most prudent or best approach, and this thus is not ideal and can lead to some problems. Some of these problems are related to not generating a new Interface ID (IID) after changing the router prefix. Another concern is the fact that nodes may use an IID that was generated based on a MAC address as a public address, and then use this in their response. The act of cutting the current connections to other nodes, if the max lifetime of the old IID has elapsed, is also not clearly explained nor is whether or not the already used IID should be kept in stable storage, There is also a concern about the need to have stable storage available for the generation of a randomized IID. The document also did not clearly explain how to use the same approach, for the random value generation in all implementations, when there is a lack of available stable storage. The purpose of this document is to address these issues; to update the current RFC.</t></abstract>
