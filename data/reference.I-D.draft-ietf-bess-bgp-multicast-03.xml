<abstract><t>This document specifies a BGP address family and related procedures that allow BGP to be used for setting up multicast distribution trees.  This document also specifies procedures that enable BGP to be used for multicast source discovery, and for showing interest in receiving particular multicast flows.  Taken together, these procedures allow BGP to be used as a replacement for other multicast routing protocols, such as PIM or mLDP.  The BGP procedures specified here are based on the BGP multicast procedures that were originally designed for use by providers of Multicast Virtual Private Network service.</t><t> This document also describes how various signaling mechanisms can be used to set up end-to-end inter-region multiast trees.</t></abstract>
