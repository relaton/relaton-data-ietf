<abstract><t>This RFC provides the common definitions for the structure and identification of management information for TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, together with its companion memos, which describe the initial management information base along with the initial network management protocol, these documents provide a simple, working architecture and system for managing TCP/IP-based internets and in particular, the Internet.
