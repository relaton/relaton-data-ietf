<abstract><t>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) document (RFC 6503) defines a way for a client to discover a conference control server that supports CCMP.  However, it does not define a way for a client involved in a conference to determine if the conference focus supports CCMP.  This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the Centralized Conferencing (XCON) conference event package and take advantage of CCMP operations on the conference.</t><t>This document describes two mechanisms, depending upon the need of the User Agent (UA), to address the above limitation.  The first mechanism uses the Call-Info header field, and the second mechanism defines a new value for the &quot;purpose&quot; header field parameter in the &lt;service-uris&gt; element in the SIP conferencing event package.</t></abstract>
