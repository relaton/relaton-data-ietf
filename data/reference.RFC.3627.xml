<title>Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers Considered Harmful</title>
<author initials='P.' surname='Savola' fullname='P. Savola'><organization /></author>

<abstract><t>In some cases, the operational decision may be to use IPv6 /127 prefix lengths, especially on point-to-point links between routers.  Under certain situations, this may lead to one router claiming both addresses due to subnet-router anycast being implemented.  This document discusses the issue and offers a couple of solutions to the problem; nevertheless, /127 should be avoided between two routers.</t></abstract>
