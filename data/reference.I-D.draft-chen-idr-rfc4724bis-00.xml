<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize the negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart.  An End-of-RIB marker is specified and can be used to convey routing convergence information.  A new BGP capability, termed "Graceful Restart Capability", is defined that would allow a BGP speaker to express its ability to preserve its forwarding state during BGP restart, as well as to convey its intention of generating the End-of-RIB marker upon the completion of its initial routing update.  Finally, procedures are outlined for temporarily retaining routing information across a TCP session termination/re-establishment.  The mechanisms described in this document are applicable to all routers, both those with the ability to preserve the forwarding state during BGP restart and those without (although the latter need to implement only a subset of the mechanisms described in this document).</t></abstract>
