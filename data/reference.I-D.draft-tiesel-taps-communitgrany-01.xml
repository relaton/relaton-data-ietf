<abstract><t>This document provides guidelines how to reason about the composition of multi-path aware systems and how to compose the functionality needed by stacking existing protocols.  It discusses fundamental mechanisms that are used in multi-path systems and the consequences of applying them to different granularities of communication units. This document is targeted as consideration basis for automation of destination selection, path selection, and transport protocol selection.</t></abstract>
