<abstract><t>In this document, it identifies gateways for field-bus networks, data storages for archiving and developing data sharing platform, and application units to be important system components for developing digital communities: i.e., building-scale and city-wide ubiquitous facility networking infrastructure.  The standard defines a data exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects these components (gateways, storages, application units) over the IPv4/v6-based networks.  This enables integration of multiple facilities, data storages, application services such as central management, energy saving, environmental monitoring and alarm notification systems.</t></abstract>
