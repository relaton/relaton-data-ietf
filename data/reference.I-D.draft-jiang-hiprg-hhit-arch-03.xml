<abstract><t>The current flat-structured Host Identity Tag architecture has various problems and limitation. Hence, a hierarchical HIT architecture that is compatible with the flat-structured HIT architecture is introduced in the document. This architecture and the process of HIT generation ensure the global uniqueness of HITs. This architecture also enables the multiple Host Identity Protocol administrative domains, solves the deployment problem of current flat-structured HIT architecture. It also enhances the scalability and resolution efficiency of the mapping system from HIT to IP or FQDN.</t></abstract>
