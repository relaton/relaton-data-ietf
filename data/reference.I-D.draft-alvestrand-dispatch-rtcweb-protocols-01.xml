<abstract><t>This document gives an overview and context of a protocol suite intended for use with real-time applications that can be deployed in browsers - "real time communication on the Web".  It intends to serve as a starting and coordination point to make sure all the parts that are needed to achieve this goal are findable, and that the parts that belong in the Internet protocol suite are fully specified and on the right publication track.  This work is an attempt to synthesize the input of many people, but makes no claims to fully represent the views of any of them.  All parts of the document should be regarded as open for discussion, with the intended discussion forum being the "RTCWEB" WG (in formation).  Currently, discussion is on the rtc-web@alvestrand.no mailing list.</t></abstract>
