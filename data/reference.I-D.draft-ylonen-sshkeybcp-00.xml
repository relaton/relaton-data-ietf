<abstract><t>This document presents current recommended practice for configuring, managing, auditing, and associated policies around automated access to information systems, with particular emphasis on SSH user keys as authentication and authorization tokens but also looking into other automated access mechanisms, such as Kerberos.  Starting with a review of authentication methods that can be configured for automated access, the document describes the risks involved when the management of automated access and SSH keys is neglected.  It scopes the extent of the problem in particular organizations, provides a detailed roadmap for bringing automated access and SSH keys under control, and presents recommendations on continuous monitoring and ongoing management of automated access in information systems.  Various remedial actions are presented and mapped to the problems they address and residual risks in the event the recommendations are not implemented.  Guidance is also provided on how to organize management of automated access with the objective of reducing the system administration burden and organization operational cost, and on tools for automating the process.</t></abstract>
