<abstract><t>The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) addresses the needs of operators and application developers to represent multiple types of policy rules. This document defines a single common extensible framework for representing different types of policy rules, in the form of a set of information models, that is independent of language, protocol, repository, and the level of abstraction of the content of the policy rule. This enables a common set of concepts defined in this set of information models to be mapped into different data models that use different languages, protocols, and repositories to optimize their usage. The definition of common policy concepts also provides better interoperability by ensuring that each data model can share a set of common concepts, independent of its level of detail or the language, protocol, and/or repository that it is using.  Specifically, this document defines three information models:</t></abstract>
