<abstract><t>When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object identifiers was donated by DigiCert, Inc. for the purpose of registering the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and signature algorithms.  This donated set of OIDs allowed for shorter values than would be possible using the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.  This document describes the range of identifiers that were assigned in that donated range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that range.</t></abstract>
