<abstract><t>The standard RFC 3775 mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sent by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the use of a pair of unidirectional IPsec security associations between these two nodes.  The standard mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sent by a Mobile Node to one of its Correspondent Nodes relies on the use of a return routability test that involves the Correspondent Node verifying reachability of the Mobile Node at both its Home Address and its Care-of Address.  The mechanism also requires the correspondent node to send keying material to both of these addresses.  RFC 4866 specifies a standard track mecanism that allows a Mobile Node that has configured a Cryptographically Generated Address (RFC 3972) as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sent its Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of its Cryptographically Generated Addresses.  Note that Cryptographically Generated Addresses have also been used to counter similar security issues in the context of SHIM6 (RFC 5533) and Secure Neighbor Discovery (RFC 3971.)  This memo proposes a mechanism that would let a Mobile Node use a similar mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates its sent to its Home Agent with a similar technique based on the use of Cryptographically Generated Addresses.</t></abstract>
