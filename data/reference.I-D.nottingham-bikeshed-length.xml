<abstract><t>The HTTP Content-Length header field is overloaded with (at least) two duties: message delimitation in HTTP/1, and metadata about the length of an incoming request body to the software handling it.  This causes confusion, and sometimes problems.  This document proposes a new header to untangle these semantics (at least partially).</t></abstract>
