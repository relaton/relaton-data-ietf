<abstract><t>Firewall performs resource intensive filtering of traffic based on set of rules. A single firewall becomes a traffic bottleneck depending on network expansion, number of connections and the throughput required. This document describes a method of interconnecting the firewalls at multiple geographic locations through standalone network. It will enable firewall to dedicate its full processing capacity to perform task of packet filtering. The tasks of encryption, dynamic routing and anti-spoofing of traffic are taken care outside firewall function. The placement of firewall and routing device along with protocols to be used will form the proposed system to improve overall network security and scalability.</t></abstract>
