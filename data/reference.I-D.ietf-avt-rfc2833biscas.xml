<abstract><t>This memo updates RFC 4733 to add event codes for telephony signals used for channel-associated signalling when carried in the telephony event RTP payload.  It supersedes and adds to the original assignment of event codes for this purpose in RFC 2833 section 3.14.  As documented in Appendix A of RFC 4733, certain of the RFC 2833 events have been deprecated, because their specification was ambiguous, erroneous or redundant.  In fact, the degree of change from RFC 2833 section 3.14 is such that implementations of the present document will be fully backward compatible with RFC 2833 implementations only in the case of full ABCD-bit signalling.  The positive benefits of the present document are an expanded coverage of signalling systems and a more carefully specified and documented coverage of signalling systems covered by RFC 2833.</t></abstract>
