<abstract><t>A single textual representation for 4-byte Autonomous System (AS) numbers is defined, to avoid any confusion in interpreting the two 2-byte quantities of which it is comprised. The syntax chosen avoids collision with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) community string parsing of AS numbers. It is recommended that only this textual representation be used by all documents and systems referring to 4-byte AS numbers.</t></abstract>
