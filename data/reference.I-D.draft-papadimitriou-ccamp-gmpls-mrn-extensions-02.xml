<abstract><t>Most of the initial efforts on Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) have been related to environments hosting single switching capability devices as such, the complexity raised by the control of such data planes is similar to the one expected in classical IP/MPLS networks. The present document analyses the various GMPLS signaling and routing aspects when considering network environments consisting of multiple switching capabilities as defined in RFC 3945.</t></abstract>
