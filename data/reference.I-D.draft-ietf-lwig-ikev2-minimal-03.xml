<abstract><t>This document describes minimal initiator version of the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol.  IKEv2 is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication and establishing and maintaining Security Associations (SAs).  IKEv2 includes several optional features, which are not needed in minimal implementations. This document describes what is required from the minimal implementation, and also describes various optimizations which can be done.  The protocol described here is compliant with full IKEv2 with exception that this document describes mainly shared secret authentication (IKEv2 requires support for certificate authentication in addition to shared secret authentication).  This minimal initiator implementation can only talk to the IKEv2 implementation which supports also acting as responder, thus two minimal initiator implementations cannot talk to each other.  This document does not update or modify RFC 7296, but provides more compact description of the minimal version of the protocol.  If this document and RFC 7296 conflicts then RFC 7296 is the authoritative description.</t></abstract>
