<abstract><t>Various published proposals for use of the IPv6 flow label are incompatible with its original specification in RFC 3697. Furthermore, very little practical use is made of the flow label, partly due to some uncertainties about the correct interpretation of the specification.  This document discusses and motivates changes to the specification in order to clarify it and to introduce some additional flexibility.  This document is not an Internet Standards  Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
