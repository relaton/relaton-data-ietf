<abstract><t>This document presents a retrieval method YANG Data model for connectionless OAM protocols.  It provides technology-independent RPC operations for OAM protocols that use connectionless communication. The retrieval methods model herein presented can be extended to include technology specific details.  There are two key benefits of this approach: First, it leads to uniformity between OAM protocols. And second, it support both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different or same levels through a unified interface) as well as interactive OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at same levels through a unified interface).</t></abstract>
