<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) is a new MPLS paradigm in which each SR-capable router is required to advertise global MPLS labels or Segment IDs (SID) for its attached prefixes by using link-state IGPs, e.g., OSPF. One major challenge associated with such global MPLS label or SID advertisement mechanism is how to avoid a given global MPLS label or SID from being allocated by different routers to different prefixes. Although such global label or SID allocation collision problem can be addressed through manual allocation , it is error-prone and nonautomatic therefore may not be suitable in large-scale SR network environments.  This document proposes an alternative approach for allocating and advertising global MPLS labels or SIDs via OSPF so as to eliminate the potential risk of label allocation collision.</t></abstract>
