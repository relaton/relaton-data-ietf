<abstract><t>This document specifies a method based on Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) for protecting the IPv6 network from address spoofing.  The basic idea is to define a new IPv6 extension header which is called CGA header.  Three new options of CGA header are introduced to satisfy the need of verification between all CGA-aware nodes.  This document also illustrates the proposed verification procedure under several different situations.  Additionally, a possible alternative way using destination options header to take CGA information is described.</t></abstract>
