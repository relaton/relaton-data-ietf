<abstract><t>Internet Traffic has constantly shown the pattern that a very small amount of the traffic flows generate a high traffic volume while a significant amount of small flows contribute a small amount of traffic volume. Differentiating such large flow and small flow in the packet switched network enables an enhanced transport method over Equal Cost Multi Paths (ECMP). This draft describes the enhanced ECMP transport with the large flow awareness.</t></abstract>
