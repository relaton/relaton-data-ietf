<abstract><t>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops. TRILL supports VLANs and the multi-pathing of both unicast and multicast traffic.  TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) link state routing and encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a hop count. Devices that implement TRILL are called RBridges (Routing Bridges).  The ESADI (End System Address Distribution Information) protocol is a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) scoped way that RBridge can communicate end station addresses to each other.  An RBridge announcing VLAN-x connectivity (normally a VLAN-x forwarder) and running the TRILL ESADI protocol receives remote address information and/or transmits local address information for VLAN-x.  The purpose of this document is to improve the documentation of the ESADI protocol.  The ESADI RBridge instance states, DRB (Designated RBridge) election procedure, and ESADI sub-TLVs are specified in this document.</t></abstract>
