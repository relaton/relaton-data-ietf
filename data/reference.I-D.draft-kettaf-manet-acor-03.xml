<abstract><t>The Admission Control enabled On-demand Routing (ACOR) protocol is intended for use by MANETs.  It is a reactive routing protocol designed to support quality of service (QoS) on the end to end route. ACOR is based on simple local cost functions at each node, and global cost function to represent the end-to-end cost of a route, in addition to a simple admission control mechanism for implicit resource reservation adapted to frequent changing of network topology.</t></abstract>
