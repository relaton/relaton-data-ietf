<abstract><t>This memo introduces new header fields for use in Internet email, to allow the author of a message to specify primary (To) and secondary (Cc) recipients who, in the author's opinion, should not be recipients of a reply to the message. These new fields are designed to be highly compatible with pre-existing mail handling programs, and to facilitate a graceful transition. If this document is favorably received, it is the author's intent to submit this document (as an individual submission) for consideration for Proposed Standard status. Unless IESG directs otherwise, public discussion of this document should be on the ietf-822@imc.org mailing list. Comments may also be sent to the author.</t></abstract>
