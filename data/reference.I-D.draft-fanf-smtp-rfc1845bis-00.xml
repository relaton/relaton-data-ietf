<abstract><t>This memo describes the SMTP service extension for checkpoint/resume, which allows a client to recover from a lost connection to the server without having to repeat all of the commands and message content sent prior to the interruption, and with less risk of duplicated messages. Checkpoint/resume is based on, and fixes a number of problems with, the SMTP service extension for checkpoint/restart [RFC1845].</t></abstract>
