<abstract><t>Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been implemented.  As networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork the information to/from ISDN for end-to-end transparency.  This document discusses the approaches and recommends a new header field User-to-User be standardized.  An example application of an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) in a contact center is given.</t></abstract>
