<abstract><t>The Diffie-Hellman (DH) Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport layer Protocol specifies that servers and clients should support groups with a modulus length of k bits, where the recommended minumum value is 1024 bits.  Recent security research has shown that a minimum value of 1024 bits is insufficient against state-sponsored actors.  As such, this document formally updates RFC 4419 [RFC4419] such that the minimum recommended value for k is 2048 bits and the group size is 2048 bits at minimum.</t></abstract>
