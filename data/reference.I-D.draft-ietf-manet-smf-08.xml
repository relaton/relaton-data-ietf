<abstract><t>This document describes a Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) mechanism that provides basic IP multicast forwarding suitable for wireless mesh and mobile ad hoc network (MANET) use.  SMF specifies techniques for multicast duplicate packet detection (DPD) to assist the forwarding process.  SMF also specifies DPD maintenance and checking operations for with both IPv4 and IPv6.  SMF also specifies the optional use of reduced relay sets for efficient MANET multicast data distribution within a mesh topology.  The document describes interactions with other protocols and multiple deployment approaches. Distributed algorithms for selecting reduced relay sets and related discussion are provided in the Appendices.  Basic issues relating to the operation of multicast MANET border routers are discussed but ongoing work remains in this area beyond the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
