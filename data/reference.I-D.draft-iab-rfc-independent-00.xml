<abstract><t>There is a long-term tradition in the Internet community, predating the IETF by many years, of use of the RFC series to publish materials that are not rooted in the IETF standards process and its review and approval mechanisms. These documents, known as "independent submissions", serve a number of important functions for the Internet community, both inside and outside of the community of active IETF participants. This document discusses the independent submission model and some reasons why it is important. It then describes editorial and processing norms that can be used for independent submissions as the community goes forward into new relationships between the IETF community and its primary technical publisher.</t></abstract>
