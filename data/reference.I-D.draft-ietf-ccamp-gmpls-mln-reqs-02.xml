<abstract><t>Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been related to environments hosting devices with a single switching capability. The complexity raised by the control of such data planes is similar to that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks. By extending MPLS to support multiple switching technologies, GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a multi- layered network of either a single switching technology or multiple switching technologies. In GMPLS, a switching technology domain defines a region, and a network of multiple switching types is referenced in this document as a multi-region network (MRN). When referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of either a single or multiple regions, this document uses the term, Multi-layer Network (MLN). This draft defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region/multi-layer networks and lists a set of functional requirements.</t></abstract>
