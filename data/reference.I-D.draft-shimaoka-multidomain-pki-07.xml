<abstract><t>This memo is intended to describe the foundation necessary to the deployment of a multi-domain PKI. The scope of this memo is to establish and clarify the trust relationships and interoperability between multiple PKI domains. A Certification Authority (CA) is able to extend a certification path by establishing trust with other CAs. Both single- and multi-domain PKIs are established by such trust relationships between CAs. Typical and primitive PKI model is a single-domain PKI that shares the same Certificate Policy (CP) at a specified trust level. A multi-domain PKI is established by combining more than one single-domain PKI. A multi-domain PKI can be categorized as either a multi-trust point model based on the trust list model; or single-trust point model based on the Cross- Certification model.</t></abstract>
