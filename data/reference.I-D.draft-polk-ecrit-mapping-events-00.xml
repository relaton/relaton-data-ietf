<abstract><t>Emergency calling is a localized event, requiring a caller to place an specially identified local emergency call to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), while including the location of the caller in that signaling. The function of routing the set-up messaging to the appropriate PSAP is performed by a mapping function that binds a given location with one or more PSAP SIP(S)-URIs. This function is done by the ECRIT mapping protocol. This document analyzes when the ECRIT mapping protocol function can occur, and what general components are involved in that mapping.</t></abstract>
