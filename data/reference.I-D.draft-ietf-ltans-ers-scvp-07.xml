<abstract><t>The Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) defines an extensible means of delegating the development and validation of certification paths to a server.  It can be used to support the development and validation of certification paths well after the expiration of the certificates in the path by specifying a time of interest in the past.  The Evidence Record Syntax (ERS) defines structures, called evidence records, to support non-repudiation of existence of data.  Evidence records can be used to preserve materials that comprise a certification path such that trust in the certificates can be established after the expiration of the certificates in the path and after the cryptographic algorithms used to sign the certificates in the path are no longer secure.  This document describes usage of the SCVP WantBack feature to convey evidence records, enabling SCVP responders to provide preservation evidence for certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).</t></abstract>
