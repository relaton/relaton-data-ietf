<abstract><t>The base HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol includes options for retrieving location information from a LIS by a Device. Some networks require the ability for the device to periodically request location information from the LIS and/or for the LIS to periodically request location information from the device. Extensions to base HELD allow a Device to establish a context with a LIS and negotiate capabilities of the Device in terms of providing location information.  The measurement extensions to base HELD allow the LIS to request location information from a Device.  This document provides an overview of the requirements and a solution using HELD and HELD extensions to support the periodic request of location information, both by a Device from an LIS and by the LIS from a Device, depending upon the specific scenario and measurement capabilities of the Device.</t></abstract>
