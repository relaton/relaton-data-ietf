<abstract><t>This document tries to propose an architectural framework of the internet in the real IP world. It shows how to reorganize the provider network with a large address space. It describes how a three-tier mesh structured hierarchy can be established based on fragmenting the entire space into some regions and some sub regions inside each of them. It addresses issues which could be relevant to this architecture in the context of IPv6.</t></abstract>
