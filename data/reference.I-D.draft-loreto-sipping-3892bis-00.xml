<abstract><t>SIP has a mechanism for conveying the asserted identity of the originator of a request by means of the P-Asserted-Identity header field.  When exploding a SIP MESSAGE request to a pre-defined group URI and when exploding a SIP INVITE request to an ad-hoc group or to a pre-defined group URI, the Referred-By header field in the resulting exploded requests is set to the P-Asserted-Identity header field or to the From header field.  The Referred-By header is only included if the P-Asserted-Identity header field or From header field needs to carry another value, e.g. the URI of a pre-defined group, or a conference focus URI.  Since the P-Asserted-Identity header field may carry up to two values, the Referred-By definition needs to be extended to allow up to two values as well.</t></abstract>
