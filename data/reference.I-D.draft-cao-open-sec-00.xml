<abstract><t>This position paper introduces an architecture of opening the operator's security capability to third party smart object applications.  With this architecture, the authentication, integrity and encryption capabilities can be wrapped up as Application Programming Interfaces and provided to third party application developers.  So the third party applications do not have to spare energy on these basic security functionalities.  As a consequence, the barrier for new applications is lowered, and it avoids the need of providing security by multiple applications and hence saves the computing and communication resources on constrained nodes.  Note: This document is submitted for the IAB Workshop on Smart Object Security on March 23, 2012, Paris.</t></abstract>
