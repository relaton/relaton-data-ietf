<abstract><t>RFC 5492 defines capabilities advertisement for the BGP peer.  In addition, it's useful to know the capabilities of the BGP Next-Hop, in particular for forwarding plane features.  RFC 5492 is not applicable because the BGP peer may be different from the BGP Next- Hop, in particular when BGP Route Reflection is used.  This document defines a mechanism to advertise such BGP Next Hop Capabilities.  This document defines a new BGP non-transitive attribute to carry Next-Hop Capabilities.  This attribute is deleted when the BGP Next Hop is changed.  This document also defines a Next-Hop capability to advertise the ability to handle the Entropy Label defined in RFC 6790.</t></abstract>
