<abstract><t>This document proposes a new type of response for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) called a "Pending" response.  A CoAP server can use a Pending response to indicate that it has accepted a request but has not yet started processing it or that processing the request will take longer than a client is typically willing to wait for a response.</t></abstract>
