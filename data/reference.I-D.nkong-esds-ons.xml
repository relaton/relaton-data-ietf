<abstract><t>Object Naming Service (ONS) is a network service that leverages Domain Name System (DNS) to discover information about a product and related services from the Electronic Product Code (EPC).  Extensible Supply-chain Discovery Service (ESDS) is an application layer protocol for the distributed sharing and discovery of notification events between associated partners within a supply chain.  Unlike DNS or ONS, where there is a known set of root servers, ESDS will have numerous roots for various supply chains operating globally.  ONS can be used in collaboration with ESDS to make the multiple ESDS roots be found easily.  This document is intended to extend the ONS to support ESDS by defining a new Naming Authority PoinTeR (NAPTR) service type of ONS for ESDS.</t></abstract>
