<abstract><t>Network Function Virtualization (NFV), conceptualized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) NFV Industry Specification Group (ISG) , is gaining significant momentum within the the telecoms industry.  A key area currently being discussed within the ETSI NFV ISG is the reliability and availability of the network service implemented by a set of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) building on top of the virtualization infrastructure.  This document mainly focus on problem statement and gap analysis.  It provides an overview of the problem space related to NFV reliability, it then briefly reviews an applicable architecture to scope potential solution space.  Finally it identifies the gaps of several existing approaches to NFV reliability for potential reuse and extension.</t></abstract>
