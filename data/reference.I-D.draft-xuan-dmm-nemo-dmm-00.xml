<abstract><t>Network mobility (NEMO) provides session continuity for mobile nodes (MN) while moving in vehicles without their involvement in signaling process. NEMO Basic support protocol [RFC3963] is standardized to provide network mobility support.  Current mobility management protocols, such as MIPv6 [RFC6275] and PMIPv6 [RFC5213], rely on a central mobility anchor in order to provide mobility support for the mobile nodes. These centralized approaches show some big issues, such as a single point of failure, non-optimal routing, and scalability. Ever-increasing demand for the mobile traffic changes the network architecture from hierarchical to flat architecture, and distributed mobility management (DMM) approaches are being researched to adapt the new flat architecture and overcome big above issues.  This document presents about detailed protocol operation to support network mobility in the DMM domain.</t></abstract>
