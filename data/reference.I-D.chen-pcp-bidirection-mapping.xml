<abstract><t>The memo has proposed a bi-directional option, along with which PCP could not only control PCP client pinhole, but also could manage port mapping status for communicating remote peers.  The bi-directional port control mode will eliminate risks of connections interruption caused by remote peer pinhole timeout.</t></abstract>
