<abstract><t>The use of Internet technologies for emergency calling creates opportunities for fraud, relative to traditional circuit-switched emergency calling.  This document describes the context for IP-based emergency calling, and the types of fraud which are possible within the system.  A mitigation strategy for fraud against voice service providers is described; techniques for detecting or preventing other types of fraud will be incorporated in this document as they are available.</t></abstract>
