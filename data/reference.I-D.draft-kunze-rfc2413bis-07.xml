<abstract><t>The Dublin Core Metadata Workshop Series began in 1995 with an invitational workshop which brought together librarians, digital library researchers, content experts, and text-markup experts to promote better discovery standards for electronic resources. The resulting metadata element set defines fifteen metadata elements for resource description in a cross-disciplinary information environment. This document contains the current text of Dublin Core "Version 1.1". Version 1.1 is the basis of ANSI/NISO Z39.85-2001 [Z39.85]. The text in the present RFC closely follows the text in the 2007 revision of ANSI/NISO Z39.85, especially sections 2-6 and 10-12. The present RFC obsoletes the Internet RFC 2413 [RFC2413], which was the first published version of the Dublin Core ("Version 1.0"). The main differences between the present RFC and RFC 2413 are in the wording of definitions -- for Contributor and Date (semantically broadened), for Relation (clarified), and in general removing redundant references to "the content of" a resource. In addition, the present RFC recommends lowercase element names (consistent with RDF property types), remains silent about the unrestrictedness of element ordering and repeatability (application profiles being the proper place to discuss such topics), and references the current abstract model, vocabularies, and namespace policies in which the Dublin Core is embedded.</t></abstract>
