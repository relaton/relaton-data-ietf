<abstract><t>This document provides guidance of IoT architecture based on virtual thing environment for security. In the heterogeneous IoT environment, Internet of Things(IoT) have a limitation in adapting management function such as updating software, adopting various general cryptography mechanisms since they have limited processing power, storage space and transmission capacities. Moreover, IoT could not support all of requirement for IoT management function in heterogeneous environment. Especially, security is one of the issue in heterogeneous environments. Therefore, this draft describes IoT architecture based on virtual thing environment and classify the requirements as well as problem statement.</t></abstract>
