<abstract><t>The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a rapidly configurable multi-hop wireless network without an infrastructure and originally proposed for the military use. In order to make the MANET a more commonly used network in our daily lives, it may be necessary to connect the MANET to the global Internet. A MANET node can communicate with an Internet node via the Internet gateway. To support fault tolerance and increase the bandwidth, multiple Internet gateways can be deployed within a MANET and, in this case, the network performance can be improved by balancing the load among Internet gateways. In this draft, we propose load-balancing Internet gateway selection mechanisms for the MANET with multiple stationary Internet gateways. In addition to this, we propose a scheme that reduces the routing control message overhead in the MANET.</t></abstract>
