<abstract><t>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a remote host.  One of its primary uses is the booting of diskless nodes on a Local Area Network.  TFTP is used because it is very simple to implement in a small node's limited ROM space.  However, the choice of a lock-step schema is not the most efficient for use on a LAN.  This document describes a TFTP option which allows the client and server to negotiate a windowsize of consecutive blocks to send as an alternative for replacing the lock-step single block schema. The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is described in [2].</t></abstract>
