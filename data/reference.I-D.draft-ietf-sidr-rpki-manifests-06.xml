<abstract><t>This document defines a "manifest" for use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure.  A manifest is a signed object that contains a listing of all the signed objects in the repository publication point associated with an authority responsible for publishing in the repository.  For each certificate, CRL, or other type of signed objects issued by the authority that are published at this repository publication point, the manifest contains both the name of the file containing the object, and a hash of the file content.  Manifests are intended to enable a relying party to detect certain forms of attacks against a repository.  Specifically, a relying party that checks a manifest against the signed objects retrieved from a repository publication point can detect "stale" (valid) data and deletion of signed objects.</t></abstract>
