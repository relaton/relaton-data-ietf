<abstract><t>Pipelining was added to HTTP/1.1 as a means of improving the performance of persistent connections in common cases.  While it is deployed in some limited circumstances, it is not widely used by clients on the open Internet.  This memo suggests some measures designed to make it more possible for clients to reliably and safely use HTTP pipelining in these situations.  This memo should be discussed on the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list, although it is not a work item of the HTTPbis WG.</t></abstract>
