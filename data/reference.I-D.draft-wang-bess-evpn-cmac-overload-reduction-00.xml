<abstract><t>When there are too many customer-MACs (C-MACs), the RRs and/or ASBRs will be overloaded by the RT-2 routes for these MACs according to [I-D.dawra-bess-srv6-services].  This issue can be simply solved by making the remote C-MAC entries learnt via data-plane MAC learning (like what PBB VPLS have been done since [RFC7041]) rather than received from RT-2 routes.  This simplified solution will works as well as PBB VPLS.  But this simplified solution will lose many important features that based on the ESI concept.  Because the ingress-ESI can't be learnt via data-plane MAC learning at the egress PE.  So when the data packets is forwarded following these MAC entries, they can't benefit from the EAD/EVI routes as per RFC7432. So the All-Active Redundancy mode for ES can't be supported.  This make the simplified solution can't work as well as PBB EVPN ([RFC7623]).  This document proposes a new SRv6 function type and an extension to [I-D.dawra-bess-srv6-services] to achieve all-active mode ES redundancy on TPEs and reduce the C-MAC loads for RRs and ASBRs.  The new solution will work even more better than PBB EVPN under the help of these extensions.</t></abstract>
