<abstract><t>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is widely deployed to monitor, control and configure network elements. Even though the SNMP technology is well documented, it remains relatively unclear how SNMP is used in practice and what typical SNMP usage patterns are. This document proposes to carry out large scale SNMP traffic measurements in order to develop a better understanding how SNMP is used in real world production networks. It describes the motivation, the measurement approach, and the tools and data formats needed to carry out such a study.</t></abstract>
