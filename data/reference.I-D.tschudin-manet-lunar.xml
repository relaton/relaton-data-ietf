<abstract><t>The Lightweight Underlay Network Ad hoc Routing (LUNAR) Protocol is intended for use by mobile nodes in small size wireless ad hoc networks. LUNAR operates at layer 2.5. It emulates a single-hop IP subnet with unicast as well as broadcast communication primitives. DHCP and ARP messages are intercepted and serve as hooks for self- configuration of IP addresses as well as the mapping of IP addresses to the underlying layer 2.5 multihop routes.</t></abstract>
