<abstract><t>This document describes the "Bump-In-the-Host" (BIH), a host based IPv4 to IPv6 protocol translation mechanism that allows a subset of applications supporting only IPv4 to communicate with peers that are reachable only with IPv6.  A host may be connected to IPv6-only or dual-stack access network.  Essentially BIH makes the IPv4 applications think they talk to IPv4 peers and hence hides the existence of IPv6 from those applications.  Acknowledgement of previous work  This document is an update to and directly derivative from Kazuaki TSHUCHIYA, Hidemitsu HIGUCHI, and Yoshifumi ATARASHI [RFC2767] and from Seungyun Lee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin Kim, Alain Durand, and Erik Nordmark's [RFC3338], which similarly provides a dual stack host means to communicate with other IPv6 host using existing IPv4 appliations.  This document combines and updates both [RFC2767] and [RFC3338].  The changes in this document reflect five components  1.  Supporting IPv6 only network connections  2.  IPv4 address pool use private address instead of the  unassigned IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.1 - 0.0.0.255)  3.  Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently  4.  Adding an alternative way to implement the ENR  5.  Going for standards track instead of experimental/  informational</t></abstract>
