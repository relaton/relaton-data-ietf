<abstract><t>This document discusses the motivation and requirements for supporting interactive network queries and data collection through a mechanism called Dynamic Network Probes (DNP).  Network applications and OAM have various data requirements from the data plane.  The unpredictable and interactive nature of the query for network data analytics asks for dynamic and on-demand data collection capabilities.  As user programmable data plane is becoming a reality, it can be enhanced to support interactive query through DNPs.  DNP supports node, path, and flow-based data preprocessing and collection.  For example, in-situ OAM (iOAM) with user-defined flow- based data collection can be programmed and configured through DNP. DNPs serve as a building block of an integrated network data telemetry and analytics platform which involves the network data plane as an active component for user-defined data collection and preparation.</t></abstract>
