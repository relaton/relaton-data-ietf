<abstract><t>This document describes several NAT traversal techniques that could be used by RTSP.  Each technique includes a description on how it would be used, the security implications of using it and any other deployment considerations it has.  There are also disussions on how NAT traversal techniques relates to firewalls and how each technique can be applied in different use cases.  These findings where used when selecting the NAT traversal for RTSP solution to standardize in the MMUSIC WG.</t></abstract>
