<abstract><t>The IETF intends to provide a new tool to Area Directors for the creation, re-chartering, and closing of Working Groups.  The tool will also allow the IETF community to view the status of the chartering process.  This document describes the requirements for the proposed new tool, and it is intended as input to a later activity for the design and development of such a tool.</t></abstract>
