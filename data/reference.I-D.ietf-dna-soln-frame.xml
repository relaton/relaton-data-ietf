<abstract><t>This draft captures the authors' opinions and is intended to serve as input to the discussion for the solution in the DNA WG. It presents a few assumptions for DNA solution. The draft proposes the solution to be based on 1) link identity, 2) RS/RA exchange formed so that a host can determine whether it has moved from a single RA, and 3) Quick delivery of an RA. The draft sketches what rough shape DNA solution could take, including the necessary interaction with Duplicate Address Detection and the Multicast Listener Discovery protocol. It also enumerate a few tasks to be worked on and issues to be resolved for efficient DNA solution.</t></abstract>
