<abstract><t>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network diagnostics by providers and users, as well as for public policy.  To conduct such measurements, user networks gather data instructed by a measurement controller, and then upload the measurement results to a designated measurement server. Understanding the various scenarios and users of measuring broadband performance is essential to development of the framework, information model and protocol.  The details of the measurement metrics themselves are beyond the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
