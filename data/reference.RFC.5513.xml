<title>IANA Considerations for Three Letter Acronyms</title>

<abstract><t>Three Letter Acronyms (TLAs) are commonly used to identify components of networks or protocols as designed or specified within the IETF.  A common concern is that one acronym may have multiple expansions. While this may not have been an issue in the past, network convergence means that protocols that did not previously operate together are now found in close proximity.  This results in contention for acronyms, and confusion in interpretation.  Such confusion has the potential to degrade the performance of the Internet as misunderstandings lead to misconfiguration or other operating errors.</t><t>Given the growing use of TLAs and the relatively small number available, this document specifies a Badly Construed Proposal (BCP) for the management of a registry of TLAs within the IETF, and the procedures for the allocation of new TLAs from the registry.  This memo provides  information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
