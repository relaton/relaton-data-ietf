<abstract><t>The IETF working group on Source Address Validation Improvements, SAVI, is chartered to design methods for IP source address validation that complement ingress filtering with finer-grained protection. This document summarizes the discussion in the SAVI working group and design-related conclusions.  The purpose of this is two-fold:  First, to guide the design process in the working group with written documentation of decisions and their rationale.  Second, to provide a measure for assessing the IP source address validation methods that the working group will eventually deliver.</t></abstract>
