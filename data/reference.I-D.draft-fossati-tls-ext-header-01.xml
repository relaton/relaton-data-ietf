<abstract><t>This document proposes a mechanism to extend the record header in DTLS.  To that aim, the DTLS header is modified as follows: the length field is trimmed to 15 bits, and the length's top bit is given the "record header extension indicator" semantics, allowing a sender to signal that one or more record header extensions have been added to this record.  We define the generic format of a record header extension and the general rules associated with its handling.  Any details regarding syntax, semantics and negotiation of a specific record header extension, are left to future documents.</t></abstract>
