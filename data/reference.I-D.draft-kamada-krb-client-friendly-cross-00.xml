<abstract><t>This document proposes a cross-realm transition model, which is friendly to resource-limited clients. This model provides a way to move the cost of consecutive Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) exchanges from the clients to the KDC and a way to reduce the transition cost by generating a direct inter-realm relationship between two realms. The document itself does not specify any protocols, which need to be specified separately.</t></abstract>
