<abstract><t>Software Defined Networks (SDN) provides a way to virtualize and abstract the network and present the virtual or abstract resources to third-party applications running in software.  Applications can utilize a programmable interface to receive these virtual or abstract resources descriptions in a form that allows monitoring or manipulation of resources within the network.  The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) provides an interface directly to the routing System to monitor best paths to any destination or change routes in the routing information base (RIB) or MPLS Label Information Base (LIB).  The I2RS interfaces may be combined with other interfaces to the forwarding plane (OpenFlow, ForCES (RFC3746)), device configuration (NETCONF), or mid-level (peer-to-peer) (ALTO) system to create these virtual pathways.  This document outlines how SDN networks can use the I2RS interface to implement an automated set of network services for the Virtual Connection on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD). These systems provide service routing a better way to create paths within a hub and spoke environment, and provide service routing the ability to create pathways based on service.</t></abstract>
