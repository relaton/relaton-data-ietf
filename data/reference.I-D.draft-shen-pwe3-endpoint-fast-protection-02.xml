<abstract><t>This document specifies a fast protection mechanism for pseudowires (PWs) against egress attachment circuit failure, egress PE failure (including multi-segment PW terminating PE failure), and multi- segment PW switching PE failure.  Designed on the basis of multi- homed CE, PW redundancy, upstream label assignment and context specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair to be performed by a router adjacent to a failure.  In particular, the router can restore PW traffic in the order of tens of milliseconds, by transmitting the traffic to a protector through a pre-established bypass tunnel.  Therefore, the mechanism is usable to reduce the packet loss that may happen before any global repair mechanism reacts to the failure or routers converge on the topology changes due to the failure.</t></abstract>
