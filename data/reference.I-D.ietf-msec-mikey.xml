<abstract><t>Security protocols for real-time multimedia applications have started to appear. This has brought forward the need for a key management solution to support these protocols. This document describes a key management scheme that can be used for real-time applications (both for peer-to-peer communication and group communication), and shows how it may work together with protocols such as SIP and RTSP. In particular, its use to support the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol, [SRTP], is described in detail.</t></abstract>
