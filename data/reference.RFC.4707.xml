<abstract><t>The Netnews Administration System (NAS) is a framework to simplify the administration and usage of network news (also known as Netnews) on the Internet.  Data for the administration of newsgroups and hierarchies are kept in a distributed hierarchical database and are available through a client-server protocol.</t><t>The database is accessible by news servers, news administrators, and news readers.  News servers can update their configuration automatically; administrators are able to get the data manually.  News reader programs are able to get certain information from an NAS server, automatically or at a user's discretion, which provides detailed information about groups and hierarchies to the user.</t><t>NAS is usable in coexistence with the current, established process of control messages; an unwanted interference is impossible. Furthermore, NAS is able to reflect the somewhat chaotic structure of Usenet in a hierarchical database.  NAS can be used without modification of existing news relay, news server, or news reader software; however, some tasks will be better accomplished with NAS-compliant software.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
