<abstract><t>The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) denotes a trend where a large number of embedded devices employ communication services offered by the Internet protocols.  Many of these devices, often called "smart objects" are not directly operated by humans, but exist as components in buildings or vehicles, or are spread out in the environment. Following the theme "Everything that can be connected will be connected", engineers and researchers designing smart object networks need to decide how to achieve this in practice.  This document offers guidance to engineers designing Internet connected smart objects.</t></abstract>
