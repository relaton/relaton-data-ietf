<abstract><t>This draft recommends protocol updates to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) status code 451 (defined by RFC7725) based on an examination of how the new status code is being used by parties involved in denial of Internet resources because of legal demands.  Also included is an analysis of HTTP 451 from a human rights perspective using guidelines from RFC8280.  Discussion of this draft is at https://www.irtf.org/mailman/listinfo/ hrpc and https://lists.ghserv.net/mailman/listinfo/statuscode451.</t></abstract>
