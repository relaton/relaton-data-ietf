<abstract><t>In certain networks like financial information network (stock/ commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications, Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet Loss is becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service providers.  [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and ISIS respectively.  The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.  This document describes the extension to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as constraints for end to end path computation.</t></abstract>
