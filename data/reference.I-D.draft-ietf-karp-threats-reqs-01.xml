<abstract><t>Different routing protocols exist and each employs its own mechanism for securing the protocol packets on the wire.  While most already have some method for accomplishing cryptographic message authentication, in many cases the existing methods are dated, vulnerable to attack, and employ cryptographic algorithms that have been deprecated.  The "Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols" (KARP) effort aims to overhaul and improve these mechanisms.  This document has two main parts - the first describes the threat analysis for attacks against routing protocols' transports and the second enumerates the requirements for addressing the described threats.  This document, along with the KARP design guide and KARP framework documents, will be used by KARP design teams for specific protocol review and overhaul.  This document reflects the input of both the IETF's Security Area and Routing Area in order to form a jointly agreed upon guidance.</t></abstract>
