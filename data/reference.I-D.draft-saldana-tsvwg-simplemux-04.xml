<abstract><t>The low efficiency caused by the high amount of small packets present in the network can be alleviated by means of packet aggregation. There are some situations in which multiplexing a number of small packets into a bigger one is desirable.  For example, a number of small packets can be sent together between a pair of machines if they share a common network path.  Thus, the traffic profile can be shifted from small to larger packets, reducing the network overhead and the number of packets per second to be managed by intermediate routers.  This document describes Simplemux, a protocol able to encapsulate a number of packets belonging to different protocols into a single packet.  It includes the "Protocol" field on each multiplexing header, thus allowing the inclusion of a number of packets belonging to different protocols (multiplexed packets) on a packet of another protocol (tunneling protocol).  In order to reduce the overhead, the size of the multiplexing headers is kept very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing small packets).</t></abstract>
