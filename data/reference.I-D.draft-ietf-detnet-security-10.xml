<abstract><t>A DetNet (deterministic network) provides specific performance guarantees to its data flows, such as extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency.  As a result, securing a DetNet implies that in addition to the best practice security measures taken for any mission-critical network, additional security measures may be needed whose purpose is exclusively to secure the intended operation of these novel service properties.  Designers of DetNet components (such as routers) that provide these unique DetNet properties have the responsibility to uphold certain security-related properties that can be assumed by DetNet system- level designers.  For example, the assumption that network traffic associated with a given flow can never affect traffic associated with a different flow is only true if the underlying components make it so.  This document addresses DetNet-specific security considerations from the perspective of both the DetNet component designer and the DetNet system-level designer.  It is assumed that both classes of reader are already familiar with network security best practices for the data plane technologies underlying a given DetNet implementation. Component-level considerations include isolation of data flows from each other, ingress filtering, and detection and reporting of packet arrival time violations.  System-level considerations include a threat model and a taxonomy of relevant attacks, including their potential impacts and mitigations.  A given DetNet may require securing only certain aspects of DetNet performance, for example extremely low data loss rates but not necessarily bounded latency.  Therefore this document provides an association of threats against various use cases by industry, and also against the individual service properties as defined in the DetNet Use Cases.  This document also addresses common DetNet security considerations related to the IP and MPLS data plane technologies (the first to be identified as supported by DetNet), thereby complementing the Security Considerations sections of the various DetNet Data Plane (and other) DetNet documents.</t></abstract>
