<abstract><t>The draft "MPLS Tunnels for Virtual Aggregation" [I-D.ietf-grow-va-mpls] specifies how MPLS is used as the tunneling protocol for Virtual Aggregation (VA).  The -00 version of that draft specifies only one level of labels, with the result that one Label Switched Path (LSP) for every remote ASBR must be established.  For large ISPs, this can amount to a large number of LSPs.  This draft proposes adding the option of using an inner label to identify the remote ASBR.  Either an outer label or an IP tunnel is used to reach the local ASBR.  When MPLS is used as the tunneling protocol, this reduces the number of LSPs to the number of local border routers (ASBR).</t></abstract>
