<abstract><t>This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion issue through the use of an existing Option mechanism that is part of the original IPv4 protocol. This proposal, named EzIP (phonetic for Easy IPv4), outlines the IPv4 public address pool expansion and the Internet system architecture enhancement considerations. EzIP may expand an IPv4 address by a factor of 256M without affecting the existing IPv4 based Internet, or the current private networks. It is in full conformance with the IPv4 protocol, and supports not only both direct and private network connectivity, but also their interoperability. EzIP deployments may coexist with existing Internet traffic and the IoT (Internet of Things) operations without perturbing their setups, while offering end-users the freedom to indepdently choose which service. EzIP may be implemented as a software or firmware enhancement to Internet edge routers or private network routing gateways, wherever needed, or simply installed as an inline adjunct hardware module between the two, enabling a seamless introduction. The 256M case detailed here establishes a complete spherical layer of routers for interfacing between the Internet fabic (core plus edge routers) and the end user premises. Incorporating caching proxy technology in the gateway, a fairly large geographical region may enjoy address expansion based on as little as one ordinary IPv4 public address utilizing IP packets with degenerated EzIP header. If IPv4 public pool allocations were reorganized, the assignable pool could be multiplied 512M fold or even more. EzIP will immediately resolve local IPv4 address shortages, while being transparent to the rest of the Internet. Under the Dual-Stack environment, these proposed interim facilities will relieve the IPv4 address shortage issue, while affording IPv6 more time to reach maturity and to provide the availability levels required for delivering a long-term general service.</t></abstract>
