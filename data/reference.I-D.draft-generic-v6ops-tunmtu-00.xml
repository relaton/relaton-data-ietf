<abstract><t>The IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel MTU as defined by "Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6" is currently recommended to be set to 1480 or less when static MTU determination is used.  This is to avoid IPv4 fragmentation within the tunnel, but requires the tunnel ingress to drop any IPv6 packet larger than 1480 bytes and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message.  Concerns for operational issues with both IPv4 and IPv6 Path MTU Discovery point to the possibility of MTU-related black holes when a packet is dropped due to an MTU restriction.  Fortunately, the "Internet cell size" is 1500 bytes, i.e., the minimum MTU configured by the vast majority of links in the Internet.  This document therefore presents a method to boost the tunnel MTU to 1500 bytes.</t></abstract>
