<abstract><t>This document specifies certificate Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST).  EST is a certificate enrollment over HTTPS protocol that is trivially accessible by modern clients.  The CMC "Simple PKI Messages" and simple certificate responses are leveraged and EST is designed to be easily implemented by clients and servers running other common enrollment mechanisms such as SCEP.  Renewal and rekey mechanisms are described consistent with CMP.</t></abstract>
