<abstract><t>Each Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) router in a PIM domain that supports Any Source Multicast (ASM) maintains Group-to-RP mappings that are used to identify a Rendezvous Point (RP) for a specific multicast group.  PIM-SM has defined an algorithm to choose a RP from the Group-to-RP mappings learned using various mechanisms.  This algorithm does not consider the PIM mode and the mechanism through which a Group-to-RP mapping was learned.</t><t>This document defines a standard algorithm to deterministically choose between several Group-to-RP mappings for a specific group. This document first explains the requirements to extend the Group-to-RP mapping algorithm and then proposes the new algorithm.   [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
