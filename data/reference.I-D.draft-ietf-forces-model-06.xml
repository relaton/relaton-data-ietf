<abstract><t>This document defines the forwarding element (FE) model used in the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol. The model represents the capabilities, state and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of the ForCES protocol, so that control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly. More specifically, the model describes the logical functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are or can be interconnected. This FE model is intended to satisfy the model requirements specified in the ForCES requirements draft, RFC 3564 [1]. A list of the basic logical functional blocks (LFBs) is also defined in the LFB class library to aid the effort in defining individual LFBs.</t></abstract>
