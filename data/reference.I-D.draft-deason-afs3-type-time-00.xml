<abstract><t>This document defines two types to be used in future AFS-3 Rx Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to represent time.  Current AFS-3 RPCs represent time as 32-bit integers representing seconds.  This is insufficient in both granularity and range, so new types to represent time are defined in this document to overcome these limitations.  Internet Draft Comments  Comments regarding this draft are solicited.  Please include the AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments.</t></abstract>
