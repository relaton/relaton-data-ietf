<abstract><t>The working group NSIS (Next Step In Signaling) is created to define a new signaling protocol. This signaling protocol will be generic and applicable to the most of present and future signaling applications. Some of these signaling applications are resource reservation, communication protocol for middlebox, VPN, etc. The intention of NSIS is to re-use, where appropriate, the protocol mechanisms of RSVP while at the same time simplifying it and applying a more general signaling model. NSIS signaling protocol is composed of two layers. NTLP (NSIS Transport Layer Protocol) layer is responsible for transporting signaling messages. NSLP (NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol) is the upper layer that contains functionality such as message formats and sequences, specific to a particular signaling application. NSIS signaling protocol is composed of two layers. NTLP (NSIS Transport Layer Protocol) layer is responsible for transporting signaling messages. NSLP (NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol) is the upper layer which contains functionality such as message formats and sequences, specific to a particular signaling application. This document outlines the proposal of implementation for NTLP which can satisfy the requirements defined in the NSIS working group.</t></abstract>
