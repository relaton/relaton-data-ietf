<abstract><t>In many deployment configurations, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) clients are capable of initiating connection requests towards their SIP server, but the SIP server cannot open connections towards the client. Specifications have been developed which allow for a client- initiated connection to be used for incoming requests towards the client. This outbound connection involves the use of a SIP proxy, called an outbound proxy, that the client connects to. However, the specification does not provide a means to discover the outbound proxy, nor does it support high availability for failures of the outbound proxy mid-dialog. This specification fills those gaps. The resulting mechanism additionally provides solutions for inter-proxy connection reuse and usage of certificates with SIP.</t></abstract>
