<abstract><t>Some MPLS labels have been allocated for specific purposes.  A block of labels (0-15) has been set aside to this end; these labels are commonly called &quot;reserved labels&quot;.  They will be called &quot;special-purpose                       labels&quot; in this document.</t><t>As there are only 16 of these special-purpose labels, caution is needed in the allocation of new special-purpose labels; yet, at the same time, forward progress should be allowed when one is called for.</t><t>This memo defines new procedures for the allocation and retirement of special-purpose labels, as well as a method to extend the special-purpose label space and a description of how to handle extended special-purpose labels in the data plane. Finally, this memo renames the IANA registry for special-purpose labels to &quot;Special-Purpose MPLS Label Values&quot; and creates a new registry called the &quot;Extended Special-Purpose MPLS Label                Values&quot; registry.</t><t>This document updates a number of previous RFCs that use the term &quot;reserved label&quot;.  Specifically, this document updates RFCs 3032, 3038, 3209, 3811, 4182, 4928, 5331, 5586, 5921, 5960, 6391, 6478, and 6790.</t></abstract>
