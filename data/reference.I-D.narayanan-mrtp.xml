<abstract><t>Multimedia data transport over ad hoc networks is a challenging problem. The dynamic nature of the underlying routing and the highly varying quality of the wireless communication links present additional hurdles for the transport of real-time traffic between hosts. However, the mesh topology of ad hoc networks implies the existence of multiple paths between any two nodes. It has been shown in the literature that path diversity provides an effective means of combating transmission errors and topology changes that are typical in ad hoc networks. Moreover, data partitioning techniques, such as striping and thinning, have been demonstrated to improve the queuing performance of real-time data. Recognizing the advantages of these techniques, as well as the increasing need for video services in ad hoc networks, we propose a new transport protocol to support multipath transport of real-time data. The new protocol, called Multi-flow Real-time Transport Protocol (MRTP), provides a convenient vehicle for real-time multimedia applications to partition and to transmit data using multiple flows. Even though the basic idea of MRTP is presented in the context of ad hoc networks, the benefits demonstrated by the use of MRTP is equally applicable to other types of IP network providing multi-media streaming services including the Internet.</t></abstract>
