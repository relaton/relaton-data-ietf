<abstract><t>This document describes the use of TLS to provide privacy for DNS. Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS queries in the network, such as discussed in [RFC7258].  In addition, this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS-over-TLS and provides advice on performance considerations to minimize overhead from using TCP and TLS with DNS.  This document focuses on securing stub-to-recursive traffic, as per the charter of the DPRIVE working group.  It does not prevent future applications of the protocol to recursive-to-authoritative traffic.  Note: this document was formerly named draft-ietf-dprive-start-tls-for-dns.  Its name has been changed to better describe the mechanism now used.  Please refer to working group archives under the former name for history and previous discussion.
