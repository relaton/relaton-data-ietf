<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 in route optimization mode reveals mobile node's care-of address to the correspondent node and hence cannot provide location privacy. In contrast, Mobile IPv6 in bi-directional tunneling mode can provide location privacy, but the resulting route may be far from optimal, especially when correspondent node is mobile as well. This may be an issue for conversational mobile-to-mobile communication scenarios, e.g., using VoIP. The draft discusses the problem of providing both location privacy and route optimization with Mobile IPv6 and describes a solution in terms of an optional extension to Mobile IPv6. The basic idea is that mobile nodes switch the reverse tunnel endpoint in bi-directional tunneling mode from their home agent to a so-called tunneling agent in an on-demand manner. To ensure location privacy, the tunneling agent selection is done by the home agents. The solution does not require the mobile node to change its home address and does not rely on visited network support.</t></abstract>
