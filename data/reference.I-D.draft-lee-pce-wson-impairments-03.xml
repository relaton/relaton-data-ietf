<abstract><t>As an optical signal progresses along its path it may be altered by the various physical processes in the optical fibers and devices it encounters. When such alterations result in signal degradation, these processes are usually referred to as "impairments". These physical characteristics may be important constraints to consider in path computation process in wavelength switched optical networks.  This document provides PCEP extensions to support Impairment Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in wavelength switched optical networks.</t></abstract>
