<abstract><t>The Sieve Email Filtering &quot;include&quot; extension permits users to include one Sieve script inside another.  This can make managing large scripts or multiple sets of scripts much easier, and allows a site and its users to build up libraries of scripts.  Users are able to include their own personal scripts or site-wide scripts.   [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
