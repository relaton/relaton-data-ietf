<abstract><t>The IETF 6LoWPAN working group was formed in 2004 to address the challenge of enabling wireless IPv6 communication over the newly standardized IEEE 802.15.4 low-power radio for devices with limited space, power and memory, such as sensor nodes [3].  IEEE 802.15.4 radio links, coupled with the interoperability and ubiquity of IP, will lead to exciting new deployment scenarios for these low-power networks.  Sensor wireless networks will be integrated into wired and/or wireless fixed infrastructure.  The integration of these sensor networks with the Internet and wireless infrastructure networks increases the network capacity, coverage area and application domains.  In this draft we provide various integration scenarios and discuss associated issues with such deployments.</t></abstract>
