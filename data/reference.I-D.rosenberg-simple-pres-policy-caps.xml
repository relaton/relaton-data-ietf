<abstract><t>An important component of presence services is policy. Policy systems allow the presentity to grant access to specific pieces of information to specific watchers. To allow for interoperability between clients which set such policies, and servers which execute them, it is necessary for clients to be able to determine the capabilities of the server to which it is connected. This specification defines a set of Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements for expressing presence policy capabilities.</t></abstract>
