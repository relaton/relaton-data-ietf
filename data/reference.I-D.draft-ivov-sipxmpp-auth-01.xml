<abstract><t>This document discusses several mechanisms for simplifying authentication of dual-stack SIP+XMPP clients against the corresponding SIP and XMPP services.  The text is not attempt to define a complex credential sharing protocol but rather to determine and eventually encourage use of a simple mechanism that would allow service providers to host a SIP+XMPP solution appearing as a single service to their users.  In other words, the goal here is to agree on a set of recommendations that would encourage client developers to implement simple UIs that would only require users to provide an ID and a password when configuring their SIP+XMPP account for the first time (as opposed to having to do so separately for SIP and XMPP).</t></abstract>
