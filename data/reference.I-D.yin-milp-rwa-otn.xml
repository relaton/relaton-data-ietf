<abstract><t>The RWA problem can be formulated as a Mixed-Integer linear program. Load balancing is a key factor for the optical transport networks. However, the existed approaches using mixed-Integer linear program to solve the RWA problem are not perfect enough without considering the load balancing of the networks.</t><t> This documentary provides a model of Mixed-Integer Linear Programming to solve the problem of load balancing needed by routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process in optical transport networks.</t></abstract>
