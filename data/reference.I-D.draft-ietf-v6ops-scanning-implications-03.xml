<abstract><t>The 128 bits of IPv6 address space is considerably bigger than the 32 bits of address space of IPv4. In particular, the IPv6 subnets to which hosts attach will by default have 64 bits of host address space. As a result, traditional methods of remote TCP or UDP network scanning to discover open or running services on a host will potentially become less feasible, due to the larger search space in the subnet. In addition automated attacks, such as those performed by network worms, that pick random host addresses to propagate to, may be hampered. This document discusses this property of IPv6 and describes related issues for IPv6 site network administrators to consider, which may be of importance when planning site address allocation and management strategies. While traditional network scanning probes (whether by individuals or automated via network worms) may become less common, administrators should be aware of other methods attackers may use to discover IPv6 addresses on a target network, and also be aware of appropriate measures to mitigate them.</t></abstract>
