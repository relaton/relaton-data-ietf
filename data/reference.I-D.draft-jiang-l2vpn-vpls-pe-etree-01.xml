<abstract><t>The feasibility of VPLS as a general E-Tree solution is discussed. A VPLS Provider Edge(PE) model for the E-Tree support is also proposed. In this model, a Tree VSI and its PW processing is introduced which can provide connectivity with dual VLANs for an E-Tree service. MAC address based Ethernet forwarding engine works in the same way as before in this architecture. As VLAN mapping may be needed in the Ethernet PW for better scalability, control signaling needed for the VLAN mapping is also discussed.</t></abstract>
