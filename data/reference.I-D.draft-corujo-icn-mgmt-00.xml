<abstract><t>This document aims to draw the attention of the ICNRG community to network management, an important but hitherto underdeveloped area of research in information-centric networking.  We consider that the availability of modern management mechanisms for information-centric networks will foster their deployment in real-world environments. For example, we argue that there is a need for creating basic network management tools early on while ICN is still in the design and experimentation phases that can evolve over time.  Perhaps ICN can borrow successful mechanisms from the host-centric paradigm and adapt them to the new network primitives.  Alternatively, novel network management schemes can be designed based on ICN primitives.  As a discussion starter, this document summarizes recently published approaches for ICN network management.  In particular, this first version presents a management framework for named data networking and reviews previous work on NetInf management.</t></abstract>
