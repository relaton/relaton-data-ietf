<abstract><t>The Diameter Maintenance and Extensions (DIME) working group has undertaken an "overload control" work item, with the goal of standardizing a mechanism to allow Diameter nodes to report overload information among themselves.  Requirements currently include, among others, the need to accurately report the scope of overload conditions, and the ability to report overload information between nodes that are not directly connected at the transport layer.  These requirements introduce complex issues.  This document describes those issues, in the hope that it will assist the working group's decision process.</t></abstract>
