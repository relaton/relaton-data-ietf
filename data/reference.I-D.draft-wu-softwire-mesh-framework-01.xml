<abstract><t>The Softwires Mesh Problem identifies a requirement for a generalized, network-based client IPvX-over-backbone IPvY solution, where for the case where X=4 and Y=6, as well as the case where X=6 and Y=4. BGP is used to distribute the routing information needed to ensure connectivity among the client networks. Forwarding between client networks is done by means of IP or MPLS tunnels, known as "softwires". The solution is largely composed of existing technology, in some cases with minor modifications. This framework describes the overall solution, how the components of the solution fit together, and specifies those areas in which new or modified technology must be developed.</t></abstract>
