<abstract><t>The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol is an XML-based protocol for mapping service identifiers and geodetic or civic location information to service URIs and service boundaries.  In particular, it can be used to determine the location-appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for emergency services.  The main data structure, the XML &lt;mapping> element, used for encapsulating information about service boundaries is defined in the LoST protocol specification and circumscribes the region within which all locations map to the same service URI or set of URIs for a given service.  This document defines an XML protocol to exchange these mappings between two nodes.  As motived in the Location-to-URL Mapping Architecture document this mechanism is useful for the synchronization of top-level LoST Forest Guides.  This document is, however, even useful in a deployment that does not make use of the LoST protocol but purely wants to distribute service boundaries.</t></abstract>
