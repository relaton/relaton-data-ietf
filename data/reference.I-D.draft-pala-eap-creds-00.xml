<abstract><t>With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network access, the need for a standardized credentials provisioning and management framework is paramount.  The .1x architecture allows for entities (e.g., devices, applications, etc.) to authenticate to the network by providing a communication channel where different methods can be used to exchange different types of credentials.  However, the need for managing these credentials (i.e., provisioning and renewal) is still a hard problem to solve.  This specifications define how to support the provisioning and management of authentication credentials that can be exploited in different environments (e.g., Wired, WiFi, cellular, etc.) to users and/or devices by using EAP together with standard provisioning protocols.</t></abstract>
