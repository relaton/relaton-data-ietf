<abstract><t>The General Area Review Team (Gen-ART) has been doing Reviews of Internet Drafts (I-Ds) since 2004.  This document discusses the experience and the lessons learned over the past 7 years of this process.  The review team initially reviewed the I-Ds before each of the IESG telechats.  Since late 2005, review team members have been assigned to review I-Ds during IETF Last Call, unless no IETF Last Call is necessary for the I-D.  The same reviewer then reviews any updates when the I-D is placed on an IESG telechat agenda.</t></abstract>
