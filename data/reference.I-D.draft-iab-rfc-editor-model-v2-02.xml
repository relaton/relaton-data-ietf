<abstract><t>The RFC Editor performs a number of functions that may be carried out by various persons or entities.  The RFC Editor model described in this document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into three functions: The RFC Series Editor, the RFC Production Center, and the RFC Publisher.  The function of the Independent Submission Editor is also defined here.  The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) oversight by way of delegation to the RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC) is described, as is the relationship between the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) and the RSOC.  This document reflects 1 year of experience with RFC Editor Model version 1.</t></abstract>
