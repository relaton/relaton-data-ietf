<abstract><t>The current EAP documentation set, such as [EAP3748], [EAPKEY6], and [RADEAP3579] provide a powerful framework for performing combined authentication and key management using an EAP server and an AAA infrastructure. The framework competently deals with many issues related to network-access control and link security setup. However, when it comes to deploying these specifications for mobile wireless environments, where a peer is required to perform fast and/or heterogeneous handovers, the current framework can be extended with more clear guidelines and possibly specifications in ways that prevent interoperability or security issues. This draft intends to explore some of the complications in deploying the EAP framework for handovers and analyze a few solution alternatives. Further threat analysis of each alternative or providing trade-off guidelines for support of handover may be part of the future revisions of this document.</t></abstract>
