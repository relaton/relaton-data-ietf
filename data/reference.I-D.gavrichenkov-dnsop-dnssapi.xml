<abstract><t>Managed DNS services are widely used to maintain DNS zones. Virtually all of them have an API of some sort, in most cases an XML- RPC or JSON-RPC API, while most of them lack the support of zone transfers.  The latter is unlikely to change any time soon due to the reasons outlined below.  This document describes a protocol, a common denominator of existing API protocols, that both a service provider and its customer can use to exchange information about DNS zones and policies.</t></abstract>
