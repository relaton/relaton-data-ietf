<abstract><t>IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer traffic Optimization) that includes a "Network Map Service", an "Endpoint Cost Service" and an "Endpoint (EP) Ranking Service" and thus incentives for application clients to connect to ISP preferred Endpoints.  These services provide a view of the Network Provider (NP) topology to overlay clients.  The present draft proposes a light way to extend the information provided by the current ALTO protocol.  The purpose is to broaden the possibilities of the Application Clients in two ways: firstly by providing a better mapping of the Selected Endpoints to needs of the growing diversity of Content Networking Applications and to the network conditions, secondly by producing a more robust choice of multiple Endpoints, helping thus out for efficient Multi-Path transfer.  There are 2 parts in this draft: the first part initiates protocol extensions to support requests on multiple Cost Types in one single transaction.  These first extensions also integrate the discussions within the ALTO Working Group and focus on the Endpoint Cost Service. The second part proposes two use cases motivating further definitions of additional CostTypes and Cost Attributes related to timeframe and validity period.</t></abstract>
