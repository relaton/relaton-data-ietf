<abstract><t>The requirements of MPLS-TP in RFC 5654 include a requirement(R63) that requires MPLS-TP MUST be possible to provide protection for MPLS-TP data plane without any IP forwarding capability and control plane.If applying 1:1 protection for the p2mp traffic in rfc6718 , it must have a return path to coordinate the switch state to select the same path to receive and send the traffic packet.As there exists the above problem statement,This document describes a kind of protection solution to recovery and protect the p2mp traffic under the failure condition.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t></abstract>
