<abstract><t>This document specify how to compute the 'tls-unique-prf' data that is cryptographically bound to a specific Transport Layer Security (TLS) session.  The intention is to use this data as a name of the secure channel for the purpose of a channel binding.  The channel bindings can be used by authentication protocols to avoid tunneling attacks and security layer re-use.  The data is derived using the TLS Pseudo-Random Function (PRF).  Applications of this include SASL- based protocols like IMAP, SMTP and XMPP.  The channel binding 'tls- unique-prf' defined in this document is an alternative to 'tls- unique' as described by RFC 5929 and used by SCRAM and GS2.</t></abstract>
