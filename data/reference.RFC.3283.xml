<abstract><t>This document describes the various Internet calendaring and scheduling standards and works in progress, and the relationships between them. Its intent is to provide a context for these documents, assist in their understanding, and potentially aid in the design of standards-based calendaring and scheduling systems.  The standards addressed are RFC 2445 (iCalendar), RFC 2446 (iTIP), and RFC 2447 (iMIP).  The work in progress addressed is &quot;Calendar Access Protocol&quot; (CAP).  This document also describes issues and problems that are not solved by these protocols, and that could be targets for future work.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
