<abstract><t>The forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol defines a standard communication and control mechanism through which a Control Element (CE) can control the behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE). That control is accomplished through manipulating attributes of Logical Function Blocks (LFBs), whose structure is defined in a model RFC produced by the working group. In order to build an actual solution based on this protocol, defining a set of Logical Function Block definitions that can be instantiated by FEs and controlled by CEs is welcome. A base library definition of LFBs is already given in library [5]. VPN (Virtual Private Network) services, as a kind of important services widely employed in Internet, will certainly be implemented in routers using this protocol. This document provides an initial set of VPN LFB definitions in particular, a set of tunnel encapsulator and decapsulator LFBs. It is anticipated that additional VPN-related LFB definitions like L2VPN, L3VPN can be defined over time.</t></abstract>
