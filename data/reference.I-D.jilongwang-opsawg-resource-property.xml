<abstract><t>This memo discusses and defines a framework for cyberspace resource property description, which is suitable for the unified classification organization and description of multi-source network resource measurement information.  Now, there is no unified description framework for network resource property.  The objective of this draft is to establish a general model based on cyberspace identification reference, and implement the reuse of survey data in different users and occasions.  Then discuss the basic methodology and propose a less mature framework for further complement and improvement</t></abstract>
