<abstract><t>This document identifies one type of the denial of service attack which can be possible in Mobile IP6 and tries to propose a solution for same. Currently in MIP6 each Home Agent is required to maintain a home agent list. This home agent list is generated by receiving RA messages on the home link and the addresses learned are sent to Mobile node when it does Home Agent discovery. On learning this list MN tries to register with addresses in this list one by one in order of preference. Now if the home network is flooded with spurious RA packets having high preference value the home agent list is populated with non reachable addresses and no mobile node is able to register from that home network This document proposes to first carry out reachability confirmation for each home agent entry before adding to Home Agent list</t></abstract>
