<abstract><t>This document extends the Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT), which is a token object that conveys cryptographically signed information about the participants involved in communications.  The extension is defined based on the &quot;Signature-based Handling of Asserted                                     information using toKENs (SHAKEN)&quot; specification by the ATIS/SIP Forum IP-NNI Task Group.  It provides both (1) a specific set of levels of confidence in the correctness of the originating identity of a call originated in a SIP-based telephone network as well as (2) an identifier that allows the Service Provider (SP) to uniquely identify the origin of the call within its network.</t></abstract>
