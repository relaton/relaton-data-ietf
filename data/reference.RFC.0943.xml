<abstract><t>This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently    assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol    implementations.  This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case    current information can be obtained from Joyce Reynolds.  The assignment    of numbers is also handled by Joyce.  If you are developing a protocol    or application that will require the use of a link, socket, port,    protocol, network number, etc., please contact Joyce to receive a number    assignment.  This memo is an official status report on the numbers used    in protocols in the ARPA-Internet community. See RFC-990 and 997.</t></abstract>
