<abstract><t>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal mode.  This highly restricts what the customer can do until the customer has authenticated.  This document describes a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 option and a Router Advertisement (RA) option to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive-portal enforcement device, and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet access.  It is not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to be one component of a standardized approach for hosts to interact with such portals.  While this document defines how the network operator may convey the captive portal API endpoint to hosts, the specific methods of authenticating to, and interacting with the captive portal are out of scope of this document.  This document replaces RFC 7710.  RFC 7710 used DHCP code point 160. Due to a conflict, this document specifies 114.
