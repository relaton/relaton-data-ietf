<abstract><t>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include query capabilities to find the list of domains related to a set of entities matching a given search pattern.  Even if such capabilities, commonly referred as reverse search, respond to some needs not yet readily fulfilled by the current Whois protocol, they have raised concerns from two perspectives: server processing impact and data privacy. Anyway, the impact of the reverse queries on RDAP servers processing is the same as the standard searches and it can be reduced by implementing policies to deal with large result sets, while data privacy risks can be prevented by RDAP access control functionality. In the RDAP context, an entity can be associated to any defined object class.  Therefore, a reverse search can be applied to other use cases than the classic domain-entity scenario.  This document describes an RDAP search query extension that allows clients to request a reverse search based on the relationship between an object and the associated entities.</t></abstract>
