<abstract><t>Multicast Receiver Access Control must be enforced at both the application level and at the network level.  The control at the two levels must be correlated, to ensure that only a legitimate group member at the application level is permitted to join group at the network level.  We assume that authentication and authorization at the application level are provided by Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) exchanges.  We describe how to use Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) to transport the EAP packets in such a way that authententication and authorization can be easily achieved at the network level and that the necessary coordination is achieved.</t></abstract>
