<abstract><t>There are many deployment scenarios which require Egress LSR to receive binding of the RSVP-TE LSP to an application, and payload identification, using some "out-of-band" (OOB) mechanism. This document proposes protocol mechanisms to address this requirement. The procedures described in this document are equally applicable for point-to-point (P2P) and point-to- multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.</t></abstract>
