<abstract><t>This document presents home control and automation application specific requirements for Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL). In a modern home, a high number of wireless devices are used for a wide set of purposes. Examples include actuators (relay, light dimmer, heating valve), sensors (wall switch, water leak, blood pressure) and advanced controllers. Because such devices only cover a limited radio range, routing is  often required. The aim of this document is to specify the routing requirements for networks comprising such constrained devices in a home control and automation environment.</t></abstract>
