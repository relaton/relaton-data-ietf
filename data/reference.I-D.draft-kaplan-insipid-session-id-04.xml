<abstract><t>This RFC, which contains the text of an individual Internet Draft that was submitted originally to the DISPATCH Working Group, is being published now as an Informational document to provide a reference for later RFCs.  The mechanism defined in this document has been widely deployed, and is being followed in a backward- compatible fashion for a new Standards Track RFC in the INSIPID Working Group.  The original Abstract follows.  There is a need for having a globally unique session identifier for the same SIP session, which can be consistently maintained across SIP Proxies, Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs), and other SIP middle-boxes, for the purpose of Troubleshooting.  This draft proposes a new SIP header to carry such a value: Session-ID.</t></abstract>
