<abstract><t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. The overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered on every link in the PCN-domain, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded.  The level of marking allows the boundary nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request, and (in abnormal circumstances) whether to terminate some of the existing flows, thereby protecting the QoS of previously admitted flows.  This document specifies how such marks are to be encoded into the IP header by re-using the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within this controlled domain.  This encoding builds on the baseline encoding and provides for three PCN encoding states: Not-marked, Threshold-marked and Excess-traffic-marked.</t></abstract>
