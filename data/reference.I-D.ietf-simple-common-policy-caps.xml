<abstract><t>An important component of presence and location services is policy. Policy systems allow the presentity or location target to grant access to specific pieces of information to specific watchers or requestors. These policy systems can be extremely simple, allowing a user to accept or block requests based solely on the identity of the requestor, to extremely complex, allowing for time based rules that grant or deny specific pieces of information. Policy systems often support vendor proprietary features. To allow for interoperability between clients which set such policies, and servers which execute them, it is necessary for clients to be able to determine the capabilities of the server to which it is connected. This specification defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) based format for expressing such capabilities.</t></abstract>
