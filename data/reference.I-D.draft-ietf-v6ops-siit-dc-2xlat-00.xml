<abstract><t>This document describes an extension of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Data Centre Environments architecture (SIIT-DC), which allows applications, protocols, or nodes that are incompatible with IPv6, SIIT-DC and/or Network Address Translation in general to operate correctly in an SIIT-DC environment.  This is accomplished by introducing a new component called an Edge Translator, which reverses the translations made by an SIIT-DC Gateway.  The application or device is thus provided with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity.  The reader is expected to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture described in I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc.</t></abstract>
