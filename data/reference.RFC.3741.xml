<abstract><t>Canonical XML specifies a standard serialization of XML that, when applied to a subdocument, includes the subdocument's ancestor context including all of the namespace declarations and attributes in the &quot;xml:&quot; namespace.  However, some applications require a method which, to the extent practical, excludes ancestor context from a canonicalized subdocument.  For example, one might require a digital signature over an XML payload (subdocument) in an XML message that will not break when that subdocument is removed from its original message and/or inserted into a different context.  This requirement is satisfied by Exclusive XML Canonicalization.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
