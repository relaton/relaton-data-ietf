<abstract><t>Mobile IP is good at addressing IP session continuity (hide of the IP address change from transport layer perspective, as well as from the correspondent perspective) but certainly not optimal for mobility management as would perform 3GPP systems providers that want to extend their services to IP access systems. This document only describes the problem and is not meant to provide any solution nor any requirement thereof.</t></abstract>
