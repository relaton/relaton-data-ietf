<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks. PCE can be stateless or stateful. With the LSP state information acquired from the network, a stateful PCE enables a wide variety of applications, especially in GMPLS networks, such as impairment-aware routing and wavelength assignment in wavelength- switched optical networks (WSON), time-based scheduling applications. This memo provides extensions required for PCE communication protocol (i.e. PCEP) so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability in GMPLS networks. To be more specific, the PCEP extensions specified in this memo include not only new objects but also modification of existing objects in PCEP messages.</t></abstract>
