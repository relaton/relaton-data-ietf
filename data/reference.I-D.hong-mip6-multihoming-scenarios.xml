<abstract><t>This document describes the multihoming issues in Mobile IP networks. It specifies the basic multihoming scenario, a mobile node is multihomed to multiple home agents within an AS, then describes the multihoming method for this basic scenario. The principle of the multihoming method in this document is that multiple home agents share security associations established between a mobile node and a home agent. By sharing security associations among home agents who serve the same home link, we can reduce the burden of MN to manage the HA list. This document points out technical issues related to sharing security associations among home agents and specifies possible solutions for them. Also, this document describes how to extend the basic multihoming method to more complicated multihoming cases such as multiple home agents in different AS.</t></abstract>
