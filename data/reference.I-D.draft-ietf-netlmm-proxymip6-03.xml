<abstract><t>This specification describes a network-based mobility management protocol. It is called Proxy Mobile IPv6 and is based on Mobile IPv6 [RFC-3775]. This protocol enables mobility support to a host without requiring its participation in any mobility related signaling. The design principle in the case of network-based mobility management protocol relies on the network being in control of the mobility management. The mobility entities in the network are responsible for tracking the movements of the host and initiating the required mobility signaling on its behalf.</t></abstract>
