<abstract><t>This document describes an extension to IKEv2 that allows an endpoint which has authenticated to a gateway to request a short-term credential, possession of which proves the authentication. This allows it to prove to a security gateway that it was already authenticated by another trusted security gateway, thereby allowing the authentication of the endpoint without user intervention. This credential is a certificate issued by the authenticating gateway for a short period of time, which can be used to authenticate the user with IKE signature based authentication.</t></abstract>
