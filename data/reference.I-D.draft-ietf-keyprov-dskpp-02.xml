<abstract><t>DSKPP is a client-server protocol for initialization (and configuration) of symmetric keys to locally and remotely accessible cryptographic modules.  The protocol can be run with or without private-key capabilities in the cryptographic modules, and with or without an established public-key infrastructure.  Two variations of the protocol support multiple usage scenarios.  The four-pass (i.e., two round-trip) variant enables key generation in near real-time.  With the four-pass variant, keys are mutually generated by the provisioning server and cryptographic module; provisioned keys are not transferred over-the-wire or over-the-air. The two-pass variant enables secure and efficient download and installation of symmetric keys to a cryptographic module in environments where near real-time communication may not be possible.  This document builds on information contained in [RFC4758], adding specific enhancements in response to implementation experience and liaison requests.  It is intended that this document or a successor version thereto will become the basis for subsequent progression of a symmetric key provisioning protocol specification on the standards track.</t></abstract>
