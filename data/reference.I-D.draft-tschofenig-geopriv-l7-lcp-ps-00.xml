<abstract><t>This document provides a problem statement and requirements for a GEOPRIV Layer 7 Location Configuration Protocol. The purpose of this protocol is for an end host to obtain location information from a special node, called the Location Information Server (LIS), and to optionally request the creation of a subscription URI. The LIS is located in the access network. The location information can then, for example, be used by the Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) and in SIP for location conveyance. The subscription URI can be used by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in order to obtain the most recenty location information, possibly in combination with location filters that limit the rate of notifications. Disclaimer: This document represents the current status of the discussions at the Geopriv-L7 design team and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of every design team participant.</t></abstract>
