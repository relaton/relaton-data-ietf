<abstract><t>Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but can occur due to a variety of reasons including unplanned network outages.  In unicast transmissions, recovering from such an outage can be difficult depending on the outage duration due to the potential large number of missing packets.  In multicast transmissions, recovery is even more challenging as many receivers could be impacted by the outage.  One solution to this challenge without incurring unbounded delay is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate redundant streams, provided that the underlying network satisfies certain requirements.  This document explains how Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams can be duplicated without breaking RTP or RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.</t></abstract>
