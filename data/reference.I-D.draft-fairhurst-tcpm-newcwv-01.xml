<abstract><t>This document addresses issues that arise when TCP is used to support variable-rate traffic that includes periods where the transmission rate is limited by the application.  It evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation (TCP-CWV), an IETF experimental specification defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that TCP-CWV sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a widely used solution.  The document recommends that the IETF should consider moving RFC 2861 from Experimental to Historic status, and replacing this with the current specification, which updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following either an idle or data-limited period.  The method is expected to benefit variable-rate TCP applications, while also providing an appropriate response if congestion is experienced.</t></abstract>
