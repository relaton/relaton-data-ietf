<abstract><t>BGP is being used as the underlay routing protocol in some large- scaled data centers (DCs).  Most popular design followed is to do hop-by-hop external BGP (EBGP) session configurations between neighboring routers on a per link basis.  The provisioning of BGP neighbors in routers across such a DC brings its own operational complexity.  This document introduces a BGP neighbor discovery mechanism that greatly simplifies BGP operations in such DC and other networks by automatic setup of BGP sessions between neighbor routers using this mechanism.</t></abstract>
