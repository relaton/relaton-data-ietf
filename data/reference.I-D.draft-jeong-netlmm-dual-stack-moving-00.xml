<abstract><t>This memo describes the network-based mobility support for dual stack mobile nodes moving into an IPv4-only or an IPv6-only subnetwork within a NETLMM domain. This memo also presents a network-based global mobility management protocol with support of IPv4-IPv6 traversal. By utilizing this document, mobile nodes can move from an IPv4/IPv6 dual stack localized domain to an IPv6-only (or IPv4-only) localized domain without any IP session disruption.</t></abstract>
