<abstract><t>RADIUS specifications have used data types for two decades, without rigorously defining them as managed entities.  During this time, RADIUS implementations have named the data types, and have used them to as managed entities in attribute definitions.  This document updates the specifications to match established prctice.  We do this by naming data types defined in [RFC6158], which have been used since at least [RFC2865].  We provide an IANA registry for the data types, and update the RADIUS Attribute Type registry to include a "data type" field for each attribute.  Finally, we recommend that authors of RADIUS specifications use these types in preference to existing practice.</t></abstract>
