<abstract><t>The Secure Internet Indirection Infrastructure (Secure-i3) is a proposal for a flexible and secure overlay network that, if universally deployed, would effectively block a number of denial-of-service problems in the Internet. The Host Identity Protocol (HIP), on the other hand, is a proposal for deploying opportunistic, IPsec based end-to-end security, allowing any hosts to communicate in a secure way through the Internet. In this paper, we explore various possibilities for combining ideas from Secure-i3 and HIP, thereby producing an architecture that is more efficient and secure than Secure-i3 and more flexible and denial-of-service resistant than HIP.</t></abstract>
