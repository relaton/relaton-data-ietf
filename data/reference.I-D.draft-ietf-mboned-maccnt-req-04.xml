<abstract><t>This memo presents requirements in the area of accounting and access control for multicasting. General requirements for accounting capabilities including quality-of-service (QoS) related issues are listed. Finally, cases for Content Delivery Services (CDS) are described as application examples which could benefit from multicasting accounting and access control capabilities as described in the I-D. It is proposed that this I-D be used as a starting point for further discussion on these issues.</t></abstract>
