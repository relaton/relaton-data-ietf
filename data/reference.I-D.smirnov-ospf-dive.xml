<abstract><t>Many popular topologies for large-scale networks have highly regular structure with distinctive design pattern.  Examples of such topologies include hub-and-spoke (also known as "star") common in enterprise WAN networks, fat-tree and Clos topologies common in datacenters.  For number of reasons in such large-scale networks distance-vector protocols perform better than OSPF.  On the other hand network backbones have no highly regular topology pattern and there OSPF outperforms distance-vector protocols.  As a result large- scale networks frequently employ different routing protocols in different regions of the network, complicating network operations.  This document proposes OSPF extensions to improve scalability of routing for large-scale networks.</t></abstract>
