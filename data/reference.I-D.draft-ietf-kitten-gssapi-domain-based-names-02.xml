<abstract><t>This document describes domainname-based service principal names and the corresponding name type for the Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API). Domain-based service names are similar to host-based service names, but using a domain name (not necessarily an Internet domain name) instead of or in addition to a hostname. The primary purpose of domain-based service names is to provide a way to name clustered services after the domain which they service, thereby allowing their clients to authorize the service's servers based on authentication of their names.</t></abstract>
