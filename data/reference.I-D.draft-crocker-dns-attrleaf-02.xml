<abstract><t>Historically, any DNS RR may occur for any domain name. Recent additions have defined DNS leaf nodes that contain a reserved node name, beginning with an underscore. The underscore construct is used to define a semantic scope for the associated, parent domain name, within which the use of some RRs is constrained. Hence the underscore construct defines a basic paradigm modification to the DNS. This note explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the procedures for registering "underscore names" with IANA.</t></abstract>
