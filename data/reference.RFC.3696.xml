<abstract><t>Many Internet applications have been designed to deduce top-level domains (or other domain name labels) from partial information.  The introduction of new top-level domains, especially non-country-code ones, has exposed flaws in some of the methods used by these applications.  These flaws make it more difficult, or impossible, for users of the applications to access the full Internet.  This memo discusses some of the techniques that have been used and gives some guidance for minimizing their negative impact as the domain name environment evolves.  This document draws summaries of the applicable rules together in one place and supplies references to the actual standards.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
