<abstract><t>This document provides an overview of the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) service and describes how it can fit into a messaging service. It also describes how DKIM relates to other IETF message signature technologies.  It is intended for those who are adopting, developing, or deploying DKIM.  DKIM allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be validated by a recipient.  The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents. An organization may use one or more domain names to accomplish this. DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public-key cryptography and key server technology [RFC4871].  This permits verification of a message source, an intermediary, or one of their agents, as well as the integrity of its contents.  DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages.  Such protection of email identity can assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing".</t></abstract>
