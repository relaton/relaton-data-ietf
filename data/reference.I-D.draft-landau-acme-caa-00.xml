<abstract><t>The ACME protocol provides a means for hosts to automatically request and obtain X.509 certificates from certificate authorities. Certification authorities which implement ACME may also choose to implement the CAA DNS record, which allows a domain to communicate issuance policy to CAs.  The CAA specification alone allows a domain to define policy with CA-level granularity.  However, the CAA specification also provides facilities for extension to admit more granular, CA-specific policy.  This specification defines such a parameter.</t></abstract>
