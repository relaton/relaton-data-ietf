<abstract><t>When certain RSVP-TE optimizations are implemented, ingress Label Switching Router (LSRs) can receive RSVP RESV messages before forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes. According to the RSVP-TE specification, the ingress LSR can forward traffic through a Label Switched Path (LSP) as soon as it receives a RESV message.  However, if the ingress LSR forwards traffic through the LSP before forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes, traffic can be lost.</t><t>This document describes LSP Self-ping.  When an ingress LSR receives an RESV message, it can invoke LSP Self-ping procedures to ensure that forwarding state has been installed on all downstream nodes.</t><t>LSP Self-ping is a new protocol.  It is not an extension of LSP Ping. Although LSP Ping and LSP Self-ping are named similarly, each is designed for a unique purpose.  Each protocol listens on its own UDP port and executes its own procedures.</t><t>LSP Self-ping is an extremely lightweight mechanism.  It does not consume control-plane resources on transit or egress LSRs.</t></abstract>
