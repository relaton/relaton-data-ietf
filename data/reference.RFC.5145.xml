<abstract><t>The migration from Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) to Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is the process of evolving an MPLS-TE control plane to a GMPLS control plane.  An appropriate migration strategy will be selected based on various factors including the service provider's network deployment plan, customer demand, and operational policy.</t><t>This document presents several migration models and strategies for migrating from MPLS-TE to GMPLS.  In the course of migration, MPLS-TE and GMPLS devices, or networks, may coexist that may require interworking between MPLS-TE and GMPLS protocols.  Aspects of the required interworking are discussed as it will influence the choice of a migration strategy.  This framework document provides a migration toolkit to aid the operator in selection of an appropriate strategy.</t><t>This framework document also lists a set of solutions that may aid in interworking, and highlights a set of potential issues.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
