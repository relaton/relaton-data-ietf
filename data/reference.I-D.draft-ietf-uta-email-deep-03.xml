<abstract><t>This specification defines a set of requirements and facilities designed to improve email confidentiality between a mail user agent (MUA) and a mail submission or mail access server.  This provides mechanisms intended to increase use of already deployed Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology, provide a model for mail user agent's confidentiality assurance, and enable mail service providers to advertise improved TLS confidentiality facilities.</t></abstract>
