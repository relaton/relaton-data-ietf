<abstract><t>There are times that an LSP source node needs to know change(s) has occurred along the originally established LSP path. This is especially true in the Mobile Backhaul environment where microwave transport is widely deployed. The bandwidth provided by the microwave transport can change with weather. The source LSR, e.g. LTE's eNodeB, needs to adjust its admission rate or shift more load to alternative paths when the backhaul transport path condition is changed.  This draft describes a simple mechanism for transit LSRs to notify Source LSR of the path condition changes.</t></abstract>
