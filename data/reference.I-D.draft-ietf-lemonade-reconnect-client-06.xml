<abstract><t>This document defines an IMAP4 extension, which gives an IMAP client the ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as part of the SELECT command, without the need for server-side state or additional client round-trips.  This extension also introduces a new response that allows for a more compact representation for a list of expunged messages (and always includes the UIDs expunged).Changes since draft-ietf-lemonade-reconnect-client-05.txt  o  Many editorial improvements from Randy Gellens.  o  Remove RECENT response from the list of responses that doesn't  need to be returned when VANISHED is also returned.  o  Clarified that VANISHED (EARLIER) must be returned before any  FETCH.  o  Fixed some typos in examples.  o  Require that any client issues ENABLE QRESYNC first.  Servers now  reject SELECT QRESYNC/FETCH VANISHED not preceeded by ENABLE  QRESYNC with BAD.</t></abstract>
