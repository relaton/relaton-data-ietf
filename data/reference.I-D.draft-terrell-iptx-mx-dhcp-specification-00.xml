<abstract><t>This document defines the IPtX Specification for the 'Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol'; IPtX / IPtX-MX DHCP (DHCPvIPtX-MX), which provides Backwards Compatibility with the IPv4 Specification without compromise or change to current DHCP Server and Client Configuration and / or Operational Requirements. And more importantly, because the IPtX / IPtX-MX Specification represents a 3 State Binary IP Addressing Specification, there are 2 IP Address Band Specifications; Mobile IP Address Pool and a Stationary IP Address Pool, with a 3 Dimensional Locator, which represents a 3 IP Address Coordinate System that uses an EMERGENCY Broadcast [e911] to establish a Synchronized LINK with 3 different [KNOWN] Router Locations and the MAC Address, to Triangulate the Location of any Node Connected to the Network.</t></abstract>
