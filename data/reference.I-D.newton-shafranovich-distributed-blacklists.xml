<abstract><t>Many traditional, centrally-managed blacklists and whitelists describe Internet end-points by characteristics such as connectivity type or network function, and these characteristics are often used to infer behavior from which authorization is derived. However, it is often the case that connectivity type or network function are not related to good or bad behavior. This document describes a means of creating blacklists and whitelists representative of Internet end-points based on observed behavior by many participants in a distributed monitoring network. The authors hope that distributed lists will mitigate some of the problems associated with existing centrally managed lists. While the concept, architecture, and data model are general enough to be applied to any type of network service, the authors of this document are specifically addressing the problem of spam in blogs.</t></abstract>
