<abstract><t>The process of producing today's Internet through a culture of open participation and diverse collaboration has proved strikingly efficient and effective, and it is distinctive among standards organizations.  For its early years, participation in the IETF and its antecedent was almost entirely composed of well-funded, American, white, male engineers, establishing a distinctive and challenging group dynamic, both in management and in personal interactions.  In the case of the IETF, interaction style can often demonstrate singularly aggressive behavior, often including singularly hostile tone and content.  Groups with greater diversity make better decisions.  Obtaining meaningful diversity requires more than generic good will and statements of principle.  Many different behaviors can serve to reduce participant diversity or participation diversity. This paper discusses IETF participation, in terms of the nature of diversity and practical issues that can increase or decrease it.</t></abstract>
