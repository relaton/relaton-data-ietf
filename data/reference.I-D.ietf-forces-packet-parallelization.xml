<abstract><t>Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE).  RFC5812 has defined the ForCES Model provides a formal way to represent the capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding elements within the context of the ForCES protocol (RFC 5810), so that Control Elements (CEs) can control the Forwarding Elements (FEs) accordingly.  More specifically, the model describes the logical functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are or can be interconnected.  Many network devices support parallel packet processing.  This document describes how ForCES can model a network device's parallelization datapath.</t></abstract>
