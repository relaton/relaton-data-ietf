<abstract><t>This document proposes a differentiated services per-domain behavior (PDB) whose traffic may be &quot;starved&quot; (although starvation is not strictly required) in a properly functioning network.  This is in contrast to the Internet's &quot;best-effort&quot; or &quot;normal Internet traffic&quot; model, where prolonged starvation indicates network problems.  In this sense, the proposed PDB's traffic is forwarded with a &quot;lower&quot; priority than the normal &quot;best-effort&quot; Internet traffic, thus the PDB is called &quot;Lower Effort&quot; (LE).  Use of this PDB permits a network operator to strictly limit the effect of its traffic on &quot;best-effort&quot;/&quot;normal&quot; or all other Internet traffic.  This document gives some example uses, but does not propose constraining the PDB's use to any particular type of traffic.</t></abstract>
