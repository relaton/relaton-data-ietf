<abstract><t>This document describes extensions to OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).  The extensions, called OSPF-OR (OSPF-Overlapping Relay), include mechanisms for link-local signaling (LLS), an OSPF-MANET interface, a simple technique to reduce the size of Hello packets by only transmitting incremental state changes, and a method for optimized flooding of routing updates.  OSPF-OR also provides a means to reduce unnecessary adjacencies to support larger MANETs.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
