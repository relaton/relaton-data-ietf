<abstract><t>This document specifies new File Transfer Protocol (FTP)  commands to allow for a distributed FTP server to operate  correctly. The purpose is to address an issue in the FTP  Protocol which causes a truely distributed FTP server from  being possible.  Truely distributed meaning that data-connections do not need  to be routed through the FTP server, itself, to be transferred  to the client, and allowing data to be stored completely  separately from the FTP Server.
