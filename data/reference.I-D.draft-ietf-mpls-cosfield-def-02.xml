<abstract><t>The early MPLS documents defined the form of a the MPLS Label Stack entry.  This include a three bit field called the "EXP field".  The exact use of this field was not defined by these documents, except to state that it is to be "reserved for experimental use".  Although the intended use of the EXP field was as a "Class of Service" field, it was not named the "Class of Service" (CoS) field by these early documents because the use of such a CoS field was not considered to be sufficiently defined.  Today a number of standards documents define its usage as a CoS field. .  To avoid misunderstanding about how this field may be used this document re-introduces the name "CoS field" for this field.  In doing so it also updates documents that define the current usee of the EXP this field.</t></abstract>
