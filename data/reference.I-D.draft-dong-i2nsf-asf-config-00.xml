<abstract><t>This draft defines a network security function (NSF-) facing interface of the security controller for the purpose of configuring some advanced security functions.  These advanced security functions include antivirus, anti-ddos, and intrusion prevention system (IPS). The interface is presented in a YANG data model fashion and can be used to deploy a large amount of NSF blocks that all support above mentioned functions in the software defined network (SDN) based paradigm.</t></abstract>
