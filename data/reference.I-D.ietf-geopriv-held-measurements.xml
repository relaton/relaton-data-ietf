<abstract><t>This document describes a protocol for a Device to provide location- related measurement data to a Location Information Server (LIS) within a request for location information.  Location-related measurement information are observations concerning properties related to the position of a Device, which could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment.  A LIS is able to use the location-related measurement data to improve the accuracy of the location estimate it provides to the Device.  A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.</t></abstract>
