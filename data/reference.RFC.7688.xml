<abstract><t>This document provides Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing enhancements to support signal compatibility constraints associated with Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) elements.  These routing enhancements are applicable in common optical or hybrid electro-optical networks where not all the optical signals in the network are compatible with all network elements participating in the network.</t><t>This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common optical or hybrid electro-optical systems such as optical-electronic-optical (OEO) switches, regenerators, and wavelength converters, since such systems can be limited to processing only certain types of WSON signals.</t></abstract>
