<abstract><t>Today, a BGP speaker can advertise one nexthop for a set of NLRIs in an Update.  This nexthop can be encoded in either the BGP-Nexthop attribute (code 3), or inside the MP_REACH attribute (code 14).  For cases where multiple nexthops need to be advertised, BGP-Addpath is used.  Though Addpath allows basic ability to advertise multiple- nexthops, it does not allow the sender to specify desired relationship between the multiple nexthops being advertised e.g., relative-preference, type of load-balancing.  These are local decisions at the receiving speaker based on path-selection between the various additional-paths, which may tie-break on some arbitrary step like Router-Id.  Some scenarios with a BGP-free core may benefit from having a mechanism, where egress-node can signal multiple-nexthops along with their relationship to ingress nodes.  This document defines a new BGP attribute "MultiNexthop" that can be used for this purpose.  This attribute can be used for both labeled and unlabled BGP families.  For labeled-families, it is used for a different purpose in "downstream allocation" case than "upstream allocation" scenarios.</t></abstract>
