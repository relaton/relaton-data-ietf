<abstract><t>This document outlines the functionality required for a P2P streaming Tracker Protocol, including functional entities and architecture, components, encoding format and syntax.  The Tracker protocol is an application-level protocol for peers to publish/request content and provide peer status to Trackers.  It is also used by trackers to provide peer lists to peers, as well as to send control/management messages to and communicate with other trackers.  The PPSP tracker protocol can serve live media and VoD, as well as file sharing applications.</t></abstract>
