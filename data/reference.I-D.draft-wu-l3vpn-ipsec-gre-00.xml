<abstract><t>Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Network (PPVPN)[RFC4110] uses some forms of IP tunneling schemes to tunnel VPN traffic.  Possible candidates are GRE, IP-in-IP, IPsec and MPLS.  The candidate tunneling scheme should provide multiplexing capability, as well as dynamic tunnel setup and maintenance capability.  Additionally, security is required if the VPN traffic is traversing public Internet or across Service Provider domains.  Each above candidate by itself is not sufficient to meet all these requirements.  This document describes a method of using IPsec signaling (i.e, IKE) to setup a GRE tunnel.  This IPsec GRE tunnel may be used as the candidate tunneling scheme in PPVPN network or remote access compulsory VPN.  This document also defines a way how the Key field in GRE header is used in IPsec GRE tunnel setup.</t></abstract>
