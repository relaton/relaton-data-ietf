<abstract><t>The SIP &quot;Caller Preferences&quot; extension defined in RFC 3840 provides a mechanism that allows a SIP request to convey information relating to the originator's capabilities and preferences for handling of that request.  The SIP REFER method defined in RFC 3515 provides a mechanism that allows one party to induce another to initiate a SIP request.  This document extends the REFER method to use the mechanism of RFC 3840.  By doing so, the originator of a REFER may inform the recipient as to the characteristics of the target that the induced request is expected to reach.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
