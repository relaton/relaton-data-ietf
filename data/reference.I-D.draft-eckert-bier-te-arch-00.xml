<abstract><t>This document proposes an architecture for BIER-TE: Traffic Engineering for Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER).  BIER-TE shares part of its architecture with BIER as described in [I-D.wijnands-bier-architecture].  It also proposes to share the packet format with BIER.  BIER-TE forwards and replicates packets like BIER based on a BitString in the packet header but it does not require an IGP.  It does support traffic engineering by explicit hop-by-hop forwarding and loose hop forwarding of packets.  It does support Fast ReRoute (FRR) for link and node protection and incremental deployment. Because BIER-TE like BIER operates without explicit in-network tree- building but also supports traffic engineering, it is more similar to SR than RSVP-TE.</t></abstract>
