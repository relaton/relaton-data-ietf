<title>Forward Error Correction Grouping Semantics in the Session Description Protocol</title>
<author initials='A.' surname='Begen' fullname='A. Begen'><organization /></author>
<date year='2010' month='September' />
<abstract><t>This document defines the semantics for grouping the associated source and FEC-based (Forward Error Correction) repair flows in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).  The semantics defined in this document are to be used with the SDP Grouping Framework (RFC 5888). These semantics allow the description of grouping relationships between the source and repair flows when one or more source and/or repair flows are associated in the same group, and they provide support for additive repair flows.  SSRC-level (Synchronization Source) grouping semantics are also defined in this document for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using SSRC multiplexing. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
