<abstract><t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) associates a "responsible" identity with a message and provides a means of verifying that the association is legitimate.[I-D.ietf-dkim-base]. DKIM defines a domain-level authentication framework for email using public-key cryptography and key server technology to permit verification of the source and contents of messages by either Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) or Mail User Agents (MUAs). The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus proving and protecting message sender identity and the integrity of the messages they convey while retaining the functionality of Internet email as it is known today. Proof and protection of email identity, including repudiation and non-repudiation, may assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing". This document provides an overview of DomainKeys Identified Mail and how it can fit into overall messaging systems, how it relates to other IETF message signature technologies, implementation and migration considerations, and outlines potential DKIM applications and future extensions.</t></abstract>
