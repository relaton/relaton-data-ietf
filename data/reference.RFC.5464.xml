<abstract><t>The METADATA extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol permits clients and servers to maintain &quot;annotations&quot; or &quot;metadata&quot; on IMAP servers.  It is possible to have annotations on a per-mailbox basis or on the server as a whole.  For example, this would allow comments about the purpose of a particular mailbox to be &quot;attached&quot; to that mailbox, or a &quot;message of the day&quot; containing server status information to be made available to anyone logging in to the server.
