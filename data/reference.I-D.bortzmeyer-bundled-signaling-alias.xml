<abstract><t>This document suggests a light-weight and semantics-free way to signal, in the DNS itself, that a domain name is actually an alias of another one (and therefore that they are member of the same bundle).  REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: this document should be discussed in the dnsbundled maiing list &lt;https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/ bundled-domain-names>.  The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently kept at Github [1].</t></abstract>
