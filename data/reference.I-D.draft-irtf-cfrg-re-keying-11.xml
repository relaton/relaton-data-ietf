<abstract><t>A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when encryption is performed under a single key.  This amount is called "key lifetime".  This specification describes a variety of methods to increase the lifetime of symmetric keys.  It provides two types of re-keying mechanisms based on hash functions and on block ciphers, that can be used with modes of operations such as CTR, GCM, CBC, CFB and OMAC.</t></abstract>
