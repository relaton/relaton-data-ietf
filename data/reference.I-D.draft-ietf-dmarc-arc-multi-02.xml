<abstract><t>The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol creates a mechanism whereby a series of handlers of an email message can conduct authentication of the email message as it passes among them on the way to its destination.  Initial development of ARC has been done with a single allowed signing algorithm, but RFC 8463 has expanded the supported algorithms.  This specification defines how to extend ARC for multiple signing algorithms.</t></abstract>
