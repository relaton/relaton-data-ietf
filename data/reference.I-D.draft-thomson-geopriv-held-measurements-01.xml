<abstract><t>A method is described by which a Device is able to provide measurement data to a LIS within a HELD request.  Measurement information are observations about the position of a Device, which could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment around the LIS.  When a LIS generates location information for a device, information from the device can improve the accuracy of the location estimate.  A basic set of measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.</t></abstract>
