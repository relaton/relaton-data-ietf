<title>Alternative Decision Making Processes for Consensus-Blocked Decisions in the IETF</title>

<abstract><t>This document proposes an experimental set of alternative decision-making processes for use in IETF working groups.  There are a small number of cases in IETF working groups in which the group has come to consensus that a particular decision must be made but cannot agree on the decision itself.  This document describes alternative mechanisms for reaching a decision in those cases.  This is not meant to provide an exhaustive list, but to provide a known set of tools that can be used when needed.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
