<abstract><t>LDP IGP Synchronization ([LDP-IGP-SYNC]) describes a mechanism to prevent black-holing traffic (e.g. VPN) when an interior gateway protocol (IGP) is operational on a link but Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) is not. If this mechanism is applied to broadcast links that have more than one LDP/IGP peer, the cost-out procedure can only be applied to the link as a whole but not an individual peer. When a new LDP peer comes up on a broadcast network, this can result in loss of traffic through other established peers on that network. This document describes a mechanism to address that use-case without dropping traffic. The mechanism does not introduce any protocol changes.</t></abstract>
