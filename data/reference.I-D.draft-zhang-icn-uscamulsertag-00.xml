<abstract><t>Based on the important concepts and research challenges described in RFC 7927, we consider multi-service tagging technology to be an effective name mechanism for audio and video content in ICN. Since audio and video traffic is the primary traffic transmitted over the Internet, it will greatly advance the current Internet architecture to the ICN architecture, the name mechanism for creating audio and video content. This article discusses typical cases of improvements using name mechanisms, including content resource exchange between different ISPs, resource caching of content naming information, and data distribution for different transmission quality requirements in low latency environments.</t></abstract>
