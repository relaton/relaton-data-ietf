<abstract><t>The SIEVE Email Filtering "include" extension permits users to include one SIEVE script inside another. This can make managing large scripts or multiple sets of scripts much easier, as well as supporting common 'libraries' of scripts. Users are able to include their own personal scripts or site-wide scripts provided by the local SIEVE implementation.</t></abstract>
