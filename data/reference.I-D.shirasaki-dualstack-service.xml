<abstract><t>This memo shows an example of how to provide IPv6 / IPv4 dual stack services to home users. In order to simplify user setup, these service should have mechanism to configure IPv6 specific parameters automatically. We focus on two basic parameters, prefix and addresses of IPv6 DNS servers, and specify the way to deliver them to Customer Premises Equipments (CPE) automatically. This memo is a digest of the user network interface specification of NTT communications' dual stack ADSL access service.</t></abstract>
