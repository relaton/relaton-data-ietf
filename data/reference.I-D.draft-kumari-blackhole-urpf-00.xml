<abstract><t>Remote triggered black hole (RTBH) routing is a popular and effective technique for the mitigation of denial of service attacks. This document expands upon destination-based remote triggered black hole routing by outlining a method to enable filtering by source address as well. It also defines a standard BGP community for black hole prefixes to simplify associated semantics.</t></abstract>
