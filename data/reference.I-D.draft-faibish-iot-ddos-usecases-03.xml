<abstract><t>This document specifies several usecases related to the different ways IoT devices are exploited by malicious adversaries to instantiate Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks. The attacks are generted from IoT devices that have no proper protection against generating unsolicited communication messages targeting a certain network and creating large amounts of network traffic. The attackers take advantage of breaches in the configuration data in unprotected IoT devices exploited for DDoS attacks. The attackers take advantage of the IoT devices that can send network packets that were generated by malicious code that interacts with an OS implementation that runs on the IoT devices. The prupose of this draft is to present possible IoT DDoS usecases that need to be prevented by TEE. The major enabler of such attacks is related to IoT devices that have no OS or unprotected EE OS and run code that is downloaded to them from the TA and modified by man-in-the-middle that inserts malicious code in the OS. This draft adds list of MUD files for most IoT devices.</t></abstract>
