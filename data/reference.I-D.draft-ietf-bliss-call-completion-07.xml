<abstract><t>The call completion features allow the calling user of a failed call to be notified when the called user becomes available to receive a call.  For the realization of a basic solution without queueing call- completion requests, this document references the usage of the the dialog event package (defined in RFC 4235) as described as 'automatic redial' in (RFC 5359, SIP Service Examples).  For the realization of a more comprehensive solution with queueing call-completion requests, this document introduces an architecture for implementing these features in the Session Initiation Protocol: "Call completion" implementations associated with the caller's and callee's endpoints cooperate to place the caller's request for call completion into a queue at the callee's endpoint, and, when a caller's request is ready to be serviced, re-attempt the original, failed call.  The deployment of a certain SIP call-completion solution is also dependent on the needed level of interoperability with existing call- completion solutions in other networks.</t></abstract>
