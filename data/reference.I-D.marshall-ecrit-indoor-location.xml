<abstract><t>The application of summoning emergency assistance by using a phone to call 9-1-1 in North America has been ingrained in society for 40+ years.  A successful emergency response to a caller in need, is dependent upon the responders receiving accurate location information to effect timely action.  Traditional wireline telephony is able to utilize the location of the physical wires as a source of information for caller location, whereas wireless technologies require more exotic mechanisms to locate a 9-1-1 caller.  Mechanisms for locating a cellular caller dialing 9-1-1 is based on 20 year old technology, which was designed for outdoor environments, and does not perform sufficiently when used to locate an emergency caller from within a home or office building environment.  With growing trends in mobile cellular usage, large portions of subscribers are relying solely on their mobile phones to make emergency calls.  Emergency response time suffers when that caller is located indoors.  This document defines the problem statement and solutions for expanding the current set of methods used to locate a cellular caller to 9-1-1.  The expansion of the methods includes connections to services that are outside the normal administrative domain of the cellular provider, hence both the privacy and security aspects of connecting these systems are taken into consideration.</t></abstract>
