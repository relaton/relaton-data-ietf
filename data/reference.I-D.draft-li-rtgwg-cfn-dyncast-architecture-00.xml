<abstract><t>Compute First Networking (CFN) Dynamic Anycast refers to in-network edge computing, where a single service offered by a provider has multiple instances attached to multiple edge sites.  In this scenario, flows are assigned and consistently forwarded to a specific instance through an anycast approach based on the network status as well as the status of the different instance.</t><t> This document describes an architecture for the Dynamic Anycast (Dyncast) in Compute First Networking (CFN).  It provides an overview, a description of the various components, and a workflow example showing how to provide a balanced multi-edge based service in terms of both computing and networking resources through dynamic anycast in real time.</t></abstract>
