<abstract><t>It has often been the case that morality has not been given proper consideration in the design and specification of protocols produced within the Routing Area.  This has led to a decline in the moral values within the Internet and attempts to retrofit a suitable moral code to implemented and deployed protocols has been shown to be sub-optimal. </t><t>This document specifies a requirement for all new Routing Area Internet-Drafts to include a &quot;Morality Considerations&quot; section, and gives guidance on what that section should contain.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
