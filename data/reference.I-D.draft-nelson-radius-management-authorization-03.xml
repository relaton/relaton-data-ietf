<abstract><t>This document describes Remote Access Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) attributes for the authorization and service provisioning of local and remote management of embedded systems and other managed entities, generally referred to as Network Access Servers (NASes). Specific provisions are made for remote management via framed management protocols, and for more granular levels of security and command privilege level beyond those included in the base RADIUS specification. Provisions are also introduced for enhancing auditability of individual management operations.</t></abstract>
