<abstract><t>The TCP Window Scale option modifies the interpretation of packets in a flow but is transmitted only at the start of the connection.  As such there is a problem for observability and fault-finding, since a packet capture by a third party may miss the start of a relevant connection.  This document describes the use of TCP options to provide the scale values during a connection.</t></abstract>
