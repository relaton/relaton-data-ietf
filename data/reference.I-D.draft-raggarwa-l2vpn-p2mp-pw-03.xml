<abstract><t>A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) is a mechanism that emulates the essential attributes of a unidirectional P2MP Telecommunications service such as P2MP ATM over a Packet Switched Network (PSN). One of the applicabilities of a P2MP PW is to deliver a Layer 2 multicast service, that carries multicast frames (encoded using Layer 2 or IP mechanisms) from a multicast source to one or more multicast receivers.  [RFC4664] describes a number of different ways in which sets of PWs may be combined together into "Provider Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs" (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs), resulting in a number of different kinds of L2VPN. P2MP PWs enable a L2VPN to provide a Virtual Private Multicast Service (VPMS), which may be in addition to the Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) offered by the L2VPN. A VPMS is a L2VPN service that provides point-to-multipoint connectivity traffic to customers.  VPMS framework and requirements are described in [VPLS-REQ].  One of the VPMS requirements is auto-discovery. This document describes how procedures outlined in [VPLS-MCAST] can be used for auto-discovery (A-D) in VPMS using BGP. This document also describes BGP based procedures for P2MP PW signaling for VPMS that may be used when BGP is used for VPMS auto-discovery.</t></abstract>
