<abstract><t>This specification defines an extensible metadata that may be inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to process those responses.  It is expressed either as a link header, or query parameters.  It will allow the client to learn where the members in the response could be used.  Since it is just additional response header/query parameters, any client that does not understand this extension should not break and work normally while supporting clients can utilize the metadata to take the advantage of the extension.</t></abstract>
