<abstract><t>IETF CCAMP WG has defined a set of extensions to OSPFv2 to support ASON routing requirements.  These extensions have been given EXP status rather than Standards Track and according to guidelines for OSPFv2 have not been allocated standard codepoints by IANA. This work has continued in [OSPFASON].  This draft defines a set of proposed updates for a subset of the the ASON routing extensions for OSPFv2 defined in [OSPFASON]. These proposed updates have already benefited from running code tested in multiple interoperability testing events, with at least eight independent implementations. The differences from [OSPFASON] are the result of field and interoperability testing experience. These formats are proposed to either be folded in to [OSPFASON], or be a separate Standards Track RFC covering a subset of the ASON extensions to OSPFv2, as preferred by the working group. We believe that adopting these formats will help move those parts of [OSPFASON] towards Standards Track, while preserving the functionality defined in [OSPFASON].</t></abstract>
