<abstract><t>The delivery of network services often require service functions and their specific order, called a service function chain (SFC).  A SFC request is usually composed by distributed resources which are expected to available across multiple domains with different technology and/or administration.  This document describes different standardization activities and research projects addressing the challenges posed by SFC across multiple domains (specifically, multiple administrative domains).  In addition, this document presents an initial approach to realize inter-domain service chains leveraging the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol.  Finally, another important concern of this document is to initiate a discussion (ALTO, SFC as well as other WGs) regarding if, how, and under what conditions ALTO can be useful to improve the multi-domain SFC process.</t></abstract>
