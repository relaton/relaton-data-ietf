<abstract><t>Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securing Neighbor Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats.  As defined today, SEND assumes that the node sending a ND message is the owner of the address from which the message is send, so that it is in possession of the private key used to generate the digital signature on the message.  This means that the Proxy ND signaling performed by nodes that do not possess knowledge of the address owner's private key cannot be secured using SEND.  This document extends the current SEND specification in order to support Proxy ND operation.</t></abstract>
