<abstract><t>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme resources transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG-Systems] have been devised in their process of creating standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and the OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and future scheduled publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications such as HTTP, MHP [DVB-MHP], OCAP [OCAP1.0] or other XML based metadata.  These URI are used to locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other multimedia broadcast programme services (i.e., channels or events) and also the audio-visual components related to that programme, for example an HTTP-based programme guide on the Web or other XML-based electronic programme guides in digital broadcast receivers.  This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the Internet community, given its definition as part of the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.</t></abstract>
