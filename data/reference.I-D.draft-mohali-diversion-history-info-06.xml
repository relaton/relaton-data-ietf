<abstract><t>Although the SIP History-Info header is the solution adopted in IETF, the non-standard Diversion header is nevertheless widely implemented and used for conveying call diversion related information in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling. This document describes a recommended interworking guideline between the Diversion header and the History-Info header to handle call diversion information.  In addition, an interworking policy is proposed to manage the headers coexistence.  The History-Info header is described in [RFC4244] and the non-standard Diversion header is described, as Historic, in the [RFC5806].  Since the Diversion header is used in many existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is needed.</t></abstract>
