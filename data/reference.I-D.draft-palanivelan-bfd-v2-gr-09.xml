<abstract><t>This document is a historical record of some work and discussions in the bfd working group on a possible solution to the Graceful Restart issues with BFD.  To keep the protocol simple, it was decided not to include this extension in the BFD standard.  This document describes in detail the challenges to BFD in surviving a graceful restart, and a generic solution to such challenges as proposed and discussed in the working group.</t></abstract>
