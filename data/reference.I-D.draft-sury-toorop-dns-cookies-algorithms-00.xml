<abstract><t>[RFC7873] left the construction of Server Cookies to the discretion of the DNS Server (implementer) which has resulted in a gallimaufry of different implementations.  As a result, DNS Cookies are impractical to deploy on multi-vendor anycast networks, because the Server Cookie constructed by one implementation cannot be validated by another.  This document provides precise directions for creating Server Cookies to address this issue.  Furthermore, [FNV] is obsoleted as a suitable Hash function for calculating DNS Cookies.  [SipHash-2.4] is introduced as a new REQUIRED Hash function for calculating DNS Cookies.  This document updates [RFC7873]</t></abstract>
