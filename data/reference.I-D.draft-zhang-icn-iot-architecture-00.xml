<abstract><t>Internet of Things (IoT) promises to connect billions of objects to Internet.  After deploying many stand-alone IoT systems in different domains, the current trend is to develop a unified de-fragmented IoT platform so that objects can be made accessible to applications across organizations and domains.  Towards this goal, quite a few proposals have been made to build a unified IoT platform as an overlay on top of today's Internet.  Such overlay solutions, however, are inadequate to address the important challenges posed by a unified IoT system, especially in terms of mobility, scalability, and communication reliability, due to the inherent inefficiencies of the current Internet.  To address this problem, we propose to build a unified IoT platform based on the Information Centric Network (ICN) architecture, which we call ICN-IoT [20].  ICN-IoT leverages the salient features of ICN, and thus provides seamless device-to-device (D2D) communication, mobility support, scalability, and efficient content and service delivery leveraging in-network computing, caching and storage.  This draft begins by motivating the need for an unified ICN-IoT platform to connect heterogenous IoT systems.  We then propose an ICN-IoT system architecture and middleware components which includes device/network-service discovery, naming service, IoT service discovery, contextual processing, pub/sub management to support efficient naming, data discovery, data processing and data distribution.</t></abstract>
