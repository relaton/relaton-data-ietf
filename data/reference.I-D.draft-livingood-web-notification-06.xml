<abstract><t>The objective of this document is to describe one method of providing notifications to web browsers that has been deployed by Comcast, an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Such a notification system can be used by an ISP to provide near-immediate notifications to their users, such as to warn them that their traffic exhibits patterns that are indicative of malware or virus infection, for example.  There are other proprietary systems that can perform such notifications but these systems utilize Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology.  This document describes one example of a system that does not rely upon DPI, and is instead based in open standards and open source applications.  While the system described herein is in some ways specific to the Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) networks used by most cable-based broadband ISPs, components and concepts described in this document could generally be applied to many different types of networks.</t></abstract>
