<abstract><t>RFC 2916 assigned responsibility for a number of administrative and operational details of Telephone Number Mapping (ENUM) to the IAB.  It also anticipated that ITU would take responsibility for determining the legitimacy and appropriateness of applicants for delegation of &quot;country code&quot;-level subdomains of the top-level ENUM domain.  Recently, three memos have been prepared for the ITU-T Study Group 2 (SG2) to explain the background of, and reasoning for, the relevant decisions.  The IAB has also supplied a set of procedural instructions to the RIPE NCC for implementation of their part of the model.  The content of the three memos is provided in this document for the information of the IETF community.</t></abstract>
