<abstract><t>This document specifies how to establish a media session which represents a virtual private network using Session Initiation Protocol for the purpose of on-demand media/application sharing between peers.  It extends the protocol identifier of Session Description Protocol (SDP) so that it can negotiate the use of Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) for media sessions in the SDP offer/answer model.  It also specifies a method to boot up IKE and generate IPsec security associations using a self-signed certificate under the mechanism of connection-oriented media transport over the Transport Layer Security in the SDP (comedia-tls).  This document extends RFC 4572.  In addition, it defines a new attribute "udp- setup", which is similar to the "setup" attribute defined in RFC 4145, to enable endpoints to negotiate their roles in an IKE session. To use pre-shared keys for authentication in IKE, a new attribute "psk-fingerprint" is also defined.</t></abstract>
