<abstract><t>Some Relay Agents extract lease information from the DHCP message exchanged between the client and DHCP server.  This lease information is used by relay agents for various purposes like antispoofing, prevention of flooding.  RFC 4388 defines a mechanism for relay agents to retrieve the lease information from the DHCP server as and when this information is lost.  Existing leasequery mechanism is data driven which means that a relay agent can initiate the leasequery only when it starts receiving data from/to the clients. In certain scenarios, this model is not scalable. This document first looks at issues in existing mechanism and then proposes new query types, query by remote ID and query by circuit ID, to address these issues.</t></abstract>
