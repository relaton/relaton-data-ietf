<abstract><t>The Internet model has traditionally avoided the complication of an explicit session layer, in favor of having applications and transports divide the relevant work between them.  While this has been a successful strategy when the packet flows from two hosts all take the same path, there may be advantages in using a session-layer strategy when a host initiates related flows from multiple interfaces in independent routing domains (e.g. a 3G or 4G interface and a WiFi interface).  This draft discusses an approach re-using the security association mechanisms present in DTLS [RFC4347] to create a simple session layer.</t></abstract>
