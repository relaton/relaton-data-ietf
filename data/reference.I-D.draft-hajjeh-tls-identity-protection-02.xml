<abstract><t>TLS defines several ciphersuites providing authentication, data protection and session key exchange between two communicating entities. Some of these ciphersuites are used for completely anonymous key exchange, in which neither party is authenticated. However, they are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and are therefore deprecated. This document defines a set of ciphersuites to add client credential protection to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</t></abstract>
