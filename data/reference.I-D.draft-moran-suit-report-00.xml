<abstract><t>The Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT) manifest provides a way for many different update and boot workflows to be described by a common format.  However, this does not provide a feedback mechanism for developers in the event that an update or boot fails.  This specification describes a lightweight feedback mechanism that allows a developer in possession of a manifest to reconstruct the decisions made and actions performed by a manifest processor.</t></abstract>
