<abstract><t>The rapid increase in the amount and type of traffic makes it significantly more challenging for operational and management applications to maintain the network and deploy new services. This is the root cause of one of the major challenges that network operators (service providers, SME, etc) are facing today. The operators are obliged to create a simplified view of their network infrastructure that can help network engineers to use such a simplified model rather than manipulating individual devices. In this context, providing network operators with a set of standard generic YANG-based data models that enable management and automation of services on their network is essential. This document describes what has to be addressed in order to equip service providers with the means to quickly and dynamically create/query/scale/update/delete the services they want to offer. This may include a variety of different service enabling scenarios and in particular VPN management within a data center or among a set of physical or virtualized data centers that belong to an organization or different organizations.</t></abstract>
