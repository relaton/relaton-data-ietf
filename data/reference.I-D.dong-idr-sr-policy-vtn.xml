<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting of one or more segment lists and the associated information.  The header of a packet steered in an SR Policy is augmented with an ordered list of segments associated with that SR Policy.  In scenarios where multiple Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs) exist in the network, the VTN in which the SR policy is instantiated may also need to be specified, so that the header of packet can also be augmented with the information associated with the VTN.  An SR Policy candidate path can be distributed using BGP SR Policy.  This document defines extensions to BGP SR policy to specify the VTN associated with the SR policy.</t></abstract>
