<abstract><t>This document describes the Service Orchestration Protocol (SOP) message flows for some important service orchestration scenarios. The flows contain complete packet information including both SOP and Service Description Framework (SDF) payloads. The message flows in this document are by no means exhaustive, but they carry sufficient information using which other flows can be easily constructed. The deployment scenarios for services are varied, and it is not possible to cover every possible scenario. Nevertheless, those flows will follow closely the information given in this document.</t></abstract>
