<abstract><t>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol supports the retrieval of core identity resources such as users and groups.  In order to avoid overwhelming the SCIM client or service provider, SCIM defines index and count pagination query parameters that can be used "page through" large numbers of resources.  For some SCIM service providers there are advantages in implementing cursor- based pagination as an alternative to index-based pagination.  This document defines a simple extension to the SCIM protocol and core schema to assure interoperability of SCIM implementations that need to realize the advantages cursor-based pagination.</t></abstract>
