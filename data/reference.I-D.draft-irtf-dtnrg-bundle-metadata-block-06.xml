<abstract><t>This document defines an extension block that may be used with the DTN Bundle Protocol.  This Metadata Extension Block is designed to carry additional information that DTN nodes can use to make processing decisions regarding bundles, such as deciding whether to store a bundle or determining to which nodes to forward a bundle. The metadata that is carried in a metadata block must be formatted according to the metadata type that is identified in the block's metadata type field.  One specific metadata type, for carrying URIs as metadata, is defined in this document.  Other metadata types may be defined in separate documents.  This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.</t></abstract>
