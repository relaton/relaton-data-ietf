<abstract><t>This document defines the Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) framework, which provides header compression and fragmentation functionality.  SCHC has been tailored for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN).  SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored in both LPWAN devices and in the network sides.  This document defines SCHC header compression mechanism and its deployment for IPv6/UDP headers. This document also specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism that is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the LPWAN technologies.  The Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when it has not been possible to apply such compression, still exceed the layer two maximum payload size.  The SCHC header compression mechanism is independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which it will be used.  Note that this document defines generic functionalities and advisedly offers flexibility with regard to parameters settings and mechanism choices, that are expected to be made in other technology-specific documents.</t></abstract>
