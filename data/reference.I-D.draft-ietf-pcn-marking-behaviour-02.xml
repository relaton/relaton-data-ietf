<abstract><t>This document standardises the two marking behaviours of PCN-nodes: threshold marking and excess traffic marking.  Threshold marking marks all PCN-packets if the PCN traffic rate is greater than a configured rate ("PCN-threshold-rate").  Excess traffic marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the amount marked equals the traffic rate in excess of a configured rate ("PCN-excess-rate"). Setting the configured rates below the physical link rates enables PCN-nodes to provide information to support admission control and flow termination in order to protect the quality of service of established inelastic flows.</t></abstract>
