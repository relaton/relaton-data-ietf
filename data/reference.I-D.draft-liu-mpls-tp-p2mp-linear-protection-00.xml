<abstract><t>In MPLS-TP requirement document(rfc5654), there is a requirement to support 1+1 and 1:n linear protection for p2mp connectivity.  The requirement was descirbled in MPLS-TP Survivability Framework document(RFC 6372).  The basic protocol for linear protection was specified in the MPLS-TP Linear Protection document [RFC 6378] but is limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection for p2p connectivity. in addtion, The 1:N protection in which all of working transport paths and the protection path have the same end points was specified in MPLS-TP 1:N protection document(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection).This document applies the existing PSC(RFC 6378) and extensive PSC protocol(draft-ietf-mpls-tp-1toN-protection) to support scenarios of protecting the p2mp path by extending the existing p2p linear protection mechanism. .  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t></abstract>
