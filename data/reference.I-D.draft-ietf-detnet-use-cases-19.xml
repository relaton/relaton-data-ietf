<abstract><t>This draft presents use cases from diverse industries which have in common a need for "deterministic flows".  "Deterministic" in this context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded latency, and other properties germane to the transport of time- sensitive data.  These use cases differ notably in their network topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad industry context for DetNet.  For each use case, this document will identify the use case, identify representative solutions used today, and describe potential improvements that DetNet can enable.  The Use Case Common Themes section then extracts and enumerates the set of common properties implied by these use cases.</t></abstract>
