<abstract><t>Trust routers form an integral part of the ABFAB infrastructure for determining routes between IdPs and RPs and determining CoI membership. Since it is inherent in their name that they are to be trusted, this Internet Draft specifies a trust model for their operation, so that IdPs and RPs can rely on them to perform the tasks that they are trusted to perform.
