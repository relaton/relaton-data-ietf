<abstract><t>The IPsec protocol suite is widely used for business-critical network traffic.  In order to make IPsec deployments highly available, more scalable, and failure-resistant, they are often implemented as IPsec High Availability (HA) clusters.  However, there are many issues in IPsec HA clustering, and in particular in Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) clustering.  An earlier document, &quot;IPsec Cluster Problem Statement&quot;, enumerates the issues encountered in the IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster environment.  This document resolves these issues with the least possible change to the protocol.</t><t>This document defines an extension to the IKEv2 protocol to solve the main issues of &quot;IPsec Cluster Problem Statement&quot; in the commonly deployed hot standby cluster, and provides implementation advice for other issues.  The main issues solved are the synchronization of IKEv2 Message ID counters, and of IPsec replay counters.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
