<abstract><t>This document describes previous efforts and their deployment legacy and the requirements for a successful email security infrastructure. A gap analysis is performed and the tasks divided into problems that are generally considered solved albeit possibly requiring improved execution and problems that may be regarded as research.  This division of the problem space into 'execution' and 'research' portions allows different groups of developers to address each independently and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. A testbed for development and early adopter deployment that achieves this separation is described.</t></abstract>
