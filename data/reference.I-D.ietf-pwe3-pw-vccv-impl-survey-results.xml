<abstract><t>Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate the use of the Control Word (CW) in order to better emulate the services for which the encapsulations have been defined.  However, some encapulations treat the Control Word as optional.  As a result, implementations of the CW, for encapsulations for which it is optional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model and service provider network.  Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity Verification (CV) Types.  This flexibility has led to reports of interoperability issues within deployed networks and associated drafts to attempt to remedy the situation.  This survey of the PW/VCCV user community was conducted to determine implementation trends.  The survey and results is presented herein.</t></abstract>
