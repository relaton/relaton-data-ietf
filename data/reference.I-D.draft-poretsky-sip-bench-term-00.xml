<abstract><t>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking SIP performance in networking devices. Terms are included for test components, test setup parameters, and performance benchmark metrics for black-box benchmarking of SIP networking devices. The Performance Benchmark Metrics are obtained for the SIP Control Plane and Media Plane. The terms are intended for use in a companion Methodology document for complete performance characterization of a device in a variety of network conditions making it possible to compare performance of different devices. It is critical to provide Test Setup Parameters and a Methodology document for SIP performance benchmarking because SIP allows a wide range of configuration and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements. Benchmarks can be applied to a variety of SIP networking device including SIP Servers, Session Border Controllers (SBCs), and Security Gateways (SEGs) as a DUT or in combination as a SUT.</t></abstract>
