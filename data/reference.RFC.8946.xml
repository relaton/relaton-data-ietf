<title>Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) Extension for Diverted Calls</title>
<author initials='J.' surname='Peterson' fullname='J. Peterson'><organization /></author>
<date year='2021' month='February' />
<abstract><t>The Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) is specified in RFC 8225 to convey cryptographically signed information about the people involved in personal communications. This document extends PASSporT to include an indication that a call has been diverted from its original destination to a new one. This information can greatly improve the decisions made by verification services in call forwarding scenarios. Also specified here is an encapsulation mechanism for nesting a PASSporT within another PASSporT that assists relying parties in some diversion scenarios.</t><t>This document updates RFC 8224.</t></abstract>
