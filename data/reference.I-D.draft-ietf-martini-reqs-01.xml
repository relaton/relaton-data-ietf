<abstract><t>This document states requirements for a standardized SIP registration mechanism for multiple addresses of record, the mechanism being suitable for deployment by SIP service providers on a large scale in support of small to medium sized PBXs.  The requirements are for a solution that can, as a minimum, support AORs based on E.164 numbers.  This work is being discussed on the martini@ietf.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
