<abstract><t>The Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms.  This document updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in &quot;Generic Security Service API Version 2: Java Bindings Update&quot; (RFC 5653).  This document obsoletes RFC 5653 by adding a new output token field to the GSSException class so that when the initSecContext or acceptSecContext methods of the GSSContext class fail, it has a chance to emit an error token that can be sent to the peer for debugging or informational purpose.  The stream-based GSSContext methods are also removed in this version.</t><t>The GSS-API is described at a language-independent conceptual level in &quot;Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2,                   Update 1&quot; (RFC 2743).  The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis.  Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS-API are &quot;The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism (SPKM)&quot; (RFC 2025) and &quot;The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service                        Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Mechanism: Version 2&quot; (RFC 4121).</t></abstract>
