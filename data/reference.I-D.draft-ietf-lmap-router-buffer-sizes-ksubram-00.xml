<abstract><t>This draft identifies the set of data that needs to be collected, and analyzed to quantify router buffer sizes used in routers in the Wide Area Network (WAN).  The scope of this draft is limited to WAN links that have link latencies of 40 to 150 milliseconds.  Reducing router buffer sizes has many advantages, the most important being cost.  However, there is not much data available today to effectively calculate this.  This draft details use cases for the study, and lists data that needs to be taken into consideration to be able to quantify the size of router buffers.  The details of the individual measurement metrics are beyond the scope of this document. Neither does the draft identify methods to gather the data.  What it identifies is a need to be able to collect, and report this empirical data in a readable fashion thus providing the ability to study and compare data in a more standardized method.</t></abstract>
