<abstract><t>Internet Protocol security mechanisms, such as IP Security (IPsec) [IPSEC], provides various security services for IP traffic. However, the benefits offered by IPsec come at the cost of increased overhead. This document identifies a set of work items that need to be completed to achieve the integration of header compression (HC) over IPsec (HCoIPsec). HCoIPsec proposes to reduce the amount of packet overhead associated with the transmission of traffic over tunnel mode security associations.</t></abstract>
