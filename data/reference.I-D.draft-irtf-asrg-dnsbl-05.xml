<abstract><t>The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has led to the creation of shared blacklists and whitelists of IP addresses or domains.  The DNS has become a de-facto standard method of distributing these blacklists and whitelists.  This memo documents the structure and usage of DNS based blacklists and whitelists, and the protocol used to query them.
