<abstract><t>This draft defines a method (serve-stale) for recursive resolvers to use stale DNS data to avoid outages when authoritative nameservers cannot be reached to refresh expired data.  One of the motivations for serve-stale is to make the DNS more resilient to DoS attacks, and thereby make them less attractive as an attack vector.  This document updates the definitions of TTL from RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 so that data can be kept in the cache beyond the TTL expiry, updates RFC 2181 by interpreting values with the high order bit set as being positive, rather than 0, and suggests a cap of 7 days.</t></abstract>
