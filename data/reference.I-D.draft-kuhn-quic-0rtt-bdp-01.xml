<abstract><t>0-RTT is designed to accelerate the egress throughput at the establishment of a connection.  There are cases where 0-RTT alone does not improve the time-to-service.  This memo discusses a solution where a fundamental characteristic of the path is learned during the 1-RTT phase and shared with the 0-RTT phase to accelerate the initial throughput during subsequent 0-RTT connections.</t></abstract>
