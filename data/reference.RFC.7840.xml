<abstract><t>For cases where location servers have access to emergency routing information, they are able to return routing information with the location information if the location request includes a request for the desired routing information.  This document specifies an extension to the HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) protocol that updates RFC 5985 to support this function.  Allowing location and routing information to be acquired in a single request response exchange updates RFC 6881, as current location acquisition and route determination procedures are separate operations.</t></abstract>
