<abstract><t>This RFC specifies the ARPANET 1822L Host Access Protocol, which is a    successor to the existing 1822 Host Access Protocol.  1822L allows    ARPANET hosts to use logical names as well as 1822's physical port    locations to address each other.  This RFC is also being presented as    a solicitation of comments on 1822L, especially from host network    software implementers and maintainers.  Obsoletes RFC 802.</t></abstract>
