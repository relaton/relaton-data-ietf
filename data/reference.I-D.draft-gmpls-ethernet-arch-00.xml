<abstract><t>There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilities of Ethernet switches. As a consequence, the role of Ethernet is rapidly expanding into "transport networks" that previously were the domain of other technologies such as SONET/SDH TDM and ATM. This document defines an architecture and framework for a GMPLS based control plane for Ethernet in this "transport network" capacity. GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies. Some additional extensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed and this document provides a framework for these extensions.Contents</t></abstract>
