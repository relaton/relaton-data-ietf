<abstract><t>This document introduces SARP, an architecture that uses proxy gateways and allows to scale data center networks. SARP is based on fast proxies that significantly reduce switches' FDB (MAC table) sizes and ARP/ND impact on network elements in an environment that hosts within one subnet (or VLAN) can spread over various locations. SARP supports smooth and fast virtual machine (VM) mobility without any modification to the VM, while keeping the connection up and running efficiently.  SARP is targeted for massive scaling data centers with a significant number of VMs that can move across various physical locations.</t></abstract>
