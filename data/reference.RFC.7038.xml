<abstract><t>RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of type MANET.  This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR (MANET Designated Router) in a single-hop broadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET in which each router is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router.  Unlike an OSPF broadcast interface, such an interface can have a different cost associated with each neighbor.  The document includes configuration recommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single-hop broadcast networks.</t></abstract>
