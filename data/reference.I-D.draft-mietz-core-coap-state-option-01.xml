<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices which are often equipped with sensors measuring a physical phenomenon such as temperature on a precise scale.  These sensor values are made available by a resource on the CoAP endpoint.  However, for many applications it is not necessary to have the full precision a sensor can provide.  It's often even enough to only have some high-level states instead of raw values.  This document presents a new option for CoAP to dynamically create new resources for a sensor which provides user-defined high-level states instead of raw sensor values.</t></abstract>
