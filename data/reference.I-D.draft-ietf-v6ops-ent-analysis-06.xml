<abstract><t>This document analyzes the transition to IPv6 in enterprise networks. These networks are characterized as a network that has multiple internal links, one or more router connections, to one or more Providers, and is managed by a network operations entity. The analysis will focus on a base set of transition notational networks and requirements expanded from a previous Enterprise Scenarios document. Discussion is provided on a focused set of transition analysis required for the enterprise to transition to IPv6, assuming a Dual-IP layer (IPv4 and IPv6) network and node environment, within the enterprise. Then a set of transition mechanisms are recommended for each notational network.</t></abstract>
