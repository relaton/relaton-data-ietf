<abstract><t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification [Gun2008] describes a network based mobility management protocol which provides IP mobility service to a host in a way which is transparent to the host itself. This document analyses the scenario in which the MN equipped with multiple network interfaces roams in a netlmm domain consisting of several access networks. If the MN wants to preserve IP session continuity across different network interfaces as it moves from one access network to another it needs to be enhanced with a new, netlmm-specific functionality.</t></abstract>
