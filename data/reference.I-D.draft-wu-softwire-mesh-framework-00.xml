<abstract><t>The softwires mesh problem identfies a requirement for a generalized, network-based client IP(x)-over-backbone IP(y) solution in support of the transition to IPv6. Connectivity between islands of IPv6, IPv4 or IPv6/v4 networks will be enabled across a single IPv4 or IPv6 backbone network employing IP (or MPLS) tunnels called softwires. This solution will re-use where appropriate existing multi-address family routing mechanisms such as the Border Gateway Protocol as well as existing IP (and label) tunnel encapsulation schemes. The intent is to encourage multiple, inter-operable vendor implementations in the hope operators will find it easier and more attractive to support the transition to IPv6.</t></abstract>
