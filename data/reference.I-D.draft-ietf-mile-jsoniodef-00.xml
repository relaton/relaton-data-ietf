<abstract><t>RFC 7970 [RFC7970] provides XML-based data representation on incident information, but the use of the IODEF data model is not limited to XML.  JSON representation is sometimes preferred since it is easy to handle from certain programming environments.  This draft represents the IODEF data model in JSON.  Note that this 00 version draft is prepared for the purpose of encouraging discussion on the need for JSON representation.</t></abstract>
