<abstract><t>This document presents a set of requirements for providing an unidirectional Point-to-Multipoint PWE3 (Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge) emulation. The requirements identified in this document are related to architecture, signaling and maintenance aspects of a Point-to-Multipoint PW operation. They are proposed as guidelines for the standardization of such mechanisms. Among other potential applications Point-to-Multipoint PWs SHOULD be used to optimize the support of multicast services as defined in the Layer 2 Virtual Private Network working group.</t></abstract>
