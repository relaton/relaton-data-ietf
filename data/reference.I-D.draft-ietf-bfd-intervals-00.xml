<abstract><t>Some BFD implementations may be restricted to only support several interval values.  When such BFD implementations speak to each other, there is a possibility of two sides not being able to find a common interval value to run BFD sessions.  This document defines a small set of interval values for BFD that we call "Common intervals", and recommends implementations to support the defined intervals.  This solves the problem of finding an interval value that both BFD speakers can support while allowing a simplified implementation as seen for hardware-based BFD.  It does not restrict an implementation from supporting more intervals in addition to the Common intervals.</t></abstract>
