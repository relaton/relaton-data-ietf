<abstract><t>This documents describes an architecture which can be used to extend MPLS networks to integrate access and aggregation networks into a single MPLS domain ("Seamless MPLS").  The Seamless MPLS approach is   based on existing and well known protocols.  It provides a highly flexible and an scalable architecture and the possibility to integrate 100.000 of nodes.  The separation of the service and transport plane is one of the key elements; Seamless MPLS provides service independent transport and removes the necessarity for service specific configurations in network elements.  This draft describes the deployment of standardized protocols and does not invent any new protocols or defines extensions to existing protocols.</t></abstract>
