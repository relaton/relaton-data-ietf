<abstract><t>This document describes web-based real-time communication use cases. Requirements on the browser functionality are derived from the use cases.</t><t>This document was developed in an initial phase of the work with rather minor updates at later stages.  It has not really served as a tool in deciding features or scope for the WG's efforts so far.  It is being published to record the early conclusions of the WG.  It will not be used as a set of rigid guidelines that specifications and implementations will be held to in the future.</t></abstract>
