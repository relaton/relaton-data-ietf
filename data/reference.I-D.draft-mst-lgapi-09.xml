<abstract><t>This document introduces a command set standard to the web-based "Network Looking Glass" software.  Its purpose is to provide application programmers uniform access to the Looking Glass service and to analyze standardized response.  The interface is supposed to provide the same level of information as web-based interfaces, but in a computer-readable format.</t></abstract>
