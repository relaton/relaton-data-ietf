<abstract><t>While individuals may choose their own Cascading Style Sheet for presenting HTML-formatted RFCs, the default offered by the RFC Editor must meet certain requirements.  This draft describes those requirements and is based on the classes defined in draft-hildebrand- html-rfc.  Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest.</t></abstract>
