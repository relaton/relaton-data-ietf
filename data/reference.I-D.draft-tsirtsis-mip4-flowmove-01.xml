<abstract><t>Mobile IPv4 allows Mobile Nodes (MN) to create mobility bindings between their Home Address (HoA) and their current Care-of Address (CoA) in a Home Agent (HA) so that the HA can redirect traffic for the MN to its current location. This draft extends MIPv4 so that the binding granularity is on a per flow basis. Extensions are defined to allow the registration of multiple CoAs and the definition of individual flows. Individual flows can then be pointed to the registered CoAs.</t></abstract>
