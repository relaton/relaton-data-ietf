<abstract><t>Subnetworks connect routers within a bounded region, and may also connect to other networks including the Internet. These routers forward unicast and multicast packets over paths that span multiple IP- and/or sub-IP layer forwarding hops which may cross links with diverse Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) and introduce packet duplication. This document specifies a Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) that supports simplified duplicate packet detection and accommodates links with diverse MTUs.</t></abstract>
