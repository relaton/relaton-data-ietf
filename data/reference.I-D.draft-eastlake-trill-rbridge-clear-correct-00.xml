<abstract><t>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) standard provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) link state routing and by encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a hop count. Devices that implement TRILL are called RBridges.  Since the TRILL base protocol, RFC 6325, was approved, active development of TRILL has revealed corner cases that could use clarification and a few errors in the original RFC. RFCs 6327, XXXX, and YYYY, provide clarifications with respect to Adjacency, Appointed Forwarders, and the TRILL ESADI protocol. This document provide other known clarifications and corrections and updates RFC 6325.</t></abstract>
