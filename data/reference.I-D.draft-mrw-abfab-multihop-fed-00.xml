<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism for establishing trust across a multihop federation within the Application Bridging for Federation Beyond the Wed (ABFAB) framework.  This document introduces a new ABFAB entity, the Trust Router.  Trust Routers exchange information about the availability of Trust Paths across a multiphop federation.  They can be queried by a Relying Party to obtain the best Trust Path to reach a RADIUS or RADSEC server in a given realm.  They also provide temporary identities that can be used by a Relying Party to traverse a Trust Path.  This document is currently limited to discussing a proposed mechanism to achieve a multihop federation in the ABFAB framework.  Later versions of this document (or companion documents) will describe the protocols and algorithms in more detail.</t></abstract>
