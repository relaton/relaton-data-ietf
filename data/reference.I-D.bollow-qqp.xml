<abstract><t>The QQP protocol specifies a method for transmitting multiple webservice requests and responses between two Hosts. QQP plays the role of transport protocol for the QRPC webservice protocol, similar to how XML-RPC and SOAP often use HTTP over TCP as transport protocol. QQP is called the "Quick Queues Protocol" because it is faster than transmitting XML data via HTTP over TCP for several reasons. QQP is also designed to handle Internet Protocol multihoming, hiding IP address changes from application layer software without need for introducing an additional protocol layer for that purpose.</t></abstract>
