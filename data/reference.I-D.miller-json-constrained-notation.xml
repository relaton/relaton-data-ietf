<abstract><t>This specification addresses the challenges of using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) with constrained devices by providing a standard set of mapping rules to Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) that preserve all semantic information, such that the original JSON string can be identically re-created.  JSON Constrained Notation can also be used by devices as a native data format, which can then be represented as JSON when necessary for diagnostics, compatibility, and ease of integration with higher-level systems.</t></abstract>
