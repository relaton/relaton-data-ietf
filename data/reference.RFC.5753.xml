<abstract><t>This document describes how to use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) public key algorithms in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).  The ECC algorithms support the creation of digital signatures and the exchange of keys to encrypt or authenticate content.  The definition of the algorithm processing is based on the NIST FIPS 186-3 for digital signature, NIST SP800-56A and SEC1 for key agreement, RFC 3370 and RFC 3565 for key wrap and content encryption, NIST FIPS 180-3 for message digest, SEC1 for key derivation, and RFC 2104 and RFC 4231 for message authentication code standards.  This document obsoletes RFC 3278.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
