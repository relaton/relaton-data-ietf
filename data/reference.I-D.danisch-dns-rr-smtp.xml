<abstract><t>This memo introduces a new authorization scheme for SMTP e-mail transport. It is designed to be a simple and robust protection against e-mail fraud, spam, and worms. It is based solely on organisational security mechanisms and does not require but still allow use of cryptography. This memo also focuses on security and privacy problems and requirements in context of spam defense. This document is part of the LMAP work of the Anti-Spam Research Group (ASRG) of the IRTF.</t></abstract>
