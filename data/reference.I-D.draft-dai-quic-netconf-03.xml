<abstract><t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices. At present, almost all implementations of NETCONF are based on TCP based protocol. QUIC, a new UDP-based transport protocol, can facilitate to improve the transportation performance, information security and resource utility when being used as an infrastructure layer of NETCONF. This document describes how to use the QUIC protocol as the transport protocol of NETCONF(It is so called NETCONFoQUIC).</t></abstract>
