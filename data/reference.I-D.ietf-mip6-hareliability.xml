<abstract><t>The home agent can be a single point of failure when Mobile IPv6 and its associated supporting protocols are operated in a system.  It is critical to provide home agent reliability in the event of a home agent crashing or becoming unavailable.  This would allow another home agent to take over and continue providing service to the mobile nodes.  This document describes the problem scope briefly, and provides mechanisms of home agent failure detection, home agent state transfer, and home agent switching for home agent redundancy and reliability.</t></abstract>
