<abstract><t>Is the concept of Domain Names owned by the DNS protocol or does the DNS protocol exist to support the concept of Domain Names?  This question has become pertinent in light of proposals to use Domain Names in protocols in ways incompatible with the DNS protocol and the operational environment built to run the protocol.  This document is intended to help answer this question by presenting a look into the recorded history of relevant Requests for Comments. This document comprises the research and views of the author and has benefited from review and input from many IETF experts, but it does not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF.</t></abstract>
