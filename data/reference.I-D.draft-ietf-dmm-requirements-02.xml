<abstract><t>This document defines the requirements for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) in IPv6 deployments.  The traditionally hierarchical structure of cellular networks has led to deployment models which are in practice centralized.  Mobility management with logically centralized mobility anchoring in current mobile networks is prone to suboptimal routing and raises scalability issues.  Such centralized functions can lead to single points of failure and inevitably introduce longer delays and higher signaling loads for network operations related to mobility management.  The objective is to enhance mobility management in order to meet the primary goals in network evolution, i.e., improve scalability, avoid single points of failure, enable transparent mobility support to upper layers only when needed, and so on.  Distributed mobility management must be secure and compatible with existing network deployments and end hosts.</t></abstract>
