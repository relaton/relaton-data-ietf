<abstract><t>Bump-in-the-Host (BIH) is a host-based IPv4 to IPv6 protocol translation mechanism that allows a class of IPv4-only applications that work through NATs to communicate with IPv6-only peers.  The host on which applications are running may be connected to IPv6-only or dual-stack access networks.  BIH hides IPv6 and makes the IPv4-only applications think they are talking with IPv4 peers by local synthesis of IPv4 addresses.  This document obsoletes RFC 2767 and RFC 3338.
