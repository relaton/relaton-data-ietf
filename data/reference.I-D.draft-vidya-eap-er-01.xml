<abstract><t>The extensible authentication protocol (EAP) is a generic framework supporting multiple types of authentication methods. In the most common deployment scenario, an EAP peer and server authenticate each other through an authenticator; the server sends one of the master session keys to the authenticator so that the peer and the authenticator can establish a security association for per-packet access enforcement. It is desirable to not repeat the entire process of authentication when the peer moves to another authenticator. This document specifies extensions to EAP keying hierarchy and an EAP method-independent protocol to facilitate such efficient Re- authentication between the peer and the server through a new authenticator.</t></abstract>
