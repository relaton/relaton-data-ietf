<abstract><t>Usually network layer security through IPsec is transparent for applications. Usually, they cannot detect the presence of IPsec or affect its security properties. This document specifies extensions to increase the visibility of IPsec to applications through a low level sockets API. In addition, a higher layer APIs based on GSS is also defined. The GSS based APIs increase security level of the application through the dual use of both transport and network layer security. It can be also used to improve protocol performance by reducing redundant authentications.</t></abstract>
