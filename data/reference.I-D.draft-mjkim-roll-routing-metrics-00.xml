<abstract><t>This document specifies routing metrics used in path calculation for Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL).  Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics compared with traditional wired networks or even with similar ones such as mobile ad-hoc networks as indicated in several application-specific requirements documents.  Since typical IGP routing metrics such as hop counts or link metrics are not sufficient for LLNs, this document specifies a new set of required link and node metrics suitable to LLNs.</t></abstract>
