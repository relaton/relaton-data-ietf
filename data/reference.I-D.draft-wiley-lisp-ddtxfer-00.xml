<abstract><t>This draft describes the means for transferring a LISP Delegated Database Tree (LISP-DDT) between DDT nodes and for notifying DDT nodes that the database has changed since it was last transferred. The LISP-DDT is a hierarchical, distributed database that provides delegation of authority for mappings from LISP EIDs to RLOCs.  A DDT node may be delegated authority for an Extended EID-prefix and maintains RLOCs for Map Servers and other DDT nodes to which authority has been delegated for more specific EID-prefixes of the that prefix.  This document does not describe the use of DDT as part of the LISP mapping service.</t></abstract>
