<abstract><t>The target of the DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) system is to provide an open and standard in-network storage system for applications, primarily P2P (peer-to-peer) applications, to store, retrieve and manage their data.  This draft enumerates and explains requirements, not only for storage and retrieval, but also for data management, access control and resource control, that should be considered during the design and implementation of a DECADE- compatible system.  These are requirements on the entire system; some of the requirements may eventually be implemented by an existing protocol with/without some extensions (e.g., a protocol used to read and write data from the storage system).  The requirements in this document are intended to ensure that a DECADE-compatible system architecture includes all of the desired functionality for intended applications.</t></abstract>
