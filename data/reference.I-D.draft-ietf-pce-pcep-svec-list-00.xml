<abstract><t>A Path Computation Element (PCE) performing dependent path computations, for instance calculating a diverse working and protected path do not share common network points, would need to synchronize the computations in order to increase the probability of meeting the working and protected path disjoint objective and network resource optimization objective. When a PCE computes multiple sets of dependent path computation requests concurrently, it is required to use Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) list for association among the sets of dependent path computation requests. This document describes the usage of multiple SVECs in the SVEC list and its processing guideline, for the synchronized computation of dependent paths.</t></abstract>
