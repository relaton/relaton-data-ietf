<abstract><t>In SIP-based networks, a SIP session MAY involve several application servers on the originating and terminating side. In a certain case, an application server need to set some indication in SIP message to indicate next application server, what are allowed and what are not allowed. There is a need to provide indicators for service interaction between SIP application servers or other SIP endpoints. This document describes a mechanism of service interaction indicator for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enhances service interaction between SIP application servers in a trusted network.</t></abstract>
