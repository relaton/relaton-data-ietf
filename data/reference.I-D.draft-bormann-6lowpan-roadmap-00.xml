<abstract><t>6LoWPAN is defined in RFC 4944 in conjunction with a number of specifications that are currently nearing completion.  The entirety of these specifications may be hard to understand, pose specific implementation problems, or be simply inconsistent.  The present guide aims to provide a roadmap to these documents as well as provide specific advice how to use these specifications in combination.  In certain cases, it may provide clarifications or even corrections to the specifications referenced.  This guide is intended as a continued work-in-progress, i.e. a long- lived Internet-Draft, to be updated whenever new information becomes available and new consensus on how to handle issues is formed. Similar to the ROHC implementation guide, RFC 4815, it might be published as an RFC at some future time later in the acceptance curve of the specifications.  This document does not describe a new protocol or attempts to set a new standard of any kind -- it mostly describes good practice in using the existing specifications, but it may also document emerging consensus where a correction needs to be made.  The current version -00 of this document is just an initial draft that is intended to spark the collection of relevant information.</t></abstract>
