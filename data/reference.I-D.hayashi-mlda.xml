<abstract><t>This memo documents a multicast CDN (Content Delivery Network) issues, and describes requirement and discussion points when we solve them. Here, we need a method of precise user accounting (logging) of a user activity to a multicast group and of user access control to a multicast group to protect to subscribe from an illegal access. In this case, it is needed to authorize a user access to a multicast group on the CDN, and to get information of user action (Join/Leave) to a multicast group. The key is how a control process of group membership synchronizes with an AAA process (authentication, authorization and accounting), because we can get a user access information at an AAA server. This depends on the network model of the multicast CDN service. Last of all, we introduce an example of solution MLDA (Multicast Listener Discovery Authentication protocol).</t></abstract>
