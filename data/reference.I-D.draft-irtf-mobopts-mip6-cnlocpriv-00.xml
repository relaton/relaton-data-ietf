<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 does not allow a mobile node to hide its location from a correspondent node without compromising optimized routing.  Hence, a mobile node has the choice: it can either get location privacy support or short packet delay, but not both at the same time.  This document discusses the problem of achieving both simultaneously and specifies a solution.  The solution utilizes the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping mechanisms and does neither introduce new network entities nor changes to home agent or correspondent node implementations.</t></abstract>
