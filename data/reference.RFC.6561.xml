<abstract><t>This document contains recommendations on how Internet Service Providers can use various remediation techniques to manage the effects of malicious bot infestations on computers used by their subscribers.  Internet users with infected computers are exposed to risks such as loss of personal data and increased susceptibility to online fraud.  Such computers can also become inadvertent participants in or components of an online crime network, spam network, and/or phishing network as well as be used as a part of a distributed denial-of-service attack.  Mitigating the effects of and remediating the installations of malicious bots will make it more difficult for botnets to operate and could reduce the level of online crime on the Internet in general and/or on a particular Internet Service Provider's network.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
