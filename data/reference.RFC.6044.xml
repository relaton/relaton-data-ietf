<abstract><t>Although the SIP History-Info header is the solution adopted in IETF, the non-standard Diversion header is nevertheless widely implemented and used for conveying call-diversion-related information in SIP signaling.</t><t>This document describes a recommended interworking guideline between the Diversion header and the History-Info header to handle call diversion information.  In addition, an interworking policy is proposed to manage the headers' coexistence.  The History-Info header is described in RFC 4244 and the non-standard Diversion header is described, as Historic, in RFC 5806.</t><t>Since the Diversion header is used in many existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is needed.  This work is intended to enable the migration from non- standard implementations and deployment toward IETF specification- based implementations and deployment.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
