<abstract><t>This memo describes a proposal to enhance DS-lite solution with an additional feature to ease interconnection between IPv4 and IPv6 realms.  When deployed, no dual-stack-enabled network is required for the delivery of both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity to customers.  Only IPv6 is required to be deployed in core and access networks. Particularly, IPv6 transfer capabilities are used for the transfer of IPv4-addressed packets in a completely stateless scheme between the interconnection segment and the DS-lite CGN node(s).  This memo proposes an IPv4-inferred scheme to build IPv6 addresses.  The proposed solution allows Service Providers to maintain an IPv6- only network.</t></abstract>
