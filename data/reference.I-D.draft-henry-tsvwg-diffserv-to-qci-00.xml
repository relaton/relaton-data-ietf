<abstract><t>As communication devices become more hybrid, smart devices include more media-rich communication applications, and the boundaries between telecommunication and other applications becomes less clear. Simultaneously, as the end-devices become more mobile, application traffic transits more often between enterprise networks, the Internet, and cellular telecommunication networks.  In this context, it is crucial that quality of service be aligned between these different environments.  However, this is not always the case by default, and cellular communication networks use a different QoS nomenclature from the Internet and enterprise networks.  This document specifies a set of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifiers (QCI) to Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) mappings, to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by the 3GPP with the recommendations offered by the IETF, so as to maintain a consistent QoS treatment between cellular networks and the Internet.</t></abstract>
