<abstract><t>This draft discusses extensions to the shim6 architecture to support shim6 proxies that would allow the provision of the following capabilities: o  Provide Upper Layer Identifier portability. o  Provide Traffic Engineering policy enforcement. o  Off-load of the shim6 context management from the actual peers of  the communication. o  Enable legacy IPv6 nodes located in the multihomed site to obtain  full multihoming support (no modification of the end nodes).</t></abstract>
