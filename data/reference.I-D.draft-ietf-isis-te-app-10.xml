<abstract><t>Existing traffic engineering related link attribute advertisements have been defined and are used in RSVP-TE deployments.  Since the original RSVP-TE use case was defined, additional applications (e.g., Segment Routing Traffic Engineering, Loop Free Alternate) have been defined which also make use of the link attribute advertisements.  In cases where multiple applications wish to make use of these link attributes the current advertisements do not support application specific values for a given attribute nor do they support indication of which applications are using the advertised value for a given link.  This document introduces new link attribute advertisements which address both of these shortcomings.</t></abstract>
