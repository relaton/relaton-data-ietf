<abstract><t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as defined in RFC 7049, is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.</t><t>This document makes use of this extensibility to define a number of CBOR tags for typed arrays of numeric data, as well as additional tags for multi-dimensional and homogeneous arrays.  It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.</t></abstract>
