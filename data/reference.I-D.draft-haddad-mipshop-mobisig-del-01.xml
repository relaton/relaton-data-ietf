<abstract><t>This memo describes a mechanism, which delegates the exchange of mobility signaling messages between the mobile node and the correspondent node(s) to the network infrastructure. Goals outlining the proposed delegation are to further reduce the IP handoff latency and to relieve the mobile node from exchanging a considerable amount of signaling messages with the CN(s) while retaining full control on the critical ones.</t></abstract>
