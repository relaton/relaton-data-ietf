<abstract><t>The Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) allows network OAM applications to collect telemetry data about any user packet.  Unlike the E2E and trace modes in in-situ OAM (IOAM), PBT does not require user packets to carry any telemetry data, but directly exports the telemetry data from network nodes to a collector through separated OAM packets called postcards.  Two variations of PBT, PBT-I and PBT-M, are described.  PBT-I requires inserting an instruction header to user packets to guide the data collection.  PBT-I is designed as another mode of IOAM, Per-Hop Postcard (PHP), to complement the existing operational modes of IOAM.  PBT-M only marks the user packets or configure the flow filter to invoke the data collection.  PBT-M also provides a complement to IOAM and address several implementation and deployment challenges of it.</t></abstract>
