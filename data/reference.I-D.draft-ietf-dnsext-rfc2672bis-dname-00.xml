<abstract><t>The DNAME record provides redirection for a sub-tree of the domain name tree in the DNS system. That is, all names that end with a particular suffix are redirected to another part of the DNS. Changes to the DNS protocol since DNAME's introduction has lead to a need to clarify several issues in the DNAME specification. These issues are discussed in this document.</t></abstract>
