<abstract><t>A new architecture of optical transport networks which is addressed in the newest version of G.872 is being developed in ITU-T SG15. Compared with previous G.872 technology, this new technology allows the switch of large chunk of contiguous spectrum which may be wider than the spectrum occupied by a single optical channel signal.  Since current control plane technology isn't able to control this kind of application, this document describes the signaling extension to support the control of this kind of new spectrum utilization and implementation way.  This document also addresses the interworking between WSON optical channel and SSON (Spectrum Switched Optical Network) optical channel.</t></abstract>
