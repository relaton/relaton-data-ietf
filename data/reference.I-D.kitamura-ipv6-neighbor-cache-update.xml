<abstract><t>This document describes IPv6 neighbor cache update methods from external nodes. In current communication environments, using status of IP addresses is frequently changed by several operations, such as disconnecting / connecting nodes to networks at mobile environments, suspending / hibernating / resuming nodes, and consuming large number of IP addresses dynamically when ephemeral address [Ephemeral] function is enabled.  When using status of an IP address is changed from "Used" to "Not Used", its related used resources such as neighbor cache entry should be deleted cooperatively from security enhancement viewpoint and efficient resource management viewpoint.  [RFC4861] defines neighbor discovery methods and describes how to manage neighbor cache entries by neighbor discovery messages. However, [RFC4861] does not define quick and clear neighbor cache update (delete) functions.  In order to meet above request, this document proposes two types of IPv6 neighbor cache update (delete) methods from external nodes. One is a heuristic type method that does NOT require neighbor discovery message extensions. The other is an explicit type method that requires small neighbor discovery message extensions.</t></abstract>
