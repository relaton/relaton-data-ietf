<abstract><t>This document specifies a mechanism for enabling mobile nodes in IPv6 mobile network to perform route optimization. The route optimization is possible because mobile router relays the prefix of its Care-of address to its mobile nodes by playing the role of ND-proxy. Through binding updates associated with the network prefix of an access network, the mobile nodes can perform route optimization. In addition, this document explains how mobile nodes can optimize its DNS name resolution through RA-based DNS discovery. By announcing the address of local recursive DNS server, mobile router allows mobile nodes to optimize their DNS name resolution.</t></abstract>
