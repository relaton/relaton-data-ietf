<abstract><t>The "BTNS" (Better Than Nothing Security) protocols specifies how to use IKEv1 and IKEv2 to do unauthenticated IPsec. This document explains in the abstract (no language bindings are provided) how an application may learn that BTNS IPsec has been applied to a conversation, such that the application can plan to do it's own authentication using a channel binding. In addition, applications can use this API (Application Programming Interface) to request BTNS treatment of the applications' connections.</t></abstract>
