<abstract><t>A low-rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN) is a network designed for low-cost and very low-power short-range wireless communications. It is hard to employ static routes. Route discovery is the procedure whereby network devices cooperate to find and establish routes through the network and is always performed with regard to a particular source and destination device. However, Route discovery in LR-WPAN has lack of authentication mechanism. Also, dynamic network topology makes it arduous to detect malicious nodes. We proposed a secure route discovery authentication mechanism using the •ÏSRD. •ÏSRD uses RREQ ID, destination address and the unique value as input string to generate authentication code (AC). It is used as the authentication between source node and destination node.</t></abstract>
