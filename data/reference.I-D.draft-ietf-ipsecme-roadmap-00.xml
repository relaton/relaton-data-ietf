<abstract><t>Over the past few years, the number of RFCs that define and use IPsec and IKE has greatly proliferated.  This is complicated by the fact that these RFCs originate from numerous IETF working groups: the original IPsec WG, its various spin-offs, and other WGs that use IPsec and/or IKE to protect their protocols' traffic.  This document is a snapshot of IPsec- and IKE-related RFCs.  It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions.  It obsoletes the previous IPsec Document Roadmap [RFC2411].</t></abstract>
