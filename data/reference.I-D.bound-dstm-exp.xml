<abstract><t>In an IPv6 dominant environment, some applications will still require IPv4 addresses to interoperate. Dual stack may be configured on these hosts, but this will imply the configuration of network equipments (such as routers) to proceed IPv4 packets. The Dual Stack IPv6 Dominant Transition Mechanism (DSTM) is based on the use of IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels to carry IPv4 traffic within an IPv6 network and provides a method to allocate a temporary IPv4 address to Dual IP Layer IPv6/IPv4 capable nodes. DSTM is also a way to avoid the use of Network Address Translation for early adopter IPv6 deployment to communicate with IPv4 legacy nodes and applications.</t></abstract>
