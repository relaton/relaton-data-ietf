<abstract><t>The purpose of this informational document is to establish definitions and describe measurement techniques for data center benchmarking, as well as it is to introduce new terminologies applicable to data center performance evaluations. The purpose of this document is not to define the test methodology, but rather establish the important concepts for benchmarking network switches and routers in the data center. Many of these terms and methods may be applicable beyond this publication's scope as the technologies originally applied in the data center are deployed elsewhere.</t></abstract>
