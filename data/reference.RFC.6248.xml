<title>RFC 4148 and the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Registry of Metrics Are Obsolete</title>
<author initials='A.' surname='Morton' fullname='A. Morton'><organization /></author>

<abstract><t>This memo reclassifies RFC 4148, &quot;IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Metrics Registry&quot;, as Obsolete, and withdraws the IANA IPPM Metrics Registry itself from use because it is obsolete.  The current registry structure has been found to be insufficiently detailed to uniquely identify IPPM metrics.  Despite apparent efforts to find current or even future users, no one responded to the call for interest in the RFC 4148 registry during the second half of 2010. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
