<abstract><t>This document tries to propose an architectural framework of the internet in the real IP world. It describes how a three-tier mesh structured hierarchy can be established in a large address space based on fragmenting it into some regions and some sub regions inside each of them. It addresses issues which could be relevant to this architecture in the context of IPv6. It shows how to make a transition from private IP to real IP without making significant changes with the existing network.</t></abstract>
