<abstract><t>This document discusses the architecture and protocol implications of making network initiation support easier with NetLMM. The framework is restricted to inter-technology mobility within a single NETLMM domain. It is proposed to add a new NetLMM message from the LMA to the MAG, which function is to trigger, upon various events, the location registration procedure. Further, it is indicated how to complement NetLMM with 802.21 control mechanisms to achieve adequate network initiation.</t></abstract>
