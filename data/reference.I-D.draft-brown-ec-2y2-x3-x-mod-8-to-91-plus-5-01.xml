<abstract><t>This document specifies a special elliptic curve with complex multiplication (by i) and a compact description (see title).  This curve is recommended for cryptographic use in a strongest-link combination with dissimilar elliptic curves (e.g. NIST P-256, Curve25519, extension-field curves, etc.)  as a defense in depth against an unlikely, unforeseen attack on otherwise preferred elliptic curves.  The curve equation 2y^2=x^3+x is the Montgomery form of a curve y^2=x^3-x in a class of curves y^2=x^3-ax suggested by Miller in the first published paper elliptic curve cryptography, and an endomorphism usable for efficiency, an idea of Koblitz.  The field size 8^91+5 is prime, and is relatively efficient and compactly described for its bit-size (273 bits).  The document specifies some practical details such as: encoding a point (on the curve) into 34 bytes, public key validation, encoding a private key into 34 bytes, and encoding 34 bytes into a point.  The document also provides pseudocode, motivation, and security considerations.</t></abstract>
