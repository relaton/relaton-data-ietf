<abstract><t>Although there have already been many transition solutions and technologies, it is still lack of a complete solution for large scale broadband ISPs based on the network architecture in the real world, with considering service providers' requirements and constraints. This document proposes a transitioning architecture, the FAST6, a fundamental architecture of service provider's broadband network with PPPoE access method that is transitioning to IPv6.  It is based on common broadband network architecture and providing transitioning solutions going through the whole transition period.</t></abstract>
