<abstract><t>The purpose of this document is to define a framework for an Access Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g. a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a multi-service reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related, service-related and Subscriber-related operations. The Access Node Control Mechanism will ensure that the transmission of the information does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather using a direct device-device communication. This allows for performing access link related operations within those network elements, while avoiding impact on the existing OSS systems.</t></abstract>
