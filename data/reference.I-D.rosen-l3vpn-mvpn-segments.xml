<abstract><t>To provide Multicast VPN (MVPN) Service, Service Providers (SPs) need to instantiate multicast tunnels (known as "P-tunnels") that enable the Provider Edge (PE) routers of a given VPN to transmit multicast packets to each other.  Some SPs organize their networks in a hierarchical manner, with the PE routers in "edge areas", and the edge areas connected to each other via a "core area". A P-tunnel that connects PE routers in different edge areas can be thought of as having three segments: a segment through one edge area, a segment through the core area, and a segment through the second edge area. It is desirable to preserve the independence of the core area by allowing it to use a different tunneling technology than that used in the edge areas.  However, it is not desirable for the core area Border Routers (BRs) to participate in the MVPN-specific signaling, or even to have any knowledge of which MVPNs are in the edge areas that attach to it.  This document specifies a simple method for segmenting MVPN P-tunnels at the BRs, subject to these constraints.</t></abstract>
