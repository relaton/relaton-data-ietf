<abstract><t>This document describes how user agents registered in P2PSIP overlay networks can interwork with those in conventional SIP networks. Communications between any two user agents will happen through the SIP protocol and the location of SIP servers will follow the usual procedures. However, interworking in some environments may require the support of additional elements; this document also describes such elements and how to locate them in P2PSIP overlays.</t></abstract>
