<abstract><t>There currently is not a standard mechanism for the reporting of mail system errors except for the limited set offered by SMTP and the system specific text descriptions sent in mail messages.  There is a pressing need for a rich machine readable status code for use in delivery status notifications [DSN].  This document proposes a new set of status codes for this purpose.
