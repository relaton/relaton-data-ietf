<abstract><t>Delegated namespaces underpin almost every Internet-scale system - domain name management, IP address allocation, Public Key Infrastructure, etc. - but are centrally managed by entities with unilateral revocation abilities and no common interface.  This draft specifies a generalized scheme for delegation that supports explicit time-bound guarantees and limits misuse.  Mappings may be secured by any general purpose distributed consensus protocol; clients can query the local state of any number of participants and receive the correct result barring a compromise at the consensus layer.</t></abstract>
