<abstract><t>This document is a collection of minor technical clarifications to the DNSSECbis document set. It is meant to serve as a resource to implementors as well as an interim repository of DNSSECbis errata. An index sorted by the section of DNSSECbis being clarified. A list of proposed protocol changes being made in other documents, such as [RFC4470] and [I-D.ietf-dnsext-nsec3]. This document would not make those changes, merely provide an index into the documents that are making changes.</t></abstract>
