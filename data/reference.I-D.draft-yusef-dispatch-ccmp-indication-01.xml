<abstract><t>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol document defines a way for a client to discover a conference control server that supports CCMP. However, it does not define a way for a client involved in a conference to determine if the conference focus supports CCMP. This information would allow a CCMP-enabled client that joins a conference using SIP to also register for the XCON conference event package and take advantage of CCMP operations on the conference.  This draft describes a few options to address the above limitation with the pros and cons for each approach, and recommends two to be used depending on the need of the UA.</t></abstract>
