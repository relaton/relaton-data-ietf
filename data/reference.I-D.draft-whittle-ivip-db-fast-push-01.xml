<abstract><t>Ivip (Internet Vastly Improved Plumbing) is a proposed map-encap system which is intended to provide a solution for the routing scaling problem - supporting growing numbers of end-user networks with multihoming, traffic engineering and portability, without further growth in the global BGP routing table.  Ivip is also intended to provide other benefits, including a new form of IPv4 and IPv6 mobility and better utilization of IPv4 address space.  To achieve these benefits, Ivip relies on a "fast mapping database push" system, which is required to securely and reliably deliver updates to the mapping database to hundreds of thousands - or potentially millions - of ITRs (Ingress Tunnel Routers) and Query Servers (QSes) all over the Net, ideally within a few seconds.  This ID describes the requirements of such a system and how it could be implemented so as to cope with very large numbers of updates and ITR/QS sites.</t></abstract>
