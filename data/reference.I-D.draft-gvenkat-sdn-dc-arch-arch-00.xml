<abstract><t>This draft describes a distributed Control Element for SDN implementations. This document describes various complexities associated with data-center management on adoption of new technologies in data center networking. While Server vitalization, cloud computing have very much increased the networking complexities while OpenFlow/SDN gives a different perspective which could provide solution.  Network virtualisation is next thing in happening. Traditional methods of managing each data-center element are increasing management complexities. The key to reduce the management complexity, and have automated infrastructure in very highly scaled data center network is to have orthogonal management and control network to the Data network. A distributed CE yet with a single manager orchestrating the networks will give much needed intelligence to OF controller.</t></abstract>
