<abstract><t>In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss, delay and delay variation (jitter) as well as bandwidth usage is a critical measure for Traffic Engineering (TE).  This data provides operators the characteristics of their networks for performance evaluation that is required to ensure the Service Level Agreements (SLAs).  Performance Measurement (PM) mechanisms can be employed to monitor these metrics for TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in real- time.  This document describes Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) extensions for reporting such performance measurements to an Active Stateful PCE.</t></abstract>
