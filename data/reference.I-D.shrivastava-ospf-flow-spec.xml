<abstract><t>This document describes the extensions to the OSPF protocol to distribute the traffic flow specification rules and associated actions.  The notion and principles of operation of the mechanism were initially introduced into the BGP protocol.  The IPv4 part of specification was published in RFC5575 and later the specification was enhanced for IPv6 via draft-raszuk-idr-flow-spec-v6.  The mechanism allows the routing protocol to distribute information about the traffic flows and associated actions such as packet filtering with it.</t></abstract>
