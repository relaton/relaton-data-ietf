<abstract><t>This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defined in RFC 5070 to support the reporting of phishing events, which is a particular type of fraud.  These extensions are flexible enough to support information gleaned from activities throughout the entire electronic fraud cycle -- from receipt of the phishing lure to the disablement of the collection site.  Both simple reporting and complete forensic reporting are possible, as is consolidating multiple incidents.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
