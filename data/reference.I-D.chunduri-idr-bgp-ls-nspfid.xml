<abstract><t>Non Shortest Paths (NSPs) used in routing protocols e.g.  by the link state routing protocols (IS-IS, OSPFv2 and OSPFv3) within IGP topologies.  NSPs help to reduce the data plane path overhead, mitigate from MTU issues as well as performance related issues in certain data planes and allows granular traffic accounting in the network.  NSPs are created locally by operator or can be provisioned through PCE or Yang from outside.  This document describes a mechanism by which NSP information currently active in the network using the BGP routing protocol by defining extensions to BGP Link- state address-family.</t></abstract>
