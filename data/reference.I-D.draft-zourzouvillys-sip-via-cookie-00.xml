<abstract><t>This document addresses a vulnerability in publicly accessible SIP servers (servers includes both UASes and proxies) that enables them to be used as an amplifier in a reflected denial of service attack.  As a proposed solution, a mechanism for stateless cookie exchange between a SIP server and client to ensure that a public SIP server that wishes to accept SIP requests from hosts over datagram can not be used as an amplifier for a denial of service attack.</t></abstract>
