<abstract><t>The application specific routing requirements for Urban Low Power and Lossy Networks (U-L2Ns) are presented in this document. In the near future, sensing and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urban environments so as to improve the citizens' living conditions as well as to monitor compliance with increasingly strict environmental laws. These field nodes are expected to measure and report a wide gamut of data, such as required in smart metering, waste disposal, meteorological, pollution and allergy reporting applications. The majority of these nodes is expected to communicate wirelessly which - given the limited radio range - requires the use of suitable multi-hop routing protocols. The design of such protocols will be mainly impacted by the limited resources of the nodes (memory, processing power, battery, etc) and the particularities of the outdoors urban application scenario. As such, for a wireless roll solution to be competitive with other incumbent and emerging solutions, the protocol ought to be energy-efficient, scalable and autonomous. This documents aims to specify a set of requirements reflecting these and further U-L2Ns tailored characteristics.</t></abstract>
