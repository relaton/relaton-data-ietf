<abstract><t>Transport networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane.  They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources.  These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking.  Abstraction of network resources is a technique that can be applied to a single network domain or across multiple domains to create a single virtualized network that is under the control of a network operator that may be the customer of the operator that actually owns the network resources.  This draft provides a framework for Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN).</t></abstract>
