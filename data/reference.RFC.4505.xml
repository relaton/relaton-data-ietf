<abstract><t>On the Internet, it is common practice to permit anonymous access to various services.  Traditionally, this has been done with a plain-text password mechanism using &quot;anonymous&quot; as the user name and using optional trace information, such as an email address, as the password.  As plain-text login commands are not permitted in new IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.
