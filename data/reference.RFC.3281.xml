<abstract><t>This specification defines a profile for the use of X.509 Attribute Certificates in Internet Protocols.  Attribute certificates may be used in a wide range of applications and environments covering a broad spectrum of interoperability goals and a broader spectrum of operational and assurance requirements.  The goal of this document is to establish a common baseline for generic applications requiring broad interoperability as well as limited special purpose requirements.  The profile places emphasis on attribute certificate support for Internet electronic mail, IPSec, and WWW security applications.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
