<abstract><t>Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing with NAT traversal.  It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated to it by a NAT.  It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs and does not require any special behavior from them.</t><t>STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is a tool to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.</t><t>This document obsoletes RFC 5389.</t></abstract>
