<abstract><t>This document updates the session matching procedure defined in section 7.3 of RFC 4975, so that an MSRP UA only uses the session-id part of the MSRP URI in order to perform the consistency checks.  The update allows intermediate network entities (ALGs) to modify the address information in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute, without the need for the intermediate to terminate and do the correlating modifications in the associated MSRP messages.
