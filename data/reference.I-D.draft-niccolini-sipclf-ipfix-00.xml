<abstract><t>The SIPCLF WG is currently trying to identify file format(s) suitable for its scope as defined in the current charter.  The group has so far received proposals for a text format and an indexed-text format that are going to be soon combined.  Several people believe that IPFIX could be a valid alternative to these two proposals for several reasons detailed in this document.  This document discusses the main advantages related to the usage of IPFIX file format for SIPCLF.  Additionally it gives preliminary indications on the basic set of information elements that would need to be defined by the SIPCLF WG.</t></abstract>
