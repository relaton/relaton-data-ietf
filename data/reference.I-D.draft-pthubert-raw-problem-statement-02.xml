<abstract><t>Due to uncontrolled interferences, including the self-induced multipath fading, deterministic networking can only be approached on wireless links.  The radio conditions may change -way- faster than a centralized routing can adapt and reprogram, in particular when the controller is distant and connectivity is slow and limited.  RAW separates the routing time scale at which a complex path is recomputed from the forwarding time scale at which the forwarding decision is taken for an individual packet.  RAW operates at the forwarded time scale.  The RAW problem is to decide, within the redundant solutions that are proposed by the routing, which will be used for each individual packet to provide a DetNet service while minimizing the waste of resources.</t></abstract>
