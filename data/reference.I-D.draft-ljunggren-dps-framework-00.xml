<abstract><t>This document presents a framework to assist writers of DNSSEC policy and practice statements such as registry managers on both TLD and secondary level, who have deployed DNSSEC.  DNSSEC is a set of security extensions to the DNS that allows validating DNS answers by to establishing a 'chains of trust' from known public keys to the data being validated.  The aim of this framework is to describe an overall policy for serving secured DNS data and key management.  In particular, the framework provides a comprehensive list of topics that potentially (at the writer's discretion) needs to be covered in a DNSSEC policy definition and practice statement.</t></abstract>
