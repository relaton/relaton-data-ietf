<abstract><t>This document describes goals for Localized Mobility Management (LMM) for IP layer mobility, such Mobile IP and Mobile IPv6. These goals are intended to guide the design of a protocol specification for LMM. Localized Mobility Management, in general, introduces enhancements to IP layer mobility protocols to reduce the amount of latency in IP layer mobility management messages exchanged between a Mobile Node (MN) and its peer entities. In addition, LMM seeks to reduce the amount of signaling over the global Internet when a mobile node traverses within a defined local domain. The identified goals are essential for localized mobility management functionality. They are intended to be used as a guide for analysis on the observed benefits over the identified goals for architecting and deploying LMM schemes.</t></abstract>
