<abstract><t>Some legitimate calls are from persons or organizations connecting the callee with weak social ties, such as a restaurant the callee   booked a table on-line.  These legitimate calls are often mistakenly labeled as unsolicited calls at a filtering system which uses the contact list of the callee.  To reduce these false positives during SPIT filtering, we propose two approaches to label incoming calls using cross-media relations from earlier communications.  One approach is that a potential caller offers the callee his contact address(es) which might be used in future calls.  Another is that a callee provides a potential caller with weakly secret information. In order to be identified as someone the callee contacted through other means previously, the caller should convey the information in future calls.</t></abstract>
