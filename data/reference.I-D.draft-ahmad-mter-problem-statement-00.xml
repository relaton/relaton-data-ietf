<abstract><t>The objective of this document is to begin a discussion that will determine the level of interest at the IETF in documenting how multiple recovery techniques can successfully be combined to protect a set of network resources and the various interactions between these recovery techniques. Potential outcome of this work could be to define new MIBs and/or OAM techniques devoted to such interactions.</t></abstract>
