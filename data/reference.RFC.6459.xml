<abstract><t>The use of cellular broadband for accessing the Internet and other data services via smartphones, tablets, and notebook/netbook computers has increased rapidly as a result of high-speed packet data networks such as HSPA, HSPA+, and now Long-Term Evolution (LTE) being deployed.  Operators that have deployed networks based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network architectures are facing IPv4 address shortages at the Internet registries and are feeling pressure to migrate to IPv6.  This document describes the support for IPv6 in 3GPP network architectures.  This document is  not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for  informational purposes.</t></abstract>
