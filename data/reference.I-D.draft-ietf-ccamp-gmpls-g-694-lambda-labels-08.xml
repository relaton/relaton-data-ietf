<abstract><t>Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a consequence new equipment providing lambda switching capability has been developed and is currently being deployed. However, [RFC3471] has defined that a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) "only has significance between two neighbors" and global wavelength continuity is not considered. In order to achieve interoperability in a network composed of next generation lambda switch-capable equipment, this document defines a standard lambda label format, being compliant with either [G.694.1](DWDM-grid) or [G.694.2](CWDM-grid). Moreover some consideration on how to ensure lambda continuity with RSVP-TE is provided. This document is a companion to the Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling. It defines the label format when Lambda Switching is requested in an all optical network.</t></abstract>
