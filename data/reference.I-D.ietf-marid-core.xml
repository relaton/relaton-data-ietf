<abstract><t>Internet mail suffers from the fact that much unwanted mail is sent using spoofed addresses -- 'spoofed' in this case means the address is used without the permission of the domain owner. This document describes the following: mechanisms by which a domain owner can publish its set of outgoing MTAs, mechanisms by which SMTP servers can determine what email address is allegedly responsible for most proximately introducing a message into the Internet mail system, and whether that introduction is authorized by the owner of the domain contained in that email address. The specification is carefully tailored to ensure that the overwhelming majority of legitimate emailers, remailers and mailing list operators are already compliant.</t></abstract>
