<abstract><t>This draft describes an OSPF extension that can dynamically adjust network forwarding behavior based on Application Servers' running status and environment. This feature can greatly improve latency and performance for 5G Edge Computing services.  The extension enables a feature, called soft anchoring, which makes one Application Server at a specific location to be more preferred than others for the same application to receive packets from a specific source (UE).</t></abstract>
