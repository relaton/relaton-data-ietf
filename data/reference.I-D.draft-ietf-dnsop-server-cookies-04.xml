<abstract><t>DNS Cookies, as specified in [RFC7873], are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism that provide limited protection to DNS servers and clients against a variety of denial-of-service and amplification, forgery, or cache poisoning attacks by off-path attackers.  This document provides precise directions for creating Server Cookies so that an anycast server set including diverse implementations will interoperate with standard clients.  This document updates [RFC7873] with  *  suggestions for constructing Client Cookies in a privacy preserving fashion,  *  precise instructions for constructing Server Cookies deprecating the methods described in [RFC7873], and  *  suggestions on how to update a server secret.  An IANA registry listing the methods and associated pseudo random function suitable for creating DNS Server cookies is created, with the method described in this document as the first and as of yet only entry.</t></abstract>
