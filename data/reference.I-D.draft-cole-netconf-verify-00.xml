<abstract><t>This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configuration management protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to perform sets of active tests (i.e., verification) against servers' running configuration over a period of time to afford the client and server a more robust and resilient configuration management capability.  This is of value to commercial enterprise and public networks as well as wireless emergency and military networks.  We propose an initial new NETCONF capability, i.e., verify.  The verify capability is defined in the context of the verify.yang module listed in the appendix of this document.  Associated with the verify operation are various test.yang modules to be defined elsewhere.  However, this document defines a set of interoperability requirements on the development of the test.yang modules in order to be controlled through the verify capability.</t></abstract>
