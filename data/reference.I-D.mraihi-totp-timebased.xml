<abstract><t>This document describes an extension of one-time password (OTP) algorithm, namely the HMAC-Based One-Time Password (HOTP) Algorithm as defined in RFC 4226, to support time-based moving factor.  The HOTP algorithm specifies an event based OTP algorithm where the moving factor is an event counter.  The present work bases the moving factor on a time value.  A time-based variant of the OTP algorithm provides short-lived OTP values, which are desirable for enhanced security.  The proposed algorithm can be used across a wide range of network applications ranging from remote Virtual Private Network (VPN) access, Wi-Fi network logon to transaction-oriented Web applications. The authors believe that a common and shared algorithm will facilitate adoption of two-factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability across commercial and open-source implementations.</t></abstract>
