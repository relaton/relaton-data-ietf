<abstract><t>This document specifies Metalink/HTTP: Mirrors and Checksums in HTTP Headers, a different way to get information that is usually contained in the Metalink XML-based download description format.  Metalink/HTTP describes multiple download locations (mirrors), Peer-to-Peer, checksums, digital signatures, and other information using existing standards for HTTP headers.  Clients can transparently use this information to make file transfers more robust and reliable.
