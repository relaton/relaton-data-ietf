<abstract><t>Currently OSPFv3 uses IPsec for authenticating the protocol packets. There however are some environments (mobile ad-hoc), where IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and this mechanism cannot be used. This draft proposes an alternative mechanism that can be used so that OSPFv3 does not depend upon IPsec for security.</t></abstract>
