<abstract><t>The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular Internet problem:  a backup path for software maintenance of the European sector of the Internet, for use when SATNET is partitioned.  We propose a mechanism, based upon the Source Routing option of IP, to reach European Internet sites via the VAN Gateway and UCL.  This proposal is not intended as a standard at this time.</t></abstract>
