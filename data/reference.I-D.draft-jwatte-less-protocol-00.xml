<abstract><t>Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user shared simulations, are becoming increasingly used for serious work in addition to the traditional uses of research and entertainment. Whereas previous distributed simulation protocols have been designed with narrow, time-definite scope, the LESS (Live Entity State Stream) protocol is designed to allow open-ended join and leave for a multitude of simulation peers.  The LESS protocol specifies how peers of a simulation collaborate and share state to achieve a mutually agreed "collective hallucination," leading to a user-perceivable shared state of a simulated worlds.</t></abstract>
