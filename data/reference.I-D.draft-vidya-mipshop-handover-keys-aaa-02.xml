<abstract><t>This document describes a AAA-assisted key management protocol to generate a handover key between a mobile node (MN) and an access router (AR) for the purpose of securing FMIPv6 signaling messages. As such, it specifies a message exchange between the MN and the AR and assumptions that must hold in order for this protocol to work. The idea is that the key derived between a mobile node and an access router through this protocol can be used in fast handovers.</t></abstract>
