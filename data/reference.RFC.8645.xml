<abstract><t>A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when encryption is performed under a single key.  This amount is called the &quot;key lifetime&quot;.  This specification describes a variety of methods for increasing the lifetime of symmetric keys.  It provides two types of re-keying mechanisms based on hash functions and block ciphers that can be used with modes of operations such as CTR, GCM, CBC, CFB, and OMAC.</t><t>This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</t></abstract>
