<abstract><t>Though both SIP and various peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols have been widely deployed, there is no operational experience with SIP using overlay networks. Also, most p2p networks developed in the research community do not deal with NAT traversal. This document attempts to list the design requirements for a P2PSIP protocol taking into account the experience gained from both the p2p and the SIP communities. Special emphasis has been put on the SIP-DHT interface, on the overlay performance, on NAT traversal and on security.</t></abstract>
