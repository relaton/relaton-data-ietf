<abstract><t>As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are taking the approach of deploying IPv6 only networks, without dual- stack functionality for IPv4.  However, access to IPv4 based services is still an ongoing requirement and approaches such as IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire tunnels are being developed to meet this need.  In order to provision end-user's hosts with the necessary IPv4 configuration, a number of different mechanisms have been proposed. This memo discusses the benefits and drawbacks of each, with the aim of recommending a single approach as the basis for future work.</t></abstract>
