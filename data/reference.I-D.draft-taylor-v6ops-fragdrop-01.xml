<abstract><t>This memo was written to make application developers and network operators aware of the significant possibility that IPv6 packets containing fragmentation extension headers may fail to reach their destination.  Some protocol or application assumptions about the ability to use messages larger than a single packet may accordingly not be supportable in all networks or circumstances.  This memo provides observational evidence for the dropping of IPv6 fragments along a significant number of paths, explores the operational impact of fragmentation and the reasons and scenarios where drops occur, and considers the effect of fragment drops on applications where fragmentation is known to occur, particularly including DNS.</t></abstract>
