<abstract><t>This document defines how to use the WebRTC Data Channel mechanism, together with the Data Channel Establishment Protocol (DCEP) and the SDP-based "SCTP over DTLS" data channel negotiation mechanism, in order to establish a data channel, referred to as CLUE Data Channel, for transporting CLUE protocol messages between two CLUE entities.  The document defines the SCTP considerations specific to a CLUE Data Channel, the SDP Media Description- and SDP dcmap attribute values, and the DCEP procedures for opening, a CLUE Data Channel.  Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol, and the SDP Offer/Answer procedures for negotiating a CLUE data channel, are outside the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
