<abstract><t>This document focuses on use cases and call flows which include the History-Info header field and a SIP Identity header field with a PASSport with a "div" claim in cases of retargeting.  These use cases are derived from those provided in the SIP History-Info call flows document.  The objective is to describe the optimal way to correlate the History-Info header fields with a PASSporT with diversion information to increase the level of confidence in the History-Info header field by the terminating entity making use of the information.</t></abstract>
