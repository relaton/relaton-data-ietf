<abstract><t>This memo provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to the control of wavelength switched optical networks (WSON). In particular we provide control plane models for key wavelength switched optical network subsystems and processes. The subsystems include wavelength division multiplexed links, tunable laser transmitters, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADM) and wavelength converters. Lightpath provisioning, in general, requires the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process. This process is reviewed and the information requirements, both static and dynamic for this process are presented, along with alternative implementation scenarios that could be realized via GMPLS/PCE and/or extended GMPLS/PCE protocols. This memo does NOT address optical impairments in any depth and focuses on topological elements and path selection constraints that are common across different WSON environments. It is expected that a variety of different techniques will be applied to optical impairments depending on the type of WSON, such as access, metro or long haul.</t></abstract>
