<abstract><t>This document presents a taxonomy of "alternative network deployments", and a set of definitions and shared characteristics. This term includes a set of network models emerged in the last decades with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people, following topological, architectural and business models different from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys the infrastructure connecting the households of the users, who pay for it.  Several initiatives throughout the World have built large scale networks that use wireless technologies (including long distance) due to the reduced cost of using the unlicensed spectrum.  Others rely on wired technologies.  Some of these networks are self-organized and decentralized, other ones are based on sharing wireless resources of the users.  The emergence of these networks can be motivated by different causes: Sometimes the reluctance, or the impossibility, of network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas.  In these cases, the networks have self sustainable business models that provide more localised communication services as well as providing Internet backhaul support through peering agreements with traditional network operators.  Some other times, they are built as a complement and an alternative to commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network operators.  The classification considers different existing network models as e.g., community networks, open wireless services, user-extensible services, traditional local ISPs, new global ISPs, etc.  Different criteria are used in order to build a classification as e.g., the ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a community, a company or a local (public or private) stakeholder, etc.  According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind of network is presented, in terms of network characteristics related to architecture, organization, etc.</t></abstract>
