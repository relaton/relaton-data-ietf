<abstract><t>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such as server processes or pieces of information, which are available in several equivalent replicas on different hosts.  This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer filesharing applications.  The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications, which have to select one host out of several candidates for providing a desired resource.  These recommendations shall be based on parameters that affect performance and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the topological distance.  The ultimate goal is to optimize performance (or Quality of Experience) in the application while minimizing resource consumption in the underlying network infrastructure.  This document enumerates an initial set of requirements for ALTO and solicits feedback and discussion.</t></abstract>
