<abstract><t>The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings, and over the past few years several approaches to a better WHOIS have been discussed and proposed.  Among these shortcomings, different registries operate different WHOIS services.  For users this implies that several WHOIS queries to different registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a given resource.  This document describes a proof-of-concept redirection service for RESTful WHOIS queries as implemented by LACNIC.  This service allows users to query a single WHOIS service and be redirected to the authoritative registry.  The main goal of this document is to encourage discussion on the topics of Joint WHOIS services and query redirection in a RESTful WHOIS world.  The solution implemented by LACNIC proposed here applies to numbering resources (IPv4, IPv6 and autonomous system numbers).</t></abstract>
