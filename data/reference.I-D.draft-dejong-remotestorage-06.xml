<abstract><t>This draft describes a protocol by which client-side applications, running inside a web browser, can communicate with a data storage server that is hosted on a different domain name. This way, the provider of a web application need not also play the role of data storage provider. The protocol supports storing, retrieving, and removing individual documents, as well as listing the contents of an individual folder, and access control is based on bearer tokens.</t></abstract>
