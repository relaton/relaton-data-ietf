<abstract><t>It is commonly agreed the continuous increase of routing tables is a sensitive issue which may question the sustainability of the Internet.  This document describes a solution which makes use of multiple paths without inducing drastic increase of routing tables. A constrained procedure to install additional paths in the RIB is described.  Multiple paths are installed according to rules agreed between adjacent peers and also based on external events (e.g., pro- active detection of link congestion).</t></abstract>
