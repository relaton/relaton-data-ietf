<abstract><t>The HTTP Connect method uses back-to-back TCP connections to and from a proxy.  Such a solution takes care of many transport aspects as well as IP Flow related concerns.  With UDP and IP proxying on the other hand, there are several per-packet and per-flow aspects that need consideration to preserve the properties of end- to-end IP/UDP flows.  The aim of this document is to highlight and provide solutions for these issues related to UDP and IP proxying.</t></abstract>
