<abstract><t>Currently IPsec mobility is the purpose of MOBIKE [RFC4555] which is the IKEv2 multihoming and mobility extension.  More specifically, MOBIKE mobility support provides the ability to change the outer IP   address of a tunnel mode Security Association.  On the other hand MOBIKE multihoming support provides the ability of a peer to inform its correspondent that alternate IP addresses may be used if the current IP address does not work any more.  This draft presents requirements to extend mobility and multihoming facilities.  This includes the use of simultaneous IP addresses as well as other IPsec mode like transport mode.</t></abstract>
