<abstract><t>RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7 MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol.  M3UA is designed for SEP-(TDM)-SG-(IP)-IPSEP and IPSEP-(IP)-IPSEP applications, so the network level management function isn't required. SSNM(SS7 Signalling Network Management) messages defined in M3UA are only used for interworking with SS7. RFC 4666 doesn't define IPSEP- IPSTP-IPSEP application of M3UA. The signalling network management function for this application needs to be extended.  Some parts of the specification are unclear,which  may lead to misinterpretations and may weaken interoperability.  This document provides extensions and clarifications to RFC 4666.</t></abstract>
