<abstract><t>In this document, we propose another solution to support Internet connectivity for AODV. In the design of our solution, several important limits of existing solutions are considered. Especially, new route determination and forwarding algorithms are proposed. Proposed route determination algorithm supports dynamic switching between default route and host route in a sender node through which enhanced performance can be achieved under frequent topological changes. And proposed forwarding algorithm supports next hop forwarding for default routes towards multiple gateways.</t></abstract>
