<abstract><t>As of the deprecation of NAT-PT as a mechanism to allow IPv6-only hosts to connect to IPv4-only hosts, there is no longer a viable way to provide interoperation between IPv4-only and IPv6-only hosts connected to the internet. This document outlines a way to use the HTTP CONNECT method (better known as HTTPS proxying) to accomplish this interoperation for a large (but not the full) set of IP applications. The intent is to provide a base level usability for IPv6-only hosts to remove the need to provide IPv4 connectivity in all cases.</t></abstract>
