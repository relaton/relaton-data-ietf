<abstract><t>This specification defines a document format that can be used to indicate that a change has occurred in a document managed by the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP).  This format indicates the document that has changed and its former and new entity tags.  It also can indicate the specific change that was made in the document, using an XML patch format.  This format allows also indications of element and attribute content of an XML document.  XCAP diff documents can be delivered to clients using a number of means, including a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package.</t></abstract>
