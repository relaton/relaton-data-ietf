<abstract><t>Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms of processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity.  Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices.  Due to the limitations of the constrained nodes it is especially important to develop a light-weight security solution which is adjusted to the relevant security objectives of each participating party in this environment.  Necessary security measures must be identified and applied where needed.  In this document, the required security related tasks are identified as guidance for the development of authentication and authorization solutions for constrained environments.  Based on the tasks, an architecture is developed to represent the relationships between the logical functional entities involved.</t></abstract>
