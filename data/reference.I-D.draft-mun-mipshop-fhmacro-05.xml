<abstract><t>In Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), a mobile node (MN) moving from one MAP domain to another can experience both long handover latency and packet loss due to the distance between the two MAPs. To solve the problems, this document describes two fast handover schemes that support fast macro mobility handover. These fast handover schemes can reduce both the handover latency and the pakcet loss. The schemes described in this document adopt the fast handover of FMIPv6 protocol to the edge access routers in MAP domains. The schemes support two fast handover modes for macro mobility handover in HMIPv6.</t></abstract>
