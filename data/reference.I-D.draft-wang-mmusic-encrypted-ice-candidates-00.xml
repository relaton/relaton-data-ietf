<abstract><t>WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of creating peer-to-peer connections.  To maximize the probability of a direct peer-to-peer connection, client private IP addresses can be included in this candidate collection, but this has privacy implications.  This document describes a way to share local IP addresses with local peers without compromising client privacy. During the ICE process, local IP addresses are encrypted and authenticated using a pre-shared key and cipher suite before being put into ICE candidates as hostnames with an ".encrypted" pseudo-top- level domain.  Other peers who also have the PSK are able to decrypt these addresses and use them normally in ICE processing.</t></abstract>
