<abstract><t>This specification defines media types for representing the future price of energy in JSON.  It also defines a way for a client device, such as an electric car, to discover a web server that can provide the future pricing for local electrical energy.  This will allow the client device to make intelligent decisions about when to use energy.  This draft is a very early skeleton of a draft to start discussion around this idea.</t></abstract>
