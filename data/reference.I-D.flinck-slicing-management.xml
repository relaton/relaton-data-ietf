<abstract><t>Network Slicing is worked in multiple SDOs from different view points.  As network slicing is an end-to-end topic, this draft proposes that network slices architecture [NS-Framework] aligns with the work done in NGMN, 3GPP and ETSI with relation to management and orchestration.  The key aspect that this draft makes is the rational for role and need for Network Slice Management Function (NSMF) entity that operates above Network Virtualization Function Orchestrator and PNFs Management Functions.  NSMF needs to support different abstractions of resources and to offer access to different management entities.</t></abstract>
