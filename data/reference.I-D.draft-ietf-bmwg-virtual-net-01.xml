<abstract><t>Benchmarking Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory characterization of dedicated physical implementations of internetworking functions.  This memo investigates additional considerations when network functions are virtualized and performed in commodity off-the-shelf hardware.  Version NOTES:  Addressed Ramki Krishnan's comments on section 4.5, power, see that section (7/27 message to the list).  Addressed Saurabh Chattopadhyay's 7/24 comments on VNF resources and other resource conditions and their effect on benchmarking, see section 3.4. Addressed Marius Georgescu's 7/17 comments on the list (sections 4.3 and 4.4).  AND, comments from the extended discussion during IETF-93 BMWG session:  Section 4.2: VNF footprint and auxilliary metrics (Maryam Tahhan), Section 4.3: Verification affect metrics (Ramki Krishnan); Section 4.4: Auxilliary metrics in the Matrix (Maryam Tahhan, Scott Bradner, others)</t></abstract>
