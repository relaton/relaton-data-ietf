<abstract><t>This document provides a new mechanism for caching DNS resolvers. When all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, the caching DNS resolvers extend the lifetime of resource records in the zone in the cache to provide resolution service as far as possible.  And when the request can't be found in the cache, during a period of time the caching DNS resolvers don't query the authoritative name servers, but directly return a NXDOMAIN to the clients to reduce the recursive name server load and the network load.</t></abstract>
