<abstract><t>In this document we provide a survey of P2P (Peer-to-Peer) systems. The survey includes a definition and a taxonomy of P2P systems.  This survey also includes a description of which types of applications can be built with P2P technologies and examples of P2P applications that are currently in use on the Internet.  Finally, we discuss architectural tradeoffs and provide guidelines for deciding whether or not a P2P architecture would be suitable to meet the requirements of a given application.</t></abstract>
