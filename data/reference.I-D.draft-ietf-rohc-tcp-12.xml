<abstract><t>This document specifies a ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profile for compression of TCP/IP packets. The profile, called ROHC-TCP, is a robust header compression scheme for TCP/IP that provides high compression efficiency combined with high robustness. ROHC-TCP also provides enhanced capabilities for compression of frequently used TCP options (such as SACK (Selective Acknowledgments) and Timestamps compared to previous TCP/IP header compression schemes. ROHC-TCP works well when used over links with significant error rates and long round-trip times. For many bandwidth-limited links where header compression is essential, such characteristics are common.</t></abstract>
