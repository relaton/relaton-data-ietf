<abstract><t>Recently some service providers try to build a converged network as a next generation network (NGN) and provide a service which guarantees a bandwidth from a local CE to a remote CE through the network. Today, customers expect triple play services through BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs. And their requirements for end-to-end QoS and session management of applications are increasing. Depending on an application, an end-to- end native RSVP path and an end-to-end MPLS TE LSP are required and they need to meet with some constraint requirements. This document describes Service Provider requirements for supporting customer RSVP and RSVP-TE over a BGP/MPLS VPN.</t></abstract>
