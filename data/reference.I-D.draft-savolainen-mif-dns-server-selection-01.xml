<abstract><t>A multi-homed host may receive DNS server configuration information from multiple physical and/or virtual network interfaces.  In split DNS scenarios not all DNS servers are able to provide the same information.  When the multi-homed host needs to utilize DNS, it has to select which of the servers to contact to.  This document describes problems of split DNS for multi-homed hosts and also a method for selecting the DNS server with help of DNS suffix information received dynamically for each network interface.  The method is useful in split DNS scenarios where private names are used and where correct DNS server selection is mandatory for successful DNS resolution.</t></abstract>
