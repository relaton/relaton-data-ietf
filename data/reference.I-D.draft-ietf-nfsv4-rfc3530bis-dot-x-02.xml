<abstract><t>The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem protocol which owes heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4 protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course, attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an Internet environment.  This document, together with RFC 3530bis replaces RFC 3530 as the definition of the NFS version 4 protocol.</t></abstract>
