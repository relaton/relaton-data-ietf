<abstract><t>Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering to deploy Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks.  As a consequence of this development, there is a need for interconnecting these local CDNs.  The necessary interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs are currently being defined in the Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNi) WG.  This document focusses on the Request Routing Interface of CDNi, and more specifically on how the solutions currently being defined in the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) WG can improve CDNi request routing.  The overall intention behind this document is to foster discussions (in the CDNi as well as in the ALTO WG) regarding a) if, b) how, and c) under what conditions ALTO can be useful to optimize CDNi request routing.  As basis for this discussion, this document provides concrete examples of how ALTO can be integrated within CDNi request routing.  The examples in this document are based on the use cases and examples currently being discussed in the CDNi WG.</t></abstract>
