<abstract><t>This document updates the registration guidance provided in Section 4.2 of RFC 5031, which allows the registration of service URNs with the 'sos' service type only for emergency services &quot;that               are offered widely and in different countries&quot;.  This document updates those instructions to allow such registrations when, at the time of registration, those services are offered in only one country.</t></abstract>
