<abstract><t>This memo is an updated version of BBN Report 5775, &quot;End-to-End    Functional Specification and describes important changes to the    functionality of the interface between a Host and the PSN, and should be    carefully reviewed by anyone involved in supporting a host on either the    ARPANET or MILNET&quot;.  The new End-to-End protocol (EE) is being developed    in order to correct a number of deficiencies in the old EE, to improve    its performance and overall throughput, and to better equip the Packet    Switch Node (PSN, also known as the IMP) to support its current and    anticipated host population.</t></abstract>
