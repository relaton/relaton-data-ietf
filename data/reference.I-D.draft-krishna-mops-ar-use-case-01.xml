<abstract><t>A use case describing transmission of an application on the Internet that has several unique characteristics of Augmented Reality (AR) applications is presented for the consideration of the Media Operations (MOPS) Working Group.  One key requirement identified is that the Adaptive-Bit-Rate (ABR) algorithms' current usage of policies based on heuristics and models is inadequate for AR applications running on the Edge Computing infrastructure.</t></abstract>
