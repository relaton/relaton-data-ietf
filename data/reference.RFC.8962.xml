<abstract><t>One mantra of the IETF is, &quot;We are not the Protocol Police.&quot; However, to ensure that protocols are implemented and deployed in full compliance with the IETF's standards, it is important to set up a body that is responsible for assessing and enforcing correct protocol behavior.</t><t>This document formally establishes the Protocol Police.  It defines the body and sets out what aspects of IETF protocols they will police.  This document acts as a point of reference for networking engineers, law enforcement officials, government representatives, and others.  It also provides advice on how to report issues to the Protocol Police.</t></abstract>
