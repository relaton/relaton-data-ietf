<abstract><t>A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to support their operations.  Many applications use the DNS to locate services for a domain, for example; more recently, some applications have begun transforming identifiers other than domain names into formats that the DNS can process.  Proposals to incorporate more sophisticated application behavior into the DNS, however, have raised questions about the applicability and extensibility of the DNS.  This document explores the architectural consequences of installing certain application features in the DNS, and provides guidance to future application designers as to the sorts of ways that application can make use of the DNS.</t></abstract>
