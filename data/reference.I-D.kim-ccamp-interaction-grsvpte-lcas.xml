<abstract><t>This document describes interaction aspects between a signaling protocol and the LCAS. The signaling protocol handled by IETF could be GMPLS RSVP-TE. GMPLS CR-LDP requires further study for this draft. The LCAS protocol handled by ITU-T is a protocol that is used to change the bandwidth capacity of a virtual concatenated signal used by transport networks (i.e. SDH and OTN), which should be initiated only in a unidirection by EMS or NMS systems. However, the GMPLS signaling protocol have a feature of being capable of controlling bi- directional connections on a LSP. In current, there is no interaction between the signaling protocol and the LCAS. In this document, when a signaling protocol such as the GMPLS RSVP-TE and the LCAS are used together within a single node and a bi-directional connection is required on the same route, relevant requirements and encoding methods are identified.</t></abstract>
