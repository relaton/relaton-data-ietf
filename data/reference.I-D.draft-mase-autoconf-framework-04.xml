<abstract><t>We consider the unique address/prefix autoconfiguration problem for MANETs.  Specifically, we consider two cases.  First, a node without a pre-assigned and valid local address/prefix acquires a new local address/prefix and becomes a member of a new or existing MANET. Second, two or more MANETs merge.  In the first case, a mechanism of IP address/prefix generation is needed.  We may have MANET-wide duplicate address/prefix detection (DAD) on newly generated address/ prefix (tentative address/prefix) for suppressing occurrence of address/prefix conflict with existing address/prefixes (pre-service DAD).  In the second case, duplicate address/prefix may occur as the result of a merger of two formerly independent networks.  We may have DAD on addresses/prefixes in use for detecting and resolving duplicate addresses/prefixes and suppressing routing information contamination due to existence of duplicate addresses/prefixes (in- service DAD).  To define pre-service DAD and in-service DAD, we use autoconfiguration phases that are common for both proactive and reactive routing protocol.  Each node exists in one of the autoconfiguration phases at any time.  A node, that detects duplicate address/prefix between other nodes, may advertise the detected duplicate address/prefix to all other nodes in the MANET.  This is termed "Duplicate address/prefix advertisement" (DAA).  The specific DAD and DAA algorithm is beyond the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
