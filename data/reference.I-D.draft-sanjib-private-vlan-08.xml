<abstract><t>A VLAN is a broadcast domain. Within such domain, devices can establish direct communication with one another at Layer 2. If untrusted devices are introduced into a VLAN, security issues may arise because trusted and untrusted devices end up sharing the same broadcast domain. The traditional solution to this kind of problem is to assign a separate VLAN to each user concerned about Layer 2 security issues. That however is not always a scalable solution.  This document describes a mechanism to achieve device isolation through the application of special Layer 2 forwarding constraints. Such mechanism allows end devices to share the same IP subnet while being Layer 2 isolated, which in turn allows network designers to employ larger subnets and so reduce the address management overhead.</t></abstract>
