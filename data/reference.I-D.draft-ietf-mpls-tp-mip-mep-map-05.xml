<abstract><t>The Framework for Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) within the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes how Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs) may be situated within network nodes at the incoming and outgoing interfaces.  This document elaborates on important considerations for internal MIP addressing.  More precisely it describes important restrictions for any mechanism that specifies a way of forming OAM messages so that they can be targeted at MIPs on incoming or MIPs on outgoing interfaces and forwarded correctly through the forwarding engine. Furthermore, the document includes considerations for node implementations where there is no distinction between the incoming and outgoing MIP.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</t></abstract>
