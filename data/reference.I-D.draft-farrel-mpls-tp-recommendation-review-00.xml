<abstract><t>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) in cooperation between the IETF and the ITU-T is documented in RFC 5317 as the report of the Joint Working Team on MPLS-TP. As part of this development process, the International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications Standardisation Sector (ITU-T) will develop a number of Recommendations that document the integration of MPLS-TP into the transport network. Those Recomendations will not define any aspects of MPLS-TP protocols or procedure because that work is reserved for the IETF as the design authority for MPLS-TP.  This document sets out the IETF's expectations of how the IETF, through individual participation and through consensus decisions, will contribute to in the development, review, and approval of those Recommendations.  This document does not modify any existing ITU-T or IETF procedures, but shows how those procedures can be used to facilitate cooperation for the MPLS-TP project.</t></abstract>
