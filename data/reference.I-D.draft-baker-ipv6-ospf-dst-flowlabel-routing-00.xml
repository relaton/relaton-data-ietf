<abstract><t>This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route classes of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 Flow Label and a destination prefix.  This implies not routing "to a destination", but "traffic matching a classification tuple".  The obvious application is data center inter-tenant routing using a form of role-based access control.  If the sender doesn't know the value to insert in the flow label (the receiver's tenant ID), he in effect has no route to that destination.</t></abstract>
