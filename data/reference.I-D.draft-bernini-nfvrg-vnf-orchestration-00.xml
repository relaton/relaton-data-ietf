<abstract><t>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) aims at evolving the way network operators design, deploy and provision their networks by leveraging standard IT virtualization technologies to move and consolidate a wide range of network functions and services onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage.  Primary area of impact for operators is the network edge, being stimulated by the recent updates on NFV and SDN.  In fact, operators are looking at their future datacenters and Points of Presence (PoPs) as increasingly dynamic infrastructures to deploy Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) and on-demand chained services with high elasticity.  This document presents an orchestration framework for automated deployment of highly available VNF chains.  Resiliency of VNFs and chained services is a key requirement for operators to improve, ease, automate and speed up services lifecycle management.  The proposed VNFs orchestration framework is also positioned with respect to current NFV and Service Function Chaining (SFC) architectures and solutions.</t></abstract>
