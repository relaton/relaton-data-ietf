<abstract><t>This document presents a taxonomy of "Alternative Network Deployments", and a set of definitions and shared properties.  It also surveys the technologies employed in these networks, and their differing architectural characteristics.  The term "Alternative Network Deployments" includes a set of network access models that have emerged in the last decade.  These networks aim to bring Internet connectivity to people, using topological, architectural and business models different from the so-called "traditional" ones, where a company deploys or leases the network infrastructure for connecting the users, who pay a subscription fee to be connected and make use of it.  Several initiatives throughout the world have built large scale Alternative Networks, using predominantly wireless technologies (including long distance) due to the reduced cost of using unlicensed spectrum.  Wired technologies such as fiber are also used in some of these alternate networks.  The emergence of these networks has been motivated by a variety of factors such as the reluctance of network operators to provide wired and cellular infrastructures to rural/remote areas.  In these cases, the networks have self-sustaining business models that provide more localized communication services as well as Internet backhaul support through peering agreements with traditional network operators.  In other cases, networks are built as a complement to commercial Internet access provided by "traditional" network operators.  The present classification considers extant network models such as Community Networks, which are self-organized and decentralized networks wholly owned by the community; networks owned by individuals who act as Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs); networks owned by individuals but leased out to network operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, and finally there are networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users.  Different criteria are used in order to build a classification e.g., the ownership of the equipment, the way the network is organized, the participatory model, the extensibility, if they are driven by a community, a company or a local stakeholder (public or private), etc.  According to the developed taxonomy, a characterization of each kind of network is presented in terms of specific network characteristics related to architecture, organization, etc.</t></abstract>
