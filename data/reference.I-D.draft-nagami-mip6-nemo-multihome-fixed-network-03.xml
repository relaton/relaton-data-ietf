<abstract><t>Multi-homing technology improves the availability of host and network connectivity. Since the node and network behavior of mobile networking and fixed networking are different, the different architecture has been discussed and proposed. This document proposes the common architecture both for mobile and fixed networking environment, using the mobile IP and NEMO. The proposed architecture only requires a modification of the mobile IP and NEMO so that multiple-CoA can be used. In addition, multiple HAs which are located in different place, are required for redundancy.</t></abstract>
