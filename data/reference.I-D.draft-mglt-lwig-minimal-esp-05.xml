<abstract><t>This document describes a minimal implementation of the IP Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) described in RFC 4303.  Its purpose is to enable implementation of ESP with a minimal set of options that makes the minimal implementation compatible with ESP as described in RFC 4303.  A minimal version of ESP is not intended to become a replacement of the RFC 4303 ESP, but instead to enable a limited implementation to interoperate with implementations of RFC 4303 ESP.  This document describes what is required from RFC 4303 ESP as well as various ways to optimize compliance with RFC 4303 ESP.  This document does not update or modify RFC 4303, but provides a compact description of how to implement the minimal version of the protocol.  If this document and RFC 4303 conflicts then RFC 4303 is the authoritative description.</t></abstract>
