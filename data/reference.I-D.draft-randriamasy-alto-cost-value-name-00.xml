<abstract><t>The IETF ALTO protocol provides guidance to content delivery applications such as P2P or Content Delivery Networks (CDN), which have to select one or several hosts or endpoints from a set of candidates that are able to provide a desired data resource.  This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, for instance the topological distance or the routing cost between them.  To this end, ALTO Servers deployed by Network Operators (NO), provide requesting ALTO Clients with information, currently such as the NO- centric view on the network topology, the candidate application endpoints with attributes such as their connectivity type.  The present draft proposes to extend the cost information provided by the ALTO protocol by providing, for a same cost metric, several possible cost values.  Which value to provide depends on qualitative criteria as opposed to quantitative criteria such as time.  The purpose is to allow a finer grained decision on which application endpoint or sub network to access given that their routing cost values may depend on criteria suh as the access technology of the end system consuming the resources or the policy applied for the client requesting ALTO information.</t></abstract>
