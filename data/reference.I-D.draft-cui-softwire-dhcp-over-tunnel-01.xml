<abstract><t>This document analyzes the scenario in which DHCPv4 interaction is performed over IP-IP tunnel, and proposes methods to keep DHCP working under such situation.  The main issue is encapsulation of DHCP packets on server side, and there are both in-protocol and out- of-protocol solutions for this issue.  The in-protocol solution is to have DHCP carrying the encapsulation address information, and the out-of-protocol solution is to have the DHCP server keeping track of the address mapping by inspecting DHCP packets.</t></abstract>
