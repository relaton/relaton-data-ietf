<abstract><t>This document provides a framework for the development of IP fast- reroute mechanisms which provide protection against link or router failure by invoking locally determined repair paths.  Unlike MPLS Fast-reroute, the mechanisms are applicable to a network employing conventional IP routing and forwarding.  An essential part of such mechanisms is the prevention of packet loss caused by the loops which normally occur during the re-convergence of the network following a failure.</t></abstract>
