<abstract><t>This document provides a mechanism by which web servers can provide metadata of a web resource which is indicated by a URL.  The web client like web browser can use this metadata to filter out unwanted web resource or link to itself.  In addition, the web client can take advantage of such metadata to provide high-level services like displaying additional information about the web resource without downloading it.  We expect this mechanism to enable quick access to metadata of any web resource from any web client reduces overall web traffic remarkably.</t></abstract>
