<abstract><t>This document standardises the two marking behaviours of PCN-nodes: threshold marking and excess traffic marking.  Threshold marking marks all PCN-packets if the PCN traffic rate is greater than a first configured rate.  Excess traffic marking marks a proportion of PCN- packets, such that the amount marked equals the traffic rate in excess of a second configured rate.</t></abstract>
