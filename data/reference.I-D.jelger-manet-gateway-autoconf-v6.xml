<abstract><t>Adhoc networks are formed by the spontaneous collaboration of wireless nodes when no networking infrastructure is available. When communication to the Internet is desired, one or more nodes must act as gateways for the adhoc network. In this case, global addressing of adhoc nodes is required. This document specifies a protocol (node behaviour, information propagation, message format) which allows nodes in an adhoc network to discover a gateway/prefix pair which is used in order to build an IPv6 global address and, when necessary, to maintain a default route towards the Internet.</t></abstract>
