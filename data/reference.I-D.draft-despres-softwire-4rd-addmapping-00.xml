<abstract><t>This document specifies an address mapping mechanism, 4rd, for service providers to offer residual deployment of the IPv4 service across IPv6-only domains.  Ease of operation and scalability are due to address mapping being done stateless (no per customer states). Features include support of shared IPv4 addresses, same routes for IPv4 as for IPv6, and compatibility with both provider aggregatable and provider-independent IPv4 prefixes.  IPv4 address sharing is based on exclusive port sets that are algorithmically derived of IPv4 prefixes longer than 32 bits.  The 4rd address mapping can be used combined with various tunneling or translation mechanisms.  It can also can be used either alone or in parallel with stateful mechanisms used for their flexibility.</t></abstract>
