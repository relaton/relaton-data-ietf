<abstract><t>This document suggests the GR enhancement for BSR, BIDIR and PIM-SM.  -This draft suggests a mechanism to refresh  E-BSR state and to learn RP-Set on Rebooted E-BSR Router quickly.  -This draft suggests a mechanism for PIM-BIDIR Downstream Routers to  refresh the (*, G) state only after 'Rebooted Upstream Router has  learnt the RP Information and DF election is complete'.  -This draft suggests a mechanism for PIM-SM Downstream Router to  delay the (*, G) joins to allow RP Information to be learnt on  Rebooted Upstream Router. It also suggests the mechanism to refresh  the Assert-Winner or Assert-Loser state on Rebooting Router.</t></abstract>
