<abstract><t>This document updates RFC 4785 and RFC 4279 and specifies a set of ciphersuites that use an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated with a pre-shared key. These ciphersuites provides Perfect Forward Secrecy. It specifies as well one authentication- only ciphersuites (with no encryption). This ciphersuite is useful when authentication and integrity protection is desired, but confidentiality is not needed or not permitted. The reader is expected to become familiar with RFC 4785 and RFC 4279 prior to studying this document.</t></abstract>
