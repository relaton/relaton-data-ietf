<abstract><t>HTTP Cookies, as originally defined by Netscape in [NETSC] and as later updated by [RFC2109] and [RFC2965] did not address the issue of how to restrict which domains a server is allowed to set a cookie for: This is particularly a problem for servers hosted in top level domains having subdomains that are controlled by registries and not by domain owners, e.g. co.uk and city.state.us domains.  In such situations, unless the client uses some kind of domain black-list, it is possible for a malicious server to set cookies so they are sent to all servers in a domain the attacker does not control.  These cookies may adversly affect the function of servers receiving them.  The primary reason this is a problem is that the server receiving the cookie has no way of telling which server originally set it, and is therefore not able to reliably distinguish an invalid cookie from a valid cookie.  This document proposes a new attribute, "$Origin", that is associated with each cookie and sent in all client cookie headers in the requests sent to the server.  Servers recognizing the attribute may then check to see if the cookie was set by a server which is allowed to set cookies for the server, and if necessary ignore the cookie.</t></abstract>
