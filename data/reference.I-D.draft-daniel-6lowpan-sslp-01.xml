<abstract><t>The Simple Service Location Protocol (SSLP) provides a framework for the discovery and selection of the services working on 6LoWPAN. The protocol has a simple structure that is easy to be implemented on 6LoWPAN devices that are characterized by short range, low bit rate and low power. The protocol also offers a mechanism for interoperability with the IP networks under SLP. It enables communication between 6LoWPAN and other IP networks.</t></abstract>
