<abstract><t>The US National Institute of Standards and Technology has chosen a new Advanced Encryption Standard, which is significantly faster and (it is believed) more secure than the old DES algorithm. This document is a specification for the addition of this algorithm to the Kerberos cryptosystem suite. Comments should be sent to the author, or to the IETF Kerberos working group (ietf-krb-wg@anl.gov).</t></abstract>
