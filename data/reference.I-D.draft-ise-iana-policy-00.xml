<abstract><t>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries to track codepoints used by protocols defined by the IETF and documented in RFCs developed on the IETF Stream.  The Independent Submissions Stream is another source of documents that can be published as RFCs.  This stream is under the care of the Independent Submissions Editor (ISE).  This document updates RFC 4846 by describing how the current ISE will handle documents in the Independent Submissions Stream that request actions from the IANA.  Nothing in this document changes existing IANA registries and their allocation policies.</t></abstract>
