<abstract><t>It is evident that to ensure seamless and robust user experience across all type of access networks multimedia communication suits should adapt to the changing network conditions.  There is an ongoing effort in IETF RMCAT working group to standardize rate adaptive algorithm(s) to be used in the real-time interactive communication. In this document test cases are described to evaluate the performances of the proposed endpoint adaptation solutions in LTE networks and Wi-Fi networks.  It is aimed that the proposed solutions should be evaluated using the test cases defined in this document to select most optimal solutions.</t></abstract>
