<abstract><t>New hash algorithms are being developed and these algorithms may include parameters.  CMS has not currently defined any hash algorithms with parameters, but anecdotal evidence suggests that defining one could cause major problems.  In this document we define just such an algorithm and describe how to use it so that we can run experiments to find out how bad including hash parameters will be.</t></abstract>
