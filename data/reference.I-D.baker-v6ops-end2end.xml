<abstract><t>This note is intended to describe the end to end problem as it applies to a network of networks, wherein some component networks independently run only IPv4 with or without a transition mechanism, some run only IPv6 with or without a transition mechanism and without coordination of transition mechanisms, and some run IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel supporting native routing.</t></abstract>
