<abstract><t>CoRE defines a mechanism for resource discovery based on Web linking with discovery, registration,modification, and other procedures. But energy efficiency is very important for resource constrained devices. This specification shows an efficient method for CoAP proxy finding the resource from end-points by reducing multicast messages.  The current version -01 of this document is just an initial draft that is modified according to related comments.</t></abstract>
