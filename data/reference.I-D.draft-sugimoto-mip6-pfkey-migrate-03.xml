<abstract><t>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and show how the two protocols can interwork. We propose a set of extensions to the PF_KEY framework which allows smooth and solid operation of IKE in a Mobile IPv6 environment. The first extension is called PF_KEY MIGRATE and is for migrating the endpoint addresses of a IPsec Security Association pair in tunnel mode. The second extension is named SADB_X_EXT_PACKET and allows IKE to make the right choice for address selection in bootstrapping process. Both extensions are helpful for assuring smooth interworking between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and achieving performance optimization.</t></abstract>
