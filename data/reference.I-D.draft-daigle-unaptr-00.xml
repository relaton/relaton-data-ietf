<abstract><t>The purpose of this memo is to provide a small extension to the "Straightforward NAPTR" (S-NAPTR) Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application so that URIs can be offered as the target of the DDDS resolution. It is not yet clear (in this -00 draft) whether that is best achievedby extending the S-NAPTR specification, or by providing a new DDDS Application. This version of the draft focuses on describing the extension and pros/cons of either approach.</t></abstract>
