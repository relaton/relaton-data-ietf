<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) allows Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to request path computations from Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and lets the PCEs return responses. When computing or re-optimizing the routes of a set of TE LSPs through a network it may be advantageous to perform bulk path computations in order to avoid blocking problems and to achieve more optimal network-wide solutions.  Such bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO).  A GCO is able to simultaneously consider the entire topology of the network and the complete set of existing TE LSPs, and their respective constraints, and look to optimize or re-optimize the entire network to satisfy all constraints for all TE LSPs.  A GCO may also be applied to some subset of the TE LSPs in a network.  The GCO application is primarily a Network Management System (NMS) solution.  This document provides application-specific requirements and the PCEP extensions in support of GCO applications.</t></abstract>
