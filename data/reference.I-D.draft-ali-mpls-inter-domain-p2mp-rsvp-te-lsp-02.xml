<abstract><t>Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may be established using signaling techniques described in [RFC4875].  However, [RFC4875] does not address issues that arise when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in multi-domain networks. Specifically, it does not provide a mechanism to avoid re-merges in inter-domain P2MP TE LSPs.  This document provides a framework and protocol extensions for establishing and controlling P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in multi-domain networks. This document borrows inter-domain TE terminology from [RFC4726], e.g., for the purposes of this document, a domain is considered to be any collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility.  Examples of such domains include Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASes).</t></abstract>
