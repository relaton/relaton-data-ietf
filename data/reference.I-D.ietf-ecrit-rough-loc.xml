<abstract><t>Emergency calling works best when precise location is available for emergency call routing.  However, there are situations in which a location provider is unable or unwilling to provide precise location, yet still wishes to enable subscribers to make emergency calls.  This document describes the level of location accuracy that providers must provide to enable emergency call routing.  In addition, we describe additional rules for networks and endpoints to enable emergency calling by endpoints that do not have access to precise location.</t></abstract>
