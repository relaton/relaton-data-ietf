<abstract><t>DHCPv6 defined in [RFC3315] does not offer server redundancy.  This document defines a design for DHCPv6 failover, a mechanism for running two servers on the same network with capability for either server to take over clients' leases in case of server failure or network partition.  This is a DHCPv6 Failover design document, it is not a protocol specification document.  It is a second document in a planned series of three documents.  DHCPv6 failover requirements are specified in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-requirements].  A protocol specification document is planned to follow this document.</t></abstract>
