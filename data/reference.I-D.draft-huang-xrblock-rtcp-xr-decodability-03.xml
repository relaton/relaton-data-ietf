<abstract><t>Transport Stream is a standard container format used in the transmission and storage of multimedia data.  This document defines an RTCP XR Report Block that allows the reporting of decodability statistics metrics related to transmissions in Transport Stream format.  This XR Report Block includes 8 metrics from ETSI TR 101 290, which are most important and most universal metrics from priorities 1 and 2.  The metrics from priority 3 are defined as application dependent monitoring, and the unadopted metrics are never or seldom happending during the content transmission.  So this kind of metrics are omitted by this draft.</t></abstract>
