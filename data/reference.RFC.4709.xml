<title>Mounting Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Servers</title>

<abstract><t>In current Web browsers, there is no uniform way to specify that a user clicking on a link will be presented with an editable view of a Web Distinguished Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) server.  For example, it is frequently desirable to be able to click on a link and have this link open a window that can handle drag-and-drop interaction with the resources of a WebDAV server.</t><t>This document specifies a mechanism and a document format that enables WebDAV servers to send &quot;mounting&quot; information to a WebDAV client.  The mechanism is designed to work on any platform and with any combination of browser and WebDAV client, relying solely on the well-understood dispatch of documents through their MIME type.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
