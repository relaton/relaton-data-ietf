<abstract><t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), defined in RFC 3748, facilitates multiple authentication methods that are widely deployed today.  As tunnel mechanisms become more prevalent, there has been interest in carrying other types of data between the EAP Peer and the EAP server.  Existing tunnel EAP methods have already defined generic data structures to carry such information.  This document defines a generic TLV "container" that can be used within an EAP method.</t></abstract>
