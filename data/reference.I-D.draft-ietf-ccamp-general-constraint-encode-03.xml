<abstract><t>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching can be used to control a wide variety of technologies. In some of these technologies network elements and links may impose additional routing constraints such as asymmetric switch connectivity, non-local label assignment, and label range limitations on links.  This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for general information elements representing connectivity and label constraints as well as label availability. It is intended that protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how information is carried for specific uses.</t></abstract>
