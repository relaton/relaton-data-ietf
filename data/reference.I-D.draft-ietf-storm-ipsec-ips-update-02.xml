<abstract><t>RFC 3723 specifies IPsec requirements for block storage protocols over IP (e.g., iSCSI) based on IPsec v2 (RFC 2401 and related RFCs); those requirements have subsequently been applied to remote direct data placement protocols, e.g., RDMAP.  This document updates RFC 3723's IPsec requirements to IPsec v3 (RFC 4301 and related RFCs) and makes some changes to required algorithms based on developments in cryptography since RFC 3723 was published.  [RFC Editor: The "Updates:" list above has been truncated by xml2rfc. The complete list is - Updates: 3720, 3723, 3821, 3822, 4018, 4172, 4173, 4174, 5040, 5041, 5042, 5043, 5044, 5045, 5046, 5047, 5048 (if approved) ]</t></abstract>
