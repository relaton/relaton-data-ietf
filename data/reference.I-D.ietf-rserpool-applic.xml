<abstract><t>This document describes the applicability of the reliable server pool architecture and protocols to applications which want to have High avialebility services. This is accomplished by using redundant servers and failover between servers of the same pool in case of server failure. Processing load in a pool may de distributed/shared between the members of the pool according to a certain policy. Also some guidance is given on the choice of underlying transport protocol (and corresponding transport protocol mapping) for transporting application data and Rserpool specific control data.</t></abstract>
