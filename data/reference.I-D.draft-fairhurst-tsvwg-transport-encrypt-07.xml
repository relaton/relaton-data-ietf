<abstract><t>This document describes implications of applying end-to-end encryption at the transport layer.  It identifies in-network uses of transport layer header information.  It then reviews the implications of developing end-to-end transport protocols that use encryption to provide confidentiality of the transport protocol header and expected implications of transport protocol design and network operation. Since transport measurement and analysis of the impact of network characteristics have been important to the design of current transport protocols, it also considers the impact on transport and application evolution.</t></abstract>
