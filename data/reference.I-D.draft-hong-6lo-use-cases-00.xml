<abstract><t>This document describes the characteristics of link layer technologies that are used at constrained node networks and typical use cases of IPv6 over networks of resource-constrained nodes.  In addition to IEEE 802.15.4, various link layer technologies such as BLE, Z-wave, DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC, and IEEE 802.15.4e are widely used at constrained node networks for typical services.  Based on these link layer technologies, IPv6 over networks of resource-constrained nodes has various and practical use cases.  To efficiently implement typical services, the applicability and consideration of several design spaces are described.</t></abstract>
