<title>Gratuitous Neighbor Discovery: Creating Neighbor Cache Entries on First-Hop Routers</title>
<author initials='J.' surname='Linkova' fullname='J. Linkova'><organization /></author>
<date year='2021' month='October' />
<abstract><t>Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain reachability information. This document updates RFC 4861 to allow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned to a node. It also updates RFC 4861 and recommends that nodes send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6 address. These changes will minimize the delay and packet loss when a node initiates connections to an off-link destination from a new IPv6 address.</t></abstract>
