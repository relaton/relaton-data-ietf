<abstract><t>CoAP is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks.  It is anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building automation scenario all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off as a group).  This document provides guidance for how the CoAP protocol should be used in a group communication context. An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed.  Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate important concepts.  Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in various network topologies.</t></abstract>
