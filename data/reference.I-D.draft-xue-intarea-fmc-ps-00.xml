<abstract><t>The purpose of this document is to analyze the issues that have arisen so far and then to propose a set of requirements for the Fixed Mobile Convergence.  The term Fixed Mobile Convergence spans several scenarios from true integration of fixed and mobile terminals, services, and network infrastructure on both technical and management level down to pure interworking between fixed and mobile networks in serving access for multi-interface terminals like todays' smartphones.  In the interworking scenario, the mobile network passes on the mobile subscribers policies to the fixed broadband network in order to maintain the end-to-end service level agreement and to support remote terminal and access network management.  Explicitly, the fixed broadband network must have partnership with the mobile network in Fixed Mobile Convergence interworking scenario.  This document gives a brief overview of the assumed Fixed Mobile Convergence architecture and related works and then introduces several requirements based on the partnership in Fixed Mobile Convergence architecture, such as User Equipment identification and authentication, Femto Access Point management, device type identification and mobility considerations.</t></abstract>
