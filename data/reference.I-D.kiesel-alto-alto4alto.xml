<abstract><t>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates that are able to provide a desired resource.  Entities seeking guidance need to discover and possibly select an ALTO server to ask.  This document proposes an ALTO-based scheme to select an ALTO server that can give guidance to a given ALTO client.  Unlike some other proposed ALTO discovery mechanisms, this solution works well if the client seeks guidance from a set of ALTO servers that are operated by an entity which is not the operator of the access network.</t></abstract>
