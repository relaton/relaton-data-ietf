<title>Clarifications to BGP Origin Validation Based on Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</title>
<author initials='R.' surname='Bush' fullname='R. Bush'><organization /></author>

<abstract><t>Deployment of BGP origin validation based on Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is hampered by, among other things, vendor misimplementations in two critical areas: which routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified by configuration. This document is meant to clarify possible misunderstandings causing those misimplementations; it thus updates RFC 6811 by clarifying that all prefixes should have their validation state set and that policy must not be applied without operator configuration.</t></abstract>
