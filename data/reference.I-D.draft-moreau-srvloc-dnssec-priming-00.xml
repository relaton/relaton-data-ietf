<abstract><t>By assigning the SLP (Service Location Protocol, [RFC2608]) UA (User Agent) role to a DNS resolver, the present document opens the door to selective deployment of DNS root nameservice substitution within an administrative domain. This SLP scheme directly addresses the DNS resolver configuration scaling issue. It is envisioned that various DNS root nameservice substitution undertakings target their respective user base, and no single one will be exposed alone to the global scaling problem. Usage is limited to DNSSEC-enabled root nameservice. Moreover, from the SLP security features, the proposed scheme expands the set of DNS root trust anchor key rollover options.</t></abstract>
