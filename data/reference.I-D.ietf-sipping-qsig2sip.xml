<abstract><t>This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks (also known as enterprise networks). SIP is an Internet application- layer control (signalling) protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants. These sessions include, in particular, telephone calls. QSIG is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating circuit-switched calls, in particular telephone calls, within Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). QSIG is specified in a number of ECMA Standards and published also as ISO/IEC standards.</t></abstract>
