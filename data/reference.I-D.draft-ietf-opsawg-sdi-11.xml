<abstract><t>Deploying a new network device in a location where the operator has no staff of its own often requires that an employee physically travel to the location to perform the initial install and configuration, even in shared facilities with "remote-hands" type support.  In many cases, this could be avoided if there were a secure way to initially provision the device.  This document extends existing vendor proprietary auto-install to make the process more secure.
