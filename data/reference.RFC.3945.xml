<abstract><t>Future data and transmission networks will consist of elements such as routers, switches, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems, Add-Drop Multiplexors (ADMs), photonic cross-connects (PXCs), optical cross-connects (OXCs), etc. that will use Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) to dynamically provision resources and to provide network survivability using protection and restoration techniques. </t><t> This document describes the architecture of GMPLS.  GMPLS extends MPLS to encompass time-division (e.g., SONET/SDH, PDH, G.709), wavelength (lambdas), and spatial switching (e.g., incoming port or fiber to outgoing port or fiber).  The focus of GMPLS is on the control plane of these various layers since each of them can use physically diverse data or forwarding planes.  The intention is to cover both the signaling and the routing part of that control plane.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
