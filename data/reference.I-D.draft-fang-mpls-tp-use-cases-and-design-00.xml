<abstract><t>This document provides use case studies and network design considerations for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  In the recent years, MPLS-TP has emerged as the technology of choice to meet the needs of transport evolution. Many service providers (SPs) intend to replace SONET/SDH, TDM, ATM traditional transport technologies with MPLS-TP, to achieve higher efficiency, low operational cost, while maintaining transport characteristics. The use cases for MPLS-TP include Mobile backhaul, Metro Ethernet access and aggregation, packet optical transport. The design considerations include operational experience, standards compliance, technology maturity, end-to-end design and OAM consistency, compatibility with IP/MPLS networks, and multi-vendor interoperability. The goal is to provide reliable, manageable, and scalable transport solutions.  The unified MPLS strategy - using MPLS from core to aggregation and access (e.g. IP/MPLS in the core, IP/MPLS or MPLS-TP in aggregation and access) appear to be very attractive for many SPs. It streamlines the operation, reduce the overall complexity and convergence issues, leveraging MPLS experience, and improve the ability to support revenue generating services.</t></abstract>
