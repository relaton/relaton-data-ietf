<abstract><t>This document extends the pNFS protocol to communicate the results of permission checks for access to the data servers referenced by layouts, including checks performed by both clients and the MDS. The extension provides means for clients to communicate client-detected access denial errors to the MDS, including the case in which a client requests direct NFS access via the MDS that the MDS cannot perform.</t></abstract>
