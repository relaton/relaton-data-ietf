<abstract><t>For when we can't meet in person, when there's interim work to be done, or just because the task calls for it, an asynchronous text- based meeting can sometimes be perfectly productive and useful. Given how much the IETF uses email already [RFC3934] this document aims to create additional guidance for co-chairs and meeting facilitators who might want to host a meeting asynchronously with mailing lists.  Drawing from decades of facilitation experience in global networks, the document also treats unique considerations for facilitators that are introduced by this meeting methodology.</t></abstract>
