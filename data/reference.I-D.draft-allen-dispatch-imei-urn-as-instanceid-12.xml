<abstract><t>This specification specifies how the Uniform Resource Name (URN) reserved for the GSMA (GSM Association) identities and its sub- namespace for the IMEI (International Mobile station Equipment Identity) can be used as an instance-id.  Its purpose is to fulfil the requirements in RFC 5626 [1] that state "If a URN scheme other than UUID (Universally unique identifier) is used, the UA (User Agent) MUST only use URNs for which an RFC (from the IETF stream) defines how the specific URN needs to be constructed and used in the "+sip.instance" Contact header field parameter for outbound behavior."</t></abstract>
