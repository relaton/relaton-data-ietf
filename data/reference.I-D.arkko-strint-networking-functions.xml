<abstract><t>This paper discusses the inherent tussle between network functions and some aspects of privacy.  There is clearly room for a much improved privacy in Internet communications, but there are also interesting interactions with network functions, e.g., what information networks need to provide a service.  Exploring these limits is useful to better understand potential improvements.</t></abstract>
