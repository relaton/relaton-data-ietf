<abstract><t>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication.  The security needs are well-recognized and and many standardization steps for providing security have been taken, for example, the specification of Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  However, the design space of IoT applications and systems is complex and exposed to multiple types of threats.  In particular, threats keep evolving at a fast pace while many IoT systems are rarely updated and still remain operational for decades.  This document has three main parts: First, it summarizes exemplary security threats and suitable mitigation strategies to protect against multiple types of threats.  Second, it describes a comprehensive agile security framework to integrate existing security processes such as risk asssement or vulnerability assessment in the lifecycle of a smart object in an IoT application.  Thus, instead of having a security configuration that is fixed at manufacturing time, our approach allows us to apply a - security profile - on the device tailored for a specific environment at any point of time.  Third, we discuss the concept of security profiles and give examples of them.  The core of our agile security approach relies on two protocols: the Protocol for Automatic Security Configuration (PASC) and the Protocol for Automatic Vulnerability Assessment (PAVA).  PACS is executed during the onboarding phase of a smart object in an IoT system and is in charge of automatically performing a risk assessment and assigning a security profile to defeat the identified risks.  The assigned security profile fits the specific environment and threat model of the application in which the device has been deployed.  PAVA is executed during the operation of the IoT object and ensures that vulnerabilities in the smart object and IoT system are discovered in a proactive way.  These two protocols can benefit users, manufactures and operators by automating IoT security.  We describe a few examplary security profiles that could be applicable in different application areas and automatically configured by means of PASC and PAVA.</t></abstract>
