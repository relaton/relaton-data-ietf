<abstract><t>The Email Address Internationalization (EAI) is implemented by allowing UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail headers. To deliver email which uses UTF-8 on email headers through EAI incompliant environment converting (i.e downgrading) or encapsulation mechanism is required. Some of UTF-8 email may sign email headers or email header fields. This document describes mechanism for encapsulation when converting can not be used because of signed email headers. Encapsulation may also used to forward EAI email through EAI incompliant environment that way that original EAI email can be recovered.</t></abstract>
