<abstract><t>   This document presents an alternative addressing architecture for
IPv6 which controls global routing growth with very aggressive
topological aggregation. It also includes support for scalable
multihoming as a distinguished service while freeing sites and
service resellers from the tyranny of CIDR-based aggregation by
providing transparent rehoming of both.</t></abstract>
