<abstract><t>This specification describes identifier-locator addressing (ILA) in IPv6 for network virtualization. Identifier-locator addressing differentiates between location and identity of a network node. Part of an address expresses the immutable identity of the node, and another part indicates the location of the node which can be dynamic. In the context of virtualization, a virtual address serves as an identifier and the address of the host where the associated tenant system currently resides is a locator.</t></abstract>
