<abstract><t>We describe the 'out-of-band' exchange of data in a classical enrollment protocol as a Trusted Transitive Introduction (TTI) between two end entities and an introducer, thus distinguishing introduction from enrollment. This document describes the three system entities in the trusted transitive introduction model and the data exchanges between them. Three introduction stages are defined and examined in the context of a 'TTI over HTTP' introduction.</t></abstract>
