<abstract><t>Path computation in large multi-layer and multi-region networks is complex and may require special computational components and cooperation between different network domains, whereby a failure affect to establish a path or a failure of an existing path may be corrected by a new path computation and fresh signaling.  This document specifies the crank-back routing mechanism based on re- routing in crank back Path Computation Element (PCE).  When a Path Computation Client (PCC) requests a PCE for a route, it may be useful for the PCC to specify Crank-back routing to the path computation, abstract nodes, resources, and domains that are to be explicitly excluded from the computed route.  Such mechanism is termed Crank- back routing.  The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication protocol between PCCs and PCEs.  To support this mechanism, function of PCE and procedure of PCEP signaling performance are extended.</t></abstract>
