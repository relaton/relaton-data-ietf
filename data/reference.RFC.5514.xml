<title>IPv6 over Social Networks</title>

<abstract><t>There is a lack of IPv6 utilization in early 2009; this is partly linked to the fact that the number of IPv6 nodes is rather low.  This document proposes to vastly increase the number of IPv6 hosts by transforming all Social Networking platforms into IPv6 networks. This will immediately add millions of IPv6 hosts to the existing IPv6 Internet.  This document includes sections on addressing and transport of IPv6 over a Social Network.  A working prototype has been developed.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the  Internet community.</t></abstract>
