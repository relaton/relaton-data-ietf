<abstract><t>When transmitting an IPv6 packet to a multicast group address, the destination address in the link-layer header is typically set to the corresponding mapped address of that multicast group address. However, it is not mandatory that the destination address in the link-layer header is always a mapped multicast equivalent of its IP destination address.  There are various deployment scenarios where there a need to transmit an IPv6 multicast message as an unicast message on the link-layer.  Unfortunately, the IPv6 specifications do not clearly state this.  This document explicitly clarifies this aspect and makes such packet construct and transmission legal and valid.</t></abstract>
