<abstract><t>Internet storage services have become more and more popular.  They attract a huge number of users and produce a significant share of Internet traffic.  Most existing Internet storage services make use of proprietary sync protocols with different capabilities to achieve the data sync.  However, a single Internet storage service using its proprietary sync protocols has intrinsic limitations on service usability and network performance.

It also shows a demand for designing a standard sync protocol to achieve better usability and sync performance.</t></abstract>
