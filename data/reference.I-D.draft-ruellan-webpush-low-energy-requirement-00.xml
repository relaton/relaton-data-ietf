<abstract><t>Many devices are now connected to the Internet.  Receiving instantaneous notifications from the Web is an appealing but possibly power-hungry feature.  This can be a substantial problem for light devices with limited battery capacities.  WebPush alleviates this problem by enabling a server to push notifications to the device instead of having the device regularly poll the server.  This is a first step towards more energy efficient devices, but is still not sufficient for enabling batteries to last weeks or months without recharging.</t></abstract>
