<abstract><t>The Internet Message Access Protocol [RFC3501] requires a client to initiate a LOGOUT command to close the network connection. However, it's often desirable to have the server initiate the termination of the network connection. This allows the network to deactivate a service provided to a client. This document specifies the syntax of a server-initiated LOGOUT command, which will allow a server to tell the client that the connection needs to be closed.</t></abstract>
