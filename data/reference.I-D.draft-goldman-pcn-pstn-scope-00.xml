<abstract><t>As the effort to develop the PCN charter draws to a conclusion, it seems helpful to have a touchstone of some concerns relative to the PSTN network and IP network Gateway in order to confirm that they are either in scope of the initial charter or will be addressed in future work. This attempt is motivated by a desire to avoid the accidental omission of a topic that may be hard to "retrofit" in later.</t></abstract>
