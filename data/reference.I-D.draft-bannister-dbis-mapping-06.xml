<abstract><t>This is one of several documents that describe the components within Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS).  DBIS provides a framework for the representation of data relating to TCP/IP and the UNIX system within [X.500] entries that have previously been stored in the Network Information Service [NIS]; so that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510].  The intention of DBIS is to extend, and thereby replace both NIS and the experimental protocol for using LDAP as a Network Information Service (RFC2307), which have both achieved widespread adoption.  DBIS consists of an LDAP schema, naming conventions and protocols to describe its use by DUAs requiring network service information. Client/server communication and server-side operations are entirely contained within the domain of LDAP.  Key aspects of DBIS and improvements over RFC2307 are:  - Schema is backwards compatible with NIS, including case sensitivity of key names.  - Standardisation of mapping information to increase portability of DUA implementations and to reduce duplication of client configuration data.  - Features added to increase flexibility in large complex environments:  o Maps may be joined from data located in different areas of the Directory Information Tree (DIT).  o Groups of DUAs may have variances in their data depending upon their host netgroup membership.  - Modular design to allow separate parts of the system to be replaced, improved or augmented separately in the future.  - Support added for automounter maps [draft-bannister-dbis- automounter-00].  This document describes mapping objects used by DBIS to locate and transform service information stored within the DIT.</t></abstract>
