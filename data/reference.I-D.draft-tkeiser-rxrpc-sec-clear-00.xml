<abstract><t>There are a number of anonymous RxRPC applications which require identity assertions in order to ensure that the desired peer receives and processes the procedure call.  This memo defines a replacement for the rxnull security class which provides a means for mutually agreeing upon who is communicating, without incurring cryptographic overhead.  It should be noted that, much like rxnull, this security object is not suitable for use in a distributed environment due to its inability to provide integrity protection.</t></abstract>
