<abstract><t>iCAN (instant Congestion Assessment Network) is a set of mechanisms running directly on network nodes:  o  To adjust the flows paths based on real-time measurement of the candidate paths.  o  The measurement is to reflect the congestion situation of each path, so that the ingress nodes could decide which flows need to be switched from a path to another.  This is something that current SDN and TE technologies can hardly achieve:  o  SDN Controller is slow and far from the data plane, it is neither able to assess the real-time congestion situation of each path, nor able to assure the data plane always go as expected (especially in SRv6 scenarios).  However, iCAN can work with SDN perfectly: controller planning multi-path transmission, and iCAN does the flow optimization automatically.  o  Traditional TE is not able to adjust the flow paths in real-time.</t></abstract>
