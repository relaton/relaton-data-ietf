<abstract><t>In the Split Network Virtualization Edge (Split-NVE) architecture, the functions of the NVE are split across a server and a piece of external network equipment that is called an &quot;External NVE&quot;.  The server-resident control-plane functionality resides in control software, which may be part of hypervisor or container-management software; for simplicity, this document refers to the hypervisor as the &quot;location&quot; of this software.</t><t>One or more control-plane protocols between a hypervisor and its associated External NVE(s) are used by the hypervisor to distribute its virtual-machine networking state to the External NVE(s) for further handling.  This document illustrates the functionality required by this type of control-plane signaling protocol and outlines the high-level requirements.  Virtual-machine states as well as state transitioning are summarized to help clarify the protocol requirements.</t></abstract>
