<abstract><t>Wireless network virtualization is one of the auspicious approach to address the increasing demand of mobile data services. It enables logically decoupling the traditional cellular network into infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). It also offers a virtualized wireless network (VWN), efficient resource utilization, and isolation between network slices (i.e., MVNOs). In this paper, we consider wireless network slicing for a single InP who owns radio resources and multiple MVNOs who need radio resources to provide specific services to their mobile users. One of the challenges in wireless network slicing is how to efficiently allocate the limited radio resources available at the InP to the MVNOs. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient allocation of the InP radio resources to the MVNOs which aims to maximize the total network capacity of the InP. To this end, we decompose our considered problem into two phases. The first phase is an efficient allocation of the InP radio resources (bandwidth) to the MVNOs, and the second phase is an optimal allocation of MVNOs resources gained from the InP to their mobile users. We then propose a Generalized Kelly Mechanism framework and the Karush-Kuhn- Tucker (KKT) conditions to solve the first and the second phase of our resource allocation problem, respectively.</t></abstract>
