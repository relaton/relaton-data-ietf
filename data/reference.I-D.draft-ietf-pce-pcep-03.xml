<abstract><t>This document specifies the Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs. Such interactions include path computation requests and path computation replies as well as notifications of specific states related to the use of a PCE in the context of MPLS and GMPLS Traffic Engineering. The PCEP protocol is designed to be flexible and extensible so as to easily allow for the addition of further messages and objects, should further requirements be expressed in the future.</t></abstract>
