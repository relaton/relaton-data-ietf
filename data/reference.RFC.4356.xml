<abstract><t>The cellular telephone industry has defined a service known as the Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS).  This service uses formats and protocols that are similar to, but differ in key ways from, those used in Internet mail.</t><t>One important difference between MMS and Internet Mail is that MMS uses headers that start with &quot;X-Mms-&quot; to carry a variety of user agent- and server-related information elements.</t><t>This document specifies how to exchange messages between these two services, including mapping information elements as used in MMS X-Mms-* headers as well as delivery and disposition reports, to and from that used in SMTP and Internet message headers.
