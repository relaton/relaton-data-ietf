<abstract><t>This memo proposes a SIP framework used for advertising and searching for shared files within a given community. The memo defines the signaling that users to announce the availability of files stored in their User Agents (UA). It also provides the signaling for users to perform searches of available files and monitor changes in those files. Additionally, this memo describes the signaling used to access a file. These methods can be used in (but are not limited to) SIP peer-to-peer systems based on centralized, semi-centralized or fully distributed architectures.</t></abstract>
