<abstract><t>A Traffic Engineering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group of Label Switching Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs.  Routing protocol (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions facilitate discovery of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) LSR TE mesh membership and automate the creation of a full mesh of TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  This document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group that applies to the scenarios where full mesh TE LSPs are not necessary and TE LSPs setup depends on the roles of LSRs in a TE mesh-group.  Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for automatic discovery of role-based TE mesh membership are defined accordingly.</t></abstract>
