<abstract><t>In transport networks, there are requirements where Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme needs to employ restoration Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping resources for the working and/or restoration LSPs reserved in the network after the failure occurs.  This document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided using Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in the context of GMPLS end- to-end recovery when using restoration LSP where failed LSP is not torn down.  This document compliments existing standards by explaining the missing pieces of information during the RSVP-TE signaling procedure in support of resource sharing-based LSP setup/teardown in GMPLS-controlled circuit networks.  No new procedures or mechanisms are defined by this document, and it is strictly informative in nature.</t></abstract>
