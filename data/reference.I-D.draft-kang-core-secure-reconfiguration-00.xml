<abstract><t>This document presents a secure method to configure a key for a node when it initially joins to network that is currently in operation. The method is suited for a scenario, where resource constrained objects are interconnected with each other and thus form a network called Internet of Things. It is assumed that communications for all nodes are based on TCP/IP protocols and some of the nodes use the constrained application protocol (CoAP). The method does not cover all operations of secure bootstrapping, but it is intended to securely support self-reconfiguration of the pre-installed temporary key of new node.</t></abstract>
