<abstract><t>A Generic Associated Channel (G-ACH) has been defined as an extension of the pseudowire Associated Channel Header (ACH) to enable the realization of a control/communication channel associated with Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs), MPLS pseudowires (PWs), MPLS LSP segments, and MPLS sections between adjacent MPLS-capable devices.  The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of the MPLS architecture that identifies elements of the MPLS toolkit that may be combined to build a carrier grade packet transport network based on MPLS packet switching technology.  This document describes how the G-ACH may be used to provide the infrastructure that forms part of the Management Communication Network (MCN) and a Signaling Communication Network (SCN). Collectively, the MCN and SCN may be referred to as the Data Communication Network (DCN). The document explains how MCN and SCN packets are encapsulated, carried on the G-ACH, and demultiplexed for</t></abstract>
