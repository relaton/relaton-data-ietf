<abstract><t>Is the concept of Domain Names owned by the DNS protocol or does the DNS protocol exist to support the Domain Names concept?  This question has become pertinent in light of proposals to use Domain Names in protocols in ways incompatible with the DNS protocol and the operational environment built to runthe protocol.  This document looks first at the early record in the RFC series and then expands to survey how Domain Names are used in protocols and reaches the conclusion that Domain Names are independent of the DNS, and further, that there might be a need to clarify the definition of Domain Names to reinforce that notion.</t></abstract>
