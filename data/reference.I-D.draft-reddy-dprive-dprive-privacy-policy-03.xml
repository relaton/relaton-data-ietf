<abstract><t>Users may want to control how their DNS queries are handled by DNS servers so they can configure their system to use DNS servers that comply with their privacy and DNS filtering expectations.  This document defines a mechanism for a DNS server to communicate its privacy statement URL and filtering policy to a DNS client.  This communication is cryptographically signed to attest its authenticity. By evaluating the DNS privacy statement, filtering policy and the signatory, the user can choose a DNS server that best supports his/ her desired privacy and filtering policy.  This token is particularly useful for DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers that are either public resolvers or are discovered on a local network.</t></abstract>
