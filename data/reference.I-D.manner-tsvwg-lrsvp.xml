<abstract><t>Guaranteed QoS for multimedia applications is based on reserved resources in each node on the end-to-end path. Even if the correspondent node does not support QoS, it would be useful to be able to reserve at least local resources at the access network, e.g., wireless link resources. Additionally, for mobile nodes the continuity of QoS is disturbed due to end-to-end signaling or slow re-reservations of resources after each handover. This draft proposes a simple enhancement to RSVP, so that initial resource reservations and re-reservations, e.g., due to host mobility can be done locally in an access network.</t></abstract>
