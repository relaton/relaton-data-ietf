<abstract><t>This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism tailored for residual deployment of public IPv4 via IPv6 networks (the reverse of 6rd whose purpose is rapid deployment of IPv6 via IPv4).  In order to deal with the IPv4-address shortage, customers can be assigned shared IPv4 addresses with statically assigned restricted port sets. Operation is stateless, with no per-customer state in network nodes.  4rd-U unifies in a synthesis features of double-translation-based solutions (in particular compatibility with some IPv6-only middle-box tools inside IPv6 networks), and those of IP-in-IP encapsulation solutions (in particular complete end-to-end transparency to IPv4 packets).  It is proposed as a unified standard replacing the two standards that are otherwise envisaged.</t></abstract>
