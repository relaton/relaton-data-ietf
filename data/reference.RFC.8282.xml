<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computation functions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.</t><t>MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed from layered service networks.  It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers through a process called inter-layer traffic engineering.  PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements.</t><t>The PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) is designed as a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs.  This document presents PCEP extensions for inter-layer traffic engineering.</t></abstract>
