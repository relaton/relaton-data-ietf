<abstract><t>This document is intended to provide additional guidance to operators of end-systems, operators of networks, and researchers beyond that provided in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id] and [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-aqm-dualq-coupled] in order to ensure successful deployment of L4S [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-l4s-arch] in the Internet.  The focus of this document is on potential interactions between L4S flows and Classic ECN ([RFC3168]) flows in Classic ECN bottleneck links. The document discusses the potential outcomes of these interactions, describes mechanisms to detect the presence of [RFC3168] bottlenecks, and identifies opportunites to prevent and/or detect and resolve fairness problems in such networks.</t></abstract>
