<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. Extensions to the MPLS and GMPLS signaling and routing protocols have been made in support of traffic engineered point-to-multipoint (P2MP) label switched paths (LSPs). Since P2MP LSP routes are sometimes complex to compute, and given the use of PCE in MPLS networks it is likely that PCE will be used in P2MP MPLS networks. Generic requirements for a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in "PCE Communication Protocol Generic Requirements". This document complements the generic requirements and presents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements for point-to-multipoint traffic engineering.</t></abstract>
