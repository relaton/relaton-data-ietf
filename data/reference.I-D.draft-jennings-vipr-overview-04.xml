<abstract><t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deployment within individual domains, typically supporting voice and video communications.  Though it was designed from the outset to support inter-domain federation over the public Internet, such federation has not materialized.  The primary reasons for this are the complexities of inter-domain phone number routing and concerns over security. This document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements, and then describes a new model and technique for inter-domain federation with SIP involving the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), called Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (VIPR).  VIPR addresses the problems that have prevented inter-domain federation over the Internet.  It provides fully distributed inter-domain routing for phone numbers, authorized mappings from phone numbers to domains, a new technique for automated SIP anti-spam, and privacy of number ownership, all while preserving the trapezoidal model of SIP.</t></abstract>
