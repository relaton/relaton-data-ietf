<abstract><t>The temporary addresses described by RFC4941 makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to track the hosts,but also bring trouble to the network administrators:"when the network is in trouble,it is difficult to find out which host is attacking the other hosts."So some network administrators don't hope that the hosts use the temporary addresses. This document provides a solution to these network administrators,and they can specify whether the prefixes can be used to generate the temporary addresses.</t></abstract>
