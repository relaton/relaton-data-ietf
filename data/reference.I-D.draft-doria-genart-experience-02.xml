<abstract><t>The General Area Review team has been doing Reviews of Internet Drafts since 2004.  This draft discusses the experience and the lessons learned over the past 4+ years of this process.  The review team initially did reviews before each of the IESG telechats. Beginning in late 2005, review team members have been assigned to review documents during IETF Last Call, unless no IETF Last Call is necessary for the document.  The same reviewer then reviews any updates when the document is placed on an IESG telechat agenda.</t></abstract>
