<abstract><t>The privacy requirement of anonymity is much harder to achieve than security goals like confidentiality or authentication, since network routing has to take place between well known spots of the network. There are solutions providing anonymity on the Internet implemented on the application level, but there's also a possibility to achieve local anonymity on Ethernet networks without the introduction of new anonymous protocols by following a protocol anonymizing approach described in this document. Protocol anonymization is a simple network operation mode, which can provide local client anonymity on Ethernet networks under certain circumstances by eliminating the host identification capabilities of widely used local network protocols.</t></abstract>
