<abstract><t>This document presents a framework to assist the writers of policy or practice statements and the designers of a Public Key Infrastructure to prepare disaster recovery plans in case of a private key-compromise or a private key-loss. This may happen to end-entity keys, Certification Authorities, Revocation Authorities, Attribute Authorities, or Time-Stamping Authorities. Since certificates have finite validity, CA key-rollover should be planned in advance. In addition, denial of service attacks on Repositories holding CRLs has also to be considered. This framework provides a comprehensive list of potential key- compromise or key-loss conditions that, in the opinion of the authors, should be addressed so that it is possible to quickly recover from exceptional situations.</t></abstract>
