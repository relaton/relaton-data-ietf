<abstract><t>The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the first version of the Condensed Network Management Protocol (CNMP) Framework. This Framework follows the Internet-Standard Management Framework (SNMPv3), but CNMP provides a more efficient encoding of data by using Octet Encoding Rules (OER) coupled with a more compact set of message structures, including a set of "dynamic objects", which are defined at runtime, as originally used by the Simple Transportation Management Protocol (STMP).  The document is intended to provide an option to using SNMPv3 and is not intended to replace SNMPv3.  SNMPv3 will continue to offer the advantage of providing a conceptually simple protocol, whereas CNMP allows more compact messaging in high volume and bandwidth constrained environments.</t></abstract>
