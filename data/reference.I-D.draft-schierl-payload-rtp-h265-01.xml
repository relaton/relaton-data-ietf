<abstract><t>This memo describes an RTP payload format for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) [HEVC], which is currently being developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC).  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer  (NAL)  units  in  each  RTP  packet  payload,  as  well  as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets.  Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP flows. The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing,  Internet  video  streaming,  and  high  bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.</t></abstract>
