<abstract><t>This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol that allows for faster crash recovery using a saved token method.  When an IPsec tunnel between two IKEv2 implementations is disconnected due to a restart of one peer, it can take as much as several minutes to recover.  In this text we propose an extension to the protocol, that allows for recovery within a few seconds of the reboot.</t></abstract>
