<abstract><t>Although TRILL is based on IS-IS, which supports multilevel unicast routing, extending TRILL to multiple levels has challenges that are not addressed by the already-existing capabilities of IS-IS.  One issue is with the handling of multi-destination packet distribution trees.  Other issues are with TRILL switch nicknames.  How are such nicknames allocated across a multilevel TRILL network?  Do nicknames need to be unique across an entire multilevel TRILL network?  Or can they merely be unique within each multilevel area?</t><t>This informational document enumerates and examines alternatives based on a number of factors including backward compatibility, simplicity, and scalability; it makes recommendations in some cases.</t></abstract>
