<abstract><t>This document specifies the protocol extensions for support of Differentiated-Service-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE). This includes generalization of the semantic of a number of IGP extensions already defined for existing MPLS Traffic Engineering in RFC3630 and RFC-TBD as well as additional IGP extensions beyond those. This also includes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling beyond those already specified in RFC3209 for existing MPLS Traffic Engineering. These extensions address the Requirements for DS-TE spelt out in RFC3564.</t></abstract>
