<abstract><t>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a XML representation for information about computer security incidents. The driver for the standardization effort for IODEF is the desire to share the information as part of the cybersecurity response.  As the security considerations of RFC5070 notes, the data can be sensitive and should only be disclosed to appropriate parties.  This document describes how to use the Plasma policy enforcement model to ensure access to the IODEF data follows the appropriate policies in a distributed environment and independent of the transports used to share the information.</t></abstract>
