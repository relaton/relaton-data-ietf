<abstract><t>This document proposes a Context-Aware Navigator Protocol (CAN) for IP-based vehicular networks for cooperative navigation among vehicles in road networks.  This CAN aims at the enhancement of driving safety through a light-weight driving information sharing method.  The CAN protocol uses an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) option to convey driving information such as a vehicle's position, speed, acceleration/deceleration, and direction, and a driver's driving action (e.g., braking and accelerating).</t></abstract>
