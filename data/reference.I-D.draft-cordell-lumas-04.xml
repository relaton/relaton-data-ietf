<abstract><t>A number of methods and tools are available for defining the format of messages used for application protocols. However, many of these methods and tools have been designed for purposes other than message definition, and have been adopted on the basis that they are available rather than being ideally suited to the task. This often means that the methods make it difficult to get definitions correct, or result in unnecessary complexity and verbosity both in the definition and on the wire. Lumas - Language for Universal Message Abstraction and Specification - has been custom designed for the purpose of message definition. It is thus easy to specify messages in a compact, extensible format that is readily machine manipulated to produce a compact encoding on the wire.</t></abstract>
