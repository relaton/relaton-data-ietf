<title>Clarifications and Extensions for the Bootstrap Protocol</title>
<author initials='W.' surname='Wimer' fullname='W. Wimer'><organization /></author>
<date year='1993' month='October' />
<abstract><t>Some aspects of the BOOTP protocol were rather loosely defined in its original specification.  In particular, only a general description was provided for the behavior of &quot;BOOTP relay agents&quot; (originally called BOOTP forwarding agents&quot;).  The client behavior description also suffered in certain ways.  This memo attempts to clarify and strengthen the specification in these areas. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
