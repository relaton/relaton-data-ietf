<abstract><t>The FMIPv6 specification currently does not explicitly define the operation over Point-to-Point links. In this document we define FMIPv6 operation over the point-to-point links, especially we propose mechanism for assigning unique prefixes to the MN by the PAR. Three different solutions are proposed. A new access router dynamically assigns a unique prefix called dedicated prefix to any MN that is performing a handover. Alternatively, the previous access router sends an aggregate prefix of a new access router to MN for formulating NCoA, and only when handover takes place, the new access router assigns a dedicated prefix to MN and configures a NCoA for the MN. Lastly, MN is allowed to generate a special NCoA without any specific prefix information, and only when handover takes place, the new access router assigns a dedicated prefix to MN for NCoA formulation. Both reactive and predictive modes of FMIPv6 are explained.</t></abstract>
