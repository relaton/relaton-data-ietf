<abstract><t>An increasing diversity of Web-connected devices and software capabilities has created a need to deliver optimized content for each device.  This specification defines a set of HTTP request header fields, colloquially known as Client Hints, to address this.  They are intended to be used as input to proactive content negotiation; just as the Accept header allows clients to indicate what formats they prefer, Client Hints allow clients to indicate a list of device and agent specific preferences.</t></abstract>
