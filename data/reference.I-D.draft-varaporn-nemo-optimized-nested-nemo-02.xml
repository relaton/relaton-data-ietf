<abstract><t>In nested mobile networks (NEMO), packets that are routed from/to any nodes inside the nested NEMO have additional overheads (i.e., bi- directional tunnels) and delays. These additional overheads and delays increase respectively to the depth of the current location of the node in nested NEMO since the packets have to go through all the    HAs of the MRs along the path to an endpoint. This draft provides a solution to this problem, providing optimizations to the nested NEMO concept thereby making it worthwhile to implement the nested NEMO concept.</t></abstract>
