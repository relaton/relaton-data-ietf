<abstract><t>MPTCP proxies and anchors are network-based functions, which support MPTCP connections.  The MPTCP proxy provides multipath support for MPTCP-capable hosts on behalf of their MPTCP-unaware peers.  This facilitates incremental deployment of MPTCP.  The MPTCP anchor permits subflow establishment for MPTCP connections when direct interaction between end hosts fails.  This permits tolerance to local IP protocol restrictions and it provides robustness in case of break- before-make mobility events.  MPTCP proxies and anchors are especially suited for wireless access environments.</t></abstract>
