<abstract><t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows calls to both addresses of record (AORs) such as sip:alice@example.com and telephone numbers with either sip or tel schemes such as tel:+12127771234. As opposed to the AOR where the domain specifies the exact location or realm of the user and a reject code provides enough visiblity to the calling party to exit gracefully (e.g. a 404 indicates that there is no point in trying further as the requested user either does not exist or is offline with no voicemail) with telephone numbers (TNs) this is not the case. With more and more TNs representing actual IP endpoints there is a need to differentiate in an error code between rejecting a call due to a misdialed number (i.e. the number does not exist) and a number that is just not associated with an IP endpoint (for example in a case where there is no billing relationship and as such the rejecting proxy cannot forward to a PSTN termination provider. This specification defines a new SIP response code (No Service Reject - nsr) for this purpose.</t></abstract>
