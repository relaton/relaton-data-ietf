<abstract><t>In various situations, such as TV broadcasting with several regional sources, it is required to setup a series of Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) between a set of head-end Label Switching Routers (LSRs) and a group of leaf LSRs referred to as a Leaf Group. Setting up such a series of P2MP TE LSPs requires for the set of head-end LSRs to be aware of all leaf LSRs, which may lead to the cumbersome configuration of a potentially large number of leaf LSRs on each head-end LSRs. Furthermore leaf LSRs may want to dynamically join or leave a Leaf Group without requiring manual configuration on the head-end LSRs. This document specifies IGP routing extensions for IS-IS and OSPF so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of leaf LSRs members of a Leaf Group, in order to automate the creation and modification of a series of P2MP TE-LSPs.</t></abstract>
