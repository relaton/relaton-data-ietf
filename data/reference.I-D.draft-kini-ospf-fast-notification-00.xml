<abstract><t>Several applications could use a mechanism to quickly notify one or more routers about control-protocol events. Current mechanisms to convey such information to routers multiple hops away involves hop- by-hop protocol-specific control plane processing as well as hop-by- hop control plane forwarding. The delay due to control planes involvement in processing/forwarding, adversely affects the application's goal (e.g. fast convergence). This document describes a framework to use data plane forwarding to convey control protocol information multiple hops away. It also defines some sample applications within this framework.</t></abstract>
