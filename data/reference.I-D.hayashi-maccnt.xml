<abstract><t>This I-D describes problems on accounting issues in multicasting. General requirements for accounting capabilities including QoS related issues are listed. This I-D assumes that these capabilities can be realized by appropriate functions implemented at edges of a network based on IGMP or MLD. Such functions would log in a dedicated database information obtained from edge routers. Finally, a case for CDN services is described as an application example which could benefit from multicasting with accounting capabilities. It is proposed that this I-D be used as a starting point for further discussion on these issues.</t></abstract>
