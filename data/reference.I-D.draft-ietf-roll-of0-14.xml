<abstract><t>The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) specification defines a generic Distance Vector protocol that is adapted to a variety of networks types by the application of specific Objective Functions.  An Objective Function defines how a RPL node selects and optimizes routes within a RPL Instance based on the information objects available.  This document specifies a basic Objective Function that relies only on the objects that are defined in RPL and does not use any extension.</t></abstract>
