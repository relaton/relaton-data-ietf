<abstract><t>This document proposes a template for authors of EAP methods that rely on shared keys, to document their work. Since EAP methods have proliferated but only 4 are currently standardized and since no simple shared key EAP method seems to be widely available to replace EAP-MD5 that has been deprecated for security reasons, this template is the first step towards standardizing such an EAP method. This document is indeed intended to help gather information on the existing related work before requesting that a new work item be opened at IETF to standardize a replacement for EAP-MD5.</t></abstract>
