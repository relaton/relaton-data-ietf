<abstract><t>Reliabilty is one of the essential requirements in data transmission network. In the traditional IP/TCP network, TCP provides end to end reliable transmission. Due to the high burst loss probability in Optical Burst Switching (OBS) Network, if we leave the retransmission work to the uppper IP/TCP layer, the network may be overloaded. Besides the simple retransmission in the IP/TCP network, OBS network which builds on Wavelength Division Mutiplexing system has a new retransmission scheme -- alternate wavelength retransmission. With the information of network status collected in the edge nodes, retransmission in the OBS network is more efficient and delay is shorter. Also TCP and OBS retransmission can work together which is called multi-layer retransmission.</t></abstract>
