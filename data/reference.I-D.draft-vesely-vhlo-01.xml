<abstract><t>This memo defines an extension to the SMTP service whereby an SMTP client can know beforehand the reputation and whitelisting treatment for the messages that it is about to transmit.  SMTP level support for anti-spam protocols implies that the sending part does its best to ease checking, possibly at the expense of some flexibility.  In exchange, the receiving part lets the sender know whether its message is whitelisted, thereby recovering reliability.</t></abstract>
