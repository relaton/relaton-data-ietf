<abstract><t>The Problem of AAA-based key management for facilitating secure handovers in a wireless mobile environment has been described in [I-D.nakhjiri-aaa-hokey-ps]. The intention with this document is to provide a starting point for developing a solution for that problem by introducing a key hierarchy using EAP generated keys. An example of how the channel binding problem can be solved is also added in an appendix.</t></abstract>
