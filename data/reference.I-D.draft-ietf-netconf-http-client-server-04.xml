<abstract><t>This document defines two YANG modules: the first defines a minimal grouping for configuring an HTTP client, and the second defines a minimal grouping for configuring an HTTP server.  It is intended that these groupings will be used to help define the configuration for simple HTTP-based protocols (not for complete web servers or browsers).
