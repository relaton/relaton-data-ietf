<abstract><t>The ROLL Working Group was recently chartered by the IETF to define routing characteristics for low power embedded devices.  ROLL would like to serve the Industrial, Commercial (Building), Home and Urban markets.  Pursuant to this effort, this document defines the  functional requirements for installing integrated facility management systems in commercial facilities.  The body of this document defines the routing requirements for commercial building application.  Other commercial building requirements such as cost and installation requirements have been included in Appendix A for reference.</t></abstract>
