<abstract><t>This document considers a VPN Client setting a VPN with a security gateway where at least one of the peer has multiple interfaces.  With the current IKEv2, the outer IP addresses of the VPN are determined by those used by IKEv2 channel.  As a result using multiple interface requires to set an IKEv2 channel on each interface, and then on each paths if both the VPN Client and the security gateway have multiple interfaces.  Setting multiple IKEv2 channel involves multiple authentications which MAY each require multiple round trips and delay the VPN establishment.  In addition multiple authentications unnecessarily load the VPN client and the authentication infrastructure.  This document presents the KEEP_OLD_IKE_SA extension, where an additional IKEv2 channel from an already authenticated IKEv2 channel. The newly created IKEv2 channel is set without the IKEv2 authentication exchange.  The newly created IKEv2 channel can then be assigned to another interface using MOBIKE.</t></abstract>
