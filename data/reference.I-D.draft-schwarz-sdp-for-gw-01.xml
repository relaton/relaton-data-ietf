<abstract><t>SDP is used in many signalling protocols at call control level (such as SAP, SIP, BICC), bearer control level (such as RTSP, IPBCP) and gateway control level (such as H.248/MEGACO, MGCP). Scope of this RFC is related to gateway control specific SDP usage. Gateway control protocols do usually NOT define and introduce any new SDP parameters, however, gateway control protocols need specific SDP parameter values in addition to SDP usage at call or bearer control level. Such SDP codepoints are collected by this RFC with the purpose of registration with IANA.</t></abstract>
