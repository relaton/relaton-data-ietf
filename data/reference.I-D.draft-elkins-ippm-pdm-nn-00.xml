<abstract><t>Monitoring of net neutrality is of interest to regulators as well as users throughout the world.  Standardized metrics are lacking. Measurements need to be at the end user client, be able to accurately separate wire and host time, detect quality of service provided to individual applications and be lightweight.  The IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination Option meets all these criteria. We propose that PDM be used for such measurements.  A gap analysis shows that PDM is available for IPv6 only and not for IPv4 or low powered devices.</t></abstract>
