<abstract><t>This document describes a neighborhood discovery protocol (NHDP) for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). The protocol provides each MANET node with local topology up to two hops distant, describing a node's 1-hop neighbors and symmetric 2-hop neighbors. This is achieved through periodic message exchange. This neighborhood discovery protocol may be used by any MANET protocols which need neighborhood information. The protocol imposes minimum requirements to the network by not requiring sequenced or reliable transmission of control traffic.</t></abstract>
