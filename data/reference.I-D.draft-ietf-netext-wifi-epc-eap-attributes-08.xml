<abstract><t>With WiFi emerging as a trusted access network for service providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly available in 3G and 4G networks in WiFi access networks as well.  Such functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections and seamless mobility between WiFi and 3G/4G networks.
