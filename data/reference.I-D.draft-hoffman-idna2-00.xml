<abstract><t>IDNA has been a world-wide success since it was introduced over five years ago.  However, it has some notable deficiencies, including being tied to an old version of the Unicode standard and needless restrictions that prevented some languages from being used.  This document describes IDNA version 2, which rectifies those problems while making the fewest changes necessary to the original protocol.</t></abstract>
