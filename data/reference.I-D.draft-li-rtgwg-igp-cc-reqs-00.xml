<abstract><t>Interior Gateway Protocol(IGP) such as IS-IS or OSPF is a fundamental building block for traditional routing system which is based on distributed computation model.  Routing in networks based on centralized computation model such as Software Defined Network(SDN) may require special IGP extension to facilitate its operation in multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks.  This document introduces an architecture of deploying IGP for central-controlled network, but it does not aim to provide a detailed description of all the architectural components.  It also specifies a set of functional requirements which can be fulfilled by IGP with proper extension for the central-controlled network.</t></abstract>
