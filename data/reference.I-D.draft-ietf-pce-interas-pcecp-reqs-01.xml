<abstract><t>Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineered (MPLS-TE) LabelSwitched Paths (LSPs) may be established wholly within an Autonomous System (AS) or may cross AS boundaries. The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a component that is capable of computing paths for MPLS-TE LSPs. The PCE Communication Protocol(PCECP) is defined to allow communication between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs, and between PCEs. The PCECP is used to request paths and to supply computed paths in responses. Generic requirements for the PCECP are set out in "Path Computation Element(PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements", RFC 4657. This document extends those requirements to cover the use of PCECP in support of inter-AS MPLS-TE.</t></abstract>
