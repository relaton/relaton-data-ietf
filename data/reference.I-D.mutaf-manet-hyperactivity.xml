<abstract><t>The optimization offered by reactive routing relies on the observation that under normal activity a host makes a low rate of outgoing sessions to new or different hosts, and connections are locally correlated. This contrasts the fundamental behavior of address scanning worms that search for new hosts to infect at high speeds. Consequently, each infected node will frequently flood the network with route request messages targeted at possibly non-existing addresses.</t></abstract>
