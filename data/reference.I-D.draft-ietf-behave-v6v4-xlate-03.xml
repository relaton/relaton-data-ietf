<abstract><t>This document specifies an update to the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm (SIIT) described in RFC 2765.  The algorithm translates between IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers (including ICMP headers).  This specification addresses both a stateless and a stateful mode. In the stateless mode, translation information is carried in the address itself, permitting both IPv4->IPv6 and IPv6->IPv4 session establishment without maintaining state in the IP/ICMP translator. In the stateful mode, translation state is maintained between IPv4 address/transport port tuples and IPv6 address/transport port tuples, enabling IPv6 systems to open sessions with IPv4 systems.  The choice of operational mode is made by the operator deploying the network and is critical to the operation of the applications using it.  Significant issues exist in the stateless and stateful modes that are not addressed in this document, related to the address assignment and the maintenance of the translation tables, respectively.  This document confines itself to the actual translation.  Acknowledgement of previous work  This document is a product of the 2008-2009 effort to define a replacement for NAT-PT.  It is an update to and directly derivative from Erik Nordmark's [RFC2765], which similarly provides both stateless and stateful translation between IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC2460], and between ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443].  The original document was a product of the NGTRANS working group.  The changes in this document reflect five components:  1.  Redescribing the network model to map to present and projected  usage [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-framework].  2.  Moving the address format to the address format document  [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format], to coordinate with other drafts  on the topic.  3.  Describing both stateful and stateless operation. 4.  Some changes in ICMP.  5.  Updating references.  Requirements</t></abstract>
