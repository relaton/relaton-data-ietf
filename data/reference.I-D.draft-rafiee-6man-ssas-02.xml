<abstract><t>The default method for IPv6 address generation uses an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) assigned by the IEEE Standards Association and an Extension Identifier assigned to the hardware manufacturer [1] (section 2.5.1 RFC-4291) [RFC4291]. This means that a node will always have the same Interface ID (IID) whenever it connects to a new network. Since the node's IP address does not change, the node is vulnerable to privacy related attacks. To address this problem there are currently two mechanisms being used to randomize the IID that do not use the MAC address or other unique values in the IID generation; Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [RFC3972] and Privacy Extension [RFC4941]. The problem with the former approach is the computational cost involved for the IID generation and verification. The problem with the latter approach is that it lacks the necessary security and provides the node with only partial protection against privacy related attacks. This document proposes the use of a new algorithm for use in the generation of the IID while, at the same time, securing the node against some types of attack, like IP spoofing. These attacks are prevented with the addition of a signature to the messages sent over the network and by direct use of a public key in the IP address.</t></abstract>
