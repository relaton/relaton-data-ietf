<abstract><t>This document defines a central policy controlling network-based mobility management solution through Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA), and policy controller interactions between Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities(both Mobile Access Gateway and Local Mobility Anchor) under an AAA server and policy server group within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain. The AAA and policy interactions are not only used to download and update mobile node specific user data information between Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities and a remote policy store, but also update the local mobility anchor about the current location of the mobile node instead of signaling messages between the mobile access gateway and local mobility anchor.</t></abstract>
