<abstract><t>In this draft, we propose an analysis of a Path Computation Element Metric Protocol (PCEMP) that acts as a generic computation model for path based metrics in large multi-domain or multi-layer networks. The mechanism that is described in this draft is generic and can serve as an application path computation framework for any Path Computation Element (PCE). We describe a protocol message format for PCE-PCC and PCE-PCE communications derived from this computation model. This draft proposes to elucidate protocol independent metrics defining path quality measurement criteria, algorithm complexity and scalability criteria related to path computation techniques through the PCEMP along with a PCE peer communication protocol and is in line with the PCE WG Charter.</t></abstract>
