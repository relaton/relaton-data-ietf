<abstract><t>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows a planned change to the data in the LoST server to occur.  Records that previously were valid will become invalid at a date in the future, and new locations will become valid after the date.  The extension adds two elements to the &lt;findservice> request: a URI to be used to inform the LIS that previously valid locations will be invalid after the planned change date, and add a date which requests the server to perform validation as of the date specified.</t></abstract>
