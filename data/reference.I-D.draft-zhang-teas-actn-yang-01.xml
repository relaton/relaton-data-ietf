<abstract><t>Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) refers to the set of virtual network operations needed to orchestrate, control and manage large-scale multi-domain TE networks, so as to facilitate network programmability, automation, efficient resource sharing, and end-to- end virtual service aware connectivity and network function virtualization services.  This document explains how the different types of YANG models defined in the Operations and Management Area and in the Routing Area are applicable to the ACTN framework. This document also shows how the ACTN architecture can be satisfied using classes of data model that have already been defined, and discusses the applicability of specific data models that are under development. It also highlights where new data models may need to be developed.</t></abstract>
