<abstract><t>The use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that the identities to be used to authenticate are configured on the client device. Achieving this requires software on that device (either built into the operating system or a standalone utility) that will interact with the user, and manage the user's identities and credential-to-service mappings.  Anyone designing that software will face the same set of challenges.  This document aims to document these challenges with the aim of producing well-thought out UIs with some degree of consistency.</t></abstract>
