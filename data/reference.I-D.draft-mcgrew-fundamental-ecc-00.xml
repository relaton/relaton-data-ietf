<abstract><t>This note describes the fundamental algorithms of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) as they are defined in some early references. These descriptions may be useful to those who want to implement the fundamental algorithms without using any of the specialized methods that were developed in following years.  Only elliptic curves based on fields of character greater than three are in scope.</t></abstract>
