<abstract><t>RFC 7908 provides a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerates several types of route leaks.  This document first examines which of those route-leak types are detected and mitigated by the existing origin validation (OV) [RFC 6811].  It is recognized that OV offers a limited detection and mitigation capability against route leaks.  This document specifies enhancements that significantly extend the route-leak prevention, detection, and mitigation capabilities of BGP.  One solution component involves intra-AS messaging from ingress router to egress router using a BGP Community or Attribute.  This intra-AS messaging prevents the AS from causing route leaks.  Another solution component involves carrying a per-hop route-leak protection (RLP) field in BGP updates.  The RLP fields are proposed to be carried in a new optional transitive attribute, called BGP RLP attribute.  The RLP attribute helps with detection and mitigation of route leaks at ASes downstream from the leaking AS.</t></abstract>
