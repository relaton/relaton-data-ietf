<abstract><t>The need for high quality routing for Low power and Lossy Network (L2N) such as sensor networks comprised of highly constrained devices (CPU, memory, ...) in sometimes unstable wireless environments is critical now and will continue to increase. Interest in this class of applications has grown dramatically in recent years and a routing solution addressing the specific environments of such networks is highly required considering the numerous, incompatible open-source and proprietary routing protocols as well as several industrial forums. The aim of this document is to define the routing requirements for Sensor Networks at the IP layer. Such routing protocol(s) would need to address several unique aspects of this class of embedded devices and would operate in networks comprising links of various nature.</t></abstract>
