<abstract><t>Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such as video gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers used to provide application services are distributed geographically around a network, many decisions made in the control and management of application services, such as where to instantiate another service instance or to which server a new client is assigned, should be made with the knowledge of the underlying network resources availability and the application resources conditions.  Currently such decisions are made with very little or no information concerning the underlying network used to deliver those services. Hence such decisions are inherently sub-optimal. In addition the lack of network awareness may result in not meeting the end-user application service objectives.</t></abstract>
