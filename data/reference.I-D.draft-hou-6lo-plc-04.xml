<abstract><t>Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially smart meters for electricity.  The inherent advantage of existing electricity infrastructure facilitates the expansion of PLC deployments, and moreover, a wide variety of accessible devices raises the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications.  This document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained PLC networks, such as ITU-T G.9903, IEEE 1901.1, IEEE 1901.2 and IEEE 1901.2a.</t></abstract>
