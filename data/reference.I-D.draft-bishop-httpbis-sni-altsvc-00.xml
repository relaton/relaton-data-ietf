<abstract><t>HTTP Alternative Services [AltSvc] provides a mechanism for an origin to declare that its content is accessible via some other combination of host, port, and protocol.  In the process of using such an alternative, an observer can identify that the client is requesting resources from a particular hostname.  This document extends HTTP Alternative Services, in combination with Secondary Certificate Authentication ([SecondaryCerts]), to enable clients not to disclose the origin to which they intend to connect.</t></abstract>
