<abstract><t>The IETF's standard congestion control schemes have been widely shown to be inadequate for various environments (e.g., high-speed or wireless networks). Recent research has yielded many alternate congestion control schemes. Using these new congestion control schemes in the global Internet has possible ramifications to both the network and to traffic using the currently standardized congestion control. Therefore, the IETF must proceed with caution when dealing with alternate congestion control proposals. The goal of this document is to provide guidance for considering alternate congestion control algorithms within the IETF.</t></abstract>
