<abstract><t>The IPv6 128-bit addressing architecture was designed as a successor for IPv4. But, IPv4 deployment in the global Internet continues via private addressing domains behind Network Address Translators (NATs) such that long-term coexistence with IPv6 addressing and minimal perturbation of IPv4 networks is emerging as the dominant strategy. This document proposes a long-term IPv6/IPv4 coexistence scheme called: IPvLX - IP with virtual Link Extension.</t></abstract>
