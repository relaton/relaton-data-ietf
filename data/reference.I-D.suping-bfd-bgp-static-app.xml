<abstract><t>This document describes the use of the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol with BGP and the static route over IPv4 or IPv6. The main purpose of this draft is to solve the BFD bootstrap problem with BGP and static routes. As to the encapsulation and demultiplexing issues there have been descriptions in BFD single hop draft [BFD-1HOP] and multi-hop draft [BFD-MULI]. With the BFD interaction with BGP graceful restart, the rules described in BFD single hop [BFD-1HOP] with IS-IS and OSPF graceful restart are also applicable to the BFD with BGP graceful restart, and will not iteratein in this draft. Comments on this draft should be directed to rtg-bfd@ietf.org or to author directly.</t></abstract>
