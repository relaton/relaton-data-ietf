<abstract><t>A number of protocols have been defined at the IETF to handle IP mobility and multi-homing - each of the defined protocols satisfies a different set of requirements - however, there is an overlap on some of the requirements and features among many of these protocols. In practice, a combination of the protocols are likely to be deployed in a system. There are various such combinations plausible, but some combinations are more realistic than others. This document analyzes the overall mobility and multi-homing architecture and highlights some key points to consider while deploying an architecture consisting of one or more of these protocols. The protocols considered in scope for this document include Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4), Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6), Network-based Local Mobility Management (NetLMM), MOBIKE, Host Identity Protocol (HIP), and Shim6.</t></abstract>
