<abstract><t>IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer traffic Optimization) that includes a "Network Map Service", an "Endpoint Cost Service" and an "Endpoint (EP) Ranking Service" and thus incentives for application clients to connect to ISP preferred Endpoints.  These services provide a view of the Network Provider (NP) topology to overlay clients.  The present draft proposes a light way to extend the information provided by the current ALTO protocol.  The purpose is to broaden the possibilities of the Application Clients in two ways: firstly by providing a better mapping of the Selected Endpoints to needs of the growing diversity of Content Networking Applications and to the network conditions, secondly by producing a more robust choice of multiple Endpoints, helping thus out for efficient Multi-Path transfer.  There are 2 parts in this draft: the first part proposes protocol extensions to support requests on multiple CostTypes in 1 transaction; the second part proposes additional CostTypes and Cost attributes such as valitity period, timeframe and reliability.</t></abstract>
