<abstract><t>The most common user applications for data communication (including web browsing and e-mail) lack a method for name resolution in multi- hop wireless ad-hoc networks of mobile nodes (MANETs). While the Domain Name System (DNS) works well on the fixed Internet, it represents a centralized approach to name resolution, which is not suitable for MANETs. This document specifies a straightforward solution for name resolution lookup in on-demand MANETs, i.e. MANETs that are routed with a reactive routing protocol, such as DSR [DSR] or AODV [AODV]. Names are resolved locally within the MANET with a mechanism similar to multicast DNS or LLMNR on a link. Although names resolved locally normally will have preference, MANET nodes that have access to external networks may complement the local name resolution by injecting into the MANET lookup results resolved by a conventional DNS server. The proposed solution applies equally well to IPv4 or IPv6.</t></abstract>
