<abstract><t>ETR Address Forwarding (EAF) is a novel method by which an IPv4 Core- Edge Separation solution to the Internet's routing scaling problem can tunnel packets from an ITR to an ETR.  EAF involves using 31 bits of the IPv4 header for new purposes: bit 48, the More Fragments flag, the Fragment Offset field and the Header Checksum field. Consequently, packets in this format need to be handled by routers with upgraded functionality.  EAF is an alternative to encapsulation and has advantages including: simpler ITRs and ETRs, direct support for conventional RFC 1191 PMTUD, no encapsulation overhead and full compatibility with IPsec AH and Traceroute.</t></abstract>
