<abstract><t>The submission profile of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) provides a standard way for an email client to submit a complete message for delivery. The chunking extension provides a way for a client to compose a message for submission from a series of client provided pieces. This specification further extends the chunking facility so that a client can compose a message from additional sources. For example, a client could use this facility to forward a message from an IMAP server or forward a web page as an attachment to a new message.</t></abstract>
