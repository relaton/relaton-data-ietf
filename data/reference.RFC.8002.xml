<abstract><t>The Certificate (CERT) parameter is a container for digital certificates.  It is used for carrying these certificates in Host Identity Protocol (HIP) control packets.  This document specifies the certificate parameter and the error signaling in case of a failed verification.  Additionally, this document specifies the representations of Host Identity Tags (HITs) in X.509 version 3 (v3).</t><t>The concrete use cases of certificates, including how certificates are obtained and requested and which actions are taken upon successful or failed verification, are specific to the scenario in which the certificates are used.  Hence, the definition of these scenario-specific aspects is left to the documents that use the CERT parameter.</t><t>This document updates RFC 7401 and obsoletes RFC 6253.</t></abstract>
