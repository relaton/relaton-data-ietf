<abstract><t>RFC 3177 argued that in IPv6, end sites should be assigned /48 blocks in most cases. The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) adopted that recommendation in 2002, but began reconsidering the policy in 2005. This document revisits and updates the RFC 3177 recommendations on the assignment of IPv6 address space to end sites.  The exact choice of how much address space to assign end sites is a policy issue under the purview of the RIRs, subject to IPv6 architectural and operational considerations. This document reviews the architectural and operational considerations of end site assignments as well as the motivations behind the original 3177 recommendations. The document clarifies that changing the /48 recommendation is one of policy, and has minimal impact on the IPv6 architecture and on IETF Standards.  This document updates and replaces RFC 3177.</t></abstract>
