<abstract><t>Netlmm WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6 enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without changing the IP address.  PMIPv6 also provides limited multi- homing support to multi-mode mobile devices.  Recently Netext WG is being chartered to work on optimizations for PMIPv6.  While multi- homing item has been proposed to be part of the approved charter, discussions showed there are still many controversial issues to be addressed (i.e. the no-host modification theorem).  This document, leveraging parallel activities in the MIF WG, explores solutions for the multi-homing use case aiming at helping Netext community where possible.</t></abstract>
