<abstract><t>The intend of this memo is to set up an IANA registry that collects best current practices in terms of reporting IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) measurements for composition, to users and to end-users. It proposes default values for well known usages and focuses on the identification of the information that should be reported to increase interoperabilty between standard metrics measurements and to facilitate the exchange of measurements results through measurement applications.</t></abstract>
