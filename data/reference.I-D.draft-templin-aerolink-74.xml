<abstract><t>This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual links using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached to AERO links can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers that provide forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and redirection services for route optimization.  AERO provides an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links IPv6 ND to IP forwarding. Admission control and address/prefix provisioning are supported by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), while mobility management and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates.  Although DHCPv6 and IPv6 ND messaging are used in the control plane, both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported in the data plane.  AERO is a widely-applicable tunneling solution especially well suited to mobile Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and other applications as described in this document.</t></abstract>
