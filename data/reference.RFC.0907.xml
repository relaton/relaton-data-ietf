<abstract><t>This document specifies the Host Access Protocol (HAP).  Although HAP    was originally designed as the network-access level protocol for the    DARPA/DCA sponsored Wideband Packet Satellite Network, it is intended    that it evolve into a standard interface SATNET and TACNET (aka MATNET)    as well as the Wideband Network.  HAP is an experimental protocol, and    will undergo further revision as new capabilities are added and/or    different satellite networks are suported.  Implementations of HAP    should be performed in coordination with satellite network development    and operations personnel.</t></abstract>
