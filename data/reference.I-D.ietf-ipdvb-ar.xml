<abstract><t>This document describes the process of binding/associating IPv4/IPv6 addresses with MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). This procedure is known as Address Resolution (AR), or Neighbour Discovery (ND). Such address resolution complements the higher layer resource discovery tools that are used to advertise IP sessions. In MPEG-2 Networks, an IP address must be associated with a Packet ID (PID) value and a specific Transmission Multiplex. The document reviews current methods appropriate to a range of technologies (DVB, ATSC, DOCSIS, and variants). It also describes the interaction with well-known protocols for address management including DHCP, ARP, and the ND protocol, and provides guidance on usage.</t></abstract>
