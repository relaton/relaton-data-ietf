<abstract><t>The Delay-Tolerant-Networking Bundle Protocol includes a custody transfer mechanism to provide acknowledgements of receipt for particular bundles. No checksum is included in the basic DTN Bundle Protocol, however, so it is not possible to verify that bundles have been either forwarded or passed through various convergence layers without errors having been introduced. This document partially rectifies the situation by defining a Bundle Protocol extension for carrying payload checksums and describes how its use can be integrated with both custody transfer and fragmentation.</t></abstract>
