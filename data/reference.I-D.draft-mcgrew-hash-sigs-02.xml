<abstract><t>This note describes a digital signature system based on cryptographic hash functions, following the seminal work in this area.  It specifies a one-time signature scheme based on the work of Lamport, Diffie, Winternitz, and Merkle (LDWM), and a general signature scheme, Merkle Tree Signatures (MTS).  These systems provide asymmetric authentication without using large integer mathematics and can achieve a high security level.  They are suitable for compact implementations, are relatively simple to implement, and naturally resist side-channel attacks.  Unlike most other signature systems, hash-based signatures would still be secure even if it proves feasible for an attacker to build a quantum computer.</t></abstract>
