<abstract><t>In a multi-prefix environment, nodes could have multiple addresses on one network interface.  RFC 3484 defines a source and destination address-selection algorithm, which is commonly deployed in current popular OSs.  However, nodes could encounter some difficulties in network communication when they use default address selection rules defined in RFC 3484.  Some mechanisms for solving address-selection problems are proposed including the RFC 3484 policy table distribution and ICMP error-based mechanisms.  This document describes requirements for these address-selection mechanisms.</t></abstract>
