<abstract><t>This document outlines the problems for the Source Address Verification Architecture (SAVA) initiative to solve. It examines the current state in the internet, looks at current best practices and discusses why the current approach is unlikely to ever solve the problem of IP address spoofing. It also discusses some of the problems that SAVA should NOT attempt to solve.</t></abstract>
