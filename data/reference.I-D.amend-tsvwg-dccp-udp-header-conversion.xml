<abstract><t>The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport-layer protocol that provides upper layers with the ability to use non- reliable congestion-controlled flows.  DCCP is not widely deployed in the Internet, and the reason for that can be defined as a typical example of a chicken-egg problem.  Even if an application developer decided to use DCCP, the middle-boxes like firewalls and NATs would prevent DCCP end-to-end since they lack support for DCCP.  Moreover, as long as the protocol penetration of DCCP does not increase, the middle-boxes will not handle DCCP properly.  To overcome this challenge, NAT/NATP traversal and UDP encapsulation for DCCP is already defined.  However, the former requires special middle-box support and the latter introduces overhead.  The recent proposal of a multipath extension for DCCP further underlines the challenge of efficient middle-box passing as its main goal is to be applied over the Internet, traversing numerous uncontrolled middle-boxes.  This document introduces a new solution which disguises DCCP during transmission as UDP without requiring middle-box modification or introducing any overhead.</t></abstract>
