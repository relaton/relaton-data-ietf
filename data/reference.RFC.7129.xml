<abstract><t>Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that a certain domain name does not exist.  It is also used to signal that a domain name exists but does not have the specific resource record (RR) type you were asking for.  When returning a negative DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) response, a name server usually includes up to two NSEC records.  With NSEC version 3 (NSEC3), this amount is three.</t><t>This document provides additional background commentary and some context for the NSEC and NSEC3 mechanisms used by DNSSEC to provide authenticated denial-of-existence responses.</t></abstract>
