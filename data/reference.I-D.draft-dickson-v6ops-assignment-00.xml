<abstract><t>This Internet Draft describes, analyzes, and compares different strategies for allocating addresses, in a way that can be generalized for any power-of-two sized, binary address space.  One such strategy is proposed as being "optimal", when viewed from the perspective of space-packing efficiency.  This Draft recommends use of this technique as a "Best Current Practice", for both IPv4 and IPv6 address allocations.Author's Note  This Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related draft(s) being placed on the Informational Track for v6ops.</t></abstract>
