<abstract><t>This draft not only describes the management model which is universal to all PSN types supported by PWE3 architecture, but olso defines an experimental part of MIB on Internet community network management protocol,The MIB supports MPLS-TE PSN, non TE MPLS PSN (external layer tunnel created by LDP or by hand) and MPLS PW labels. Particularly , the draft describes the managed objects of L2VPN service on MPLS switching network, including VPLS and VPWS services. Different from PW MIB, the MIB provides the management models for L2VPN service based on MPLS signaling, including the management models of L2VPN service instance, PW, interface and traffic statistics. The MIB supports MPLS PW labels, MPLS-TE PSN, MPLS PSN, VPLS and VPWS services.</t></abstract>
