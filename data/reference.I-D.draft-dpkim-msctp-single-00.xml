<abstract><t>SCTP can be used to support soft IP handover between heterogeneous wireless networks with the help of the ADDIP extension and its multi- homing feature. In this document, we describe the issues in SCTP handover between homogeneous wireless networks for a single-homed host that may cause the serious communication delay. Then, we propose the use of the ASCONF chunk with the cumulative ASCONF Parameters for Add IP Set Primary and Delete IP ASCONF Parameter to support faster IP handover for a single-homed host.</t></abstract>
