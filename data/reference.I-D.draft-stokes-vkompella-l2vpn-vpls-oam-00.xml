<abstract><t>This document describes a methodology and a set of mechanisms for Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) of a general VPN (Virtual Private Network) service, that is applied here to a Virtual Private LAN Service [RFC4761][RFC4762]. [L2VPN-CFM] describes the capabilities of CFM [802.1ag] and VCCV [VCCV] for OAM operations among the bridge module components in the VPLS. The OAM functions described in this document builds the additional capabilities into VPLS OAM to detect, verify and isolate connectivity faults among the VPLS forwarder components. The methodology adopted extends LSP Ping concepts described in [RFC4379] and VCCV capabilities described in [VCCV].</t></abstract>
