<abstract><t>RANGER examines recursive arrangements of enterprise networks, where the term "enterprise" can apply to a very broad set of use case scenarios.  RANGER considers the global Internet itself as the highest level of enterprise network recursion, and assumes that existing policies and operational practices in the current Internet BGP routing system will continue into the foreseeable future. However, RANGER also seeks to arrest the growth of the BGP RIB so that it will level off and not continue to expand along super-linear rates.  In particular, RANGER expects that the current Internet BGP routing system will continue to maintain the current RLOC-based RIB, but that future growth due to mobility, multihoming and PI addressing will be increasingly accommodated using EID addressing instead of RLOC addressing.  This new growth must be accommodated within acceptable scaling limitations for both the RIB and FIB sizes for EID-based routers in the Internet.  Therefore, RANGER proposes that an Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) be established over the existing DFZ for the purpose of supporting scalable EID space routing.</t></abstract>
