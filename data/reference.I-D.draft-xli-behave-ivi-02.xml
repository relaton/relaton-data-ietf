<abstract><t>This document presents the CERNET IVI translation design and deployment for the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence and transition.  The IV stands for 4 and VI stands for 6, so IVI stands for the IPv4/IPv6 translation.  The IVI is a prefix-specific and stateless address mapping mechanism for "an IPv6 network connected to the IPv4 Internet" scenario.  In the IVI design, subsets of the ISP's IPv4 addresses are embedded in ISP's IPv6 addresses and these IPv6 addresses can therefore communicate with the global IPv6 networks directly and can communicate with the global IPv4 networks via stateless translators, which can either be IPv6 initiated or IPv4 initiated.  The IVI mechanism supports the end-to-end address transparency and incremental deployment.  This document is a comprehensive report on the CERNET IVI design and its deployment in large scale public networks.</t></abstract>
