<abstract><t>Unicode's design goal is to be the universal character set for all applications.  The goal entails the inclusion of very large numbers of characters.  It is also focused on written language; special provisions have always been needed for identifiers.  The sheer size of the repertoire increases the possibility of accidental or intentional use of characters that can cause confusion among users, particularly where linguistic context is ambiguous, unavailable, or impossible to determine.  A registry of code points that can be sometimes especially problematic may be useful to guide system administrators in setting parameters for allowable code points in an identifier system, and to aid applications in creating security aids for users.</t></abstract>
