<abstract><t>This document defines two namespaces of URNs, based on using a timestamp with an (encoded) URI.  The results are namespaces in which names are readily assigned, offer the persistence of reference that is required by URNs, but do not require a stable authority to assign the name.  The first namespace ("duri") is used to refer to URI- identified resources as they appeared at a particular time.  The second namespace ("tdb") is useful as a way of creating URNs that refer to physical objects or even abstractions that are not themselves networked resources.  The definition of these namespaces may reduce the need to define new URN namespaces merely for the purpose of creating stable identifiers. In addition, they provide a ready means for identifying "non- information resources" by semantic indirection.  Note  This document is not a product of any working group.  Many of the ideas here have been discussed since 2001.  This document has been discussed on the mailing list &lt;uri@w3.org>.</t></abstract>
