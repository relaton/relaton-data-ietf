<abstract><t>This document describes a solution called AUTO-BFD, that automatically initiates BFD sessions for BGP next-hops.  This makes it possible to avoid blackholing scenarios when a BGP peer is not the BGP next-hop, especially on Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) when BGP Route-Servers are deployed.  When they are configured with this mechanism, routers can automatically try to establish a new adjacency for every new BGP next-hop.  BGP routes are then checked against the state of the BFD session for the corresponding next-hop.  Foreword  A placeholder to list general observations about this document.</t></abstract>
