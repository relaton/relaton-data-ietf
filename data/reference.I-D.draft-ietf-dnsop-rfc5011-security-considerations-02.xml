<abstract><t>This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing advice that must be followed in order to maintain security. Specifically, this document describes the math behind the minimum time-length that a DNS zone publisher must wait before signing with only recently added DNSKEYs.  This document also describes the minimum time-length that a DNS zone publisher must wait after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming that all active RFC5011 resolvers should have seen the revocation-marked key and removed it from their list of trust anchors.</t></abstract>
