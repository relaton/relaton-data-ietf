<abstract><t>Email has become a popular distribution service for a variety of socially unacceptable, mass-effect purposes. The most obvious ones include spam and worms. This note recommends conventions for the operation of email submission and transport services between independent operators, such as enterprises and Internet Service Providers. Its goal is to improve lines of accountability for controlling abusive uses of the Internet mail service. Consequently the document offers recommendations for constructive operational policies between independent operators of email transmission services. With the recent advent of email authentication technologies aimed at providing assurances and traceability between internetworked networks, the authors recognized that the initial submission of a message became the weakest link. Consequently, the document offers recommendations for constructive operational policies for the first step of email sending, the submission (or posting) of email into the transmission network. Relaying and delivery entail policies that occur subsequent to submission and are outside the scope of this document. The document seeks BCP status. Comments and discussion of this document should be addressed to the ietf-smtp@imc.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
