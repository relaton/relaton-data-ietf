<abstract><t>This document describes methodologies that have been designed to improve and facilitate IETF document flow processing. It specifies a set of procedures under which a working group chair or secretary serves as the primary Document Shepherd for a document that has been submitted to the IESG for publication. Before this, the shepherding role has traditionally been filled by the Area Director responsible for the working group.</t></abstract>
