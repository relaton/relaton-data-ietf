<abstract><t>This document provides an overview of the draft requirements for IPv6 support in the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications. Our goal is to share high-level IPv6 requirements and design architecture in draft status with the IETF community. We first introduce the main network elements involved in the support of IPv6 in DOCSIS cable networks and expand on the deployment scenarios in scope of the DOCSIS 3.0 efforts. We elaborate on the roles played by some network elements in enabling IPv6 in DOCSIS: the broadband access device (Cable Modem), the headend or network side equipment (Cable Modem Termination System) and the various backoffice servers. Some high-level requirements are then summarized with a special focus on three network services: IPv6 provisioning and management of cable modems, IPv6 transport via a DOCSIS network using a cable modem acting as an IPv6 bridge or router, and IP multicast. Finally, we conclude with a theory of operations section to provide more details and sample flows on how an IPv6-capable cable modem acquires its IPv6 address and configuration parameters over a DOCSIS 3.0 network. CableLabs, its members, the vendors participating in the DOCSIS specifications and the co-authors of this document are seeking general feedback from the IETF community on the overall DOCSIS IPv6 approach. The level of requirements provided in this document may vary; we also welcome feedback on where more details should be provided in future versions.</t></abstract>
