<abstract><t>This document describes a simple extension of the URI format to allow preferred transport mechanisms and interfaces to be specified.  This explicit configuration is beneficial for separation of HTTP from underlying transports, which has been increasingly recognised as useful.  Explicit configuration in the URI for programs is valuable when TCP, traditionally used to carry HTTP, is not present or not desired, or when other methods of determining or negotiating the appropriate transport method to use, e.g. the Domain Name System (DNS), are absent.</t></abstract>
