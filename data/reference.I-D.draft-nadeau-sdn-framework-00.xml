<abstract><t>This document presents a framework for Software Defined Networks (SDN).  The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture of the problem space of SDN and to describe the relationships among the various components necessary to manipulate the components that comprise SDNs.  SDN requires the specification of several key components including an "orchestrator" and various "plug-ins" between the orchestrator function and network resources. In addition to this, an orchestrator will require interconnection with standard policy bases, as well as other orchestrators in distributed environments or insofar as to support high-availability and fault-tolerance capabilities. To this end, several interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as enabling the orchestrator to manipulate and interact with the control planes of devices such as routers and switches, as well as a discourse between different orchestrators will be described.  The intent of this document is to outline what each interface needs to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed specification to other documents.</t></abstract>
