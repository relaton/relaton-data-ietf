<abstract><t>The MPLS and GMPLS protocol suites have become quite popular for a growing number of applications and deployment scenarios. One result of this popularity is a large number of suggestions for modifications and extensions. The IETF needs to be flexible and responsive in how it handles these suggestions, and has a responsibility to supervise the growth and evolution of MPLS and GMPLS protocols. This memo describes the process through which individuals, working groups and external standards bodies can influence the development of the MPLS and GMPLS standards. This process means that extensions and changes to protocols specified by these working groups can only be made through the IETF, the body that created the (G)MPLS ((Generalized) Multiprotocol Label Switching) technologies. When possible, existing liaison relationships are used.</t></abstract>
