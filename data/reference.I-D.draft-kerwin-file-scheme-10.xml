<abstract><t>This document specifies the file Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme that was originally specified in RFC 1738.  The purpose of this document is to keep the information about the scheme on standards track, since RFC 1738 has been made obsolete, and to promote interoperability by addressing disagreements between various implementations.  Note to Readers  This draft should be discussed on its github project page [github].</t></abstract>
