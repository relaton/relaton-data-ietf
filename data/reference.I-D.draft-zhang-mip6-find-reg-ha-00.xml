<abstract><t>In mobile IPv6 networks, a mobile node must register its new care of address with its home agent after changing its attachment point, so that it can maintain connectivity with peers. In the deployment of MIPv6, there may be multiple home agents for load balancing and/or reliability. In the case of load balancing, some mobile nodes may register their care of addresses with one home agent, and other mobile nodes may register their care of addresses with other home agents. Some applications may need to query the MIPv6 service status of a mobile node from home agents, such as the care of address, the life time of binding, or other information associated with mobile node that is stored on home agents. In order to satisfy this requirement, the first step is to locate which home agent the mobile node belongs to, that is to say to confirm which home agent to query. This document describes a protocol which can be used to locate the home agent that a mobile node belongs to.</t></abstract>
