<abstract><t>This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent Web IDentifiers for web material in web archives using the 'pwid' namespace identifier.  The main purpose of the standard is to support specification of references that are not covered by other reference techniques: to support references to material in web archives with restricted access.  Furthermore, it supports persistent technology agnostic references to web archives in general, in a form that can work as an algorithmic basis for finding web archive resources in general.  An additional important benefit is that the standard can be used for specifying web collections, which can then form a persistent computational basis for the extract of the archived collection parts. Since these parts can be specified generally, this further allows collections to be specified with elements from one or more web archives.  The PWID URN is designed to meet requirements for proper referencing needed by researchers.  Therefore, it is designed as general, global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic, persistent and precise web references for web materials in web archives.</t></abstract>
