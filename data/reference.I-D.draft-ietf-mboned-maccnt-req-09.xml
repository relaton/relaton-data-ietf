<abstract><t>This memo presents requirements in the area of accounting and access control for IP multicasting.  The scope of the requirements is limited to cases where Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) functions are coordinated between Content Provider(s) and Network Service Provider(s).  In order to describe the new requirements of a multi-entity Content Delivery Service(CDS) using multicast, the memo presents three basic business models: 1) the Content Provider and the Network Provider are the same entity, 2) the Content Provider(s) and the Network Provider(s) are separate entities and users are not directly billed, and 3) the Content Provider(s) and the Network Provider(s) are separate entities and users are billed based on content consumption or subscriptions.  The requirements of these three models are listed and evaluated as to which aspects are already supported by existing technologies and which aspects are not.  General requirements for accounting and admission control capabilities including quality-of-service (QoS) related issues are listed and the constituent logical functional components are presented.  This memo assumes that the capabilities can be realized by integrating AAA functionalities with a multicast CDS system, with IGMP/MLD at the edge of the network.</t></abstract>
