<abstract><t>This document specifies a framework for using existing, modified and potential new networking technologies as components to provide an Enhanced Virtual Private Networks (VPN+) service.  The purpose is to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services by utilizing an approach that is based on existing VPN technologies and adds features that specific services require over and above traditional VPNs.  Typically, VPN+ will be used to form the underpinning of network slicing, but could also be of use in its own right.  It is not envisaged that large numbers of VPN+ instances will be deployed in a network and, in particular, it is not intended that all VPNs supported by a network will use VPN+ techniques.</t></abstract>
