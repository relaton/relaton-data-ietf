<abstract><t>The purpose of the INFO request for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), as described by RFC 2976, is to provide mid-session SIP User Agent (UA)-to-SIP UA application data transport. In the years since the introduction of the INFO request, experience with the use of the INFO request indicates a number of problems. This document explains why there are INFO-based, proprietary protocols in the wild; the flaws of using INFO; and explains why it is not possible to create a framework to rescue INFO for general purpose use. Thus, this document restricts the use of INFO to call establishment signaling, as described in RFC 3372 (SIP-T).</t></abstract>
