<abstract><t>Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's communications or activities.  Surveillance is one of several privacy /security threats engineers try to take into account in their designs.  The reports about pervasive monitoring of Internet traffic have, however, surprised many since the scale was not envisaged during the design of many Internet protocols even though the ambition to offer end-to-end security on the Internet dates back even to the 70ies.  The approach to get access to meta-data as well as to communication content has taken forms that are largely indistinguishable from ordinary attacks.  This document explains the attacks in context of the larger Internet eco-system.</t></abstract>
