<abstract><t>This document describes Mutual OATH, a mechanism for mutual authentication based on the HOTP algorithm [RFC4226] introduced by OATH (initiative for Open AuTHentication) [OATH] and submitted as an individual draft to the IETF last year. The security and strength of Mutual OATH depends on the properties of the underlying building block HOTP, which is a construction based on HMAC [RFC2104] using SHA-1 as the hash function.</t></abstract>
