<abstract><t>This document aims to explain the requirement and usecases for reducing reliability gaps in first point of contact during secure authentication of nodes without the need of any CA. It focuses on use of network layer security approaches for this purpose. Privacy requirement is also one of the important topic that will be addressed in this draft. It also discusses the requirements and use cases for having a common language (protocols) for authentication/authorization in visualization environments where Software Defined Network (SDN) or Network Function Visualization (NFV) approaches are in use.</t></abstract>
