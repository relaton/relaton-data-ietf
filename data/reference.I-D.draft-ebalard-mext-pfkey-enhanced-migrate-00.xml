<abstract><t>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and show how the two protocols can interwork.  An extension of the PF_KEY framework is proposed which allows smooth and solid operation of IKE in a Mobile IPv6 environment.  This document is heavily based on a previous draft [MIGRATE] written by Shinta Sugimoto, Masahide Nakamura and Francis Dupont.  It simply reuses the MIGRATE mechanism defined in the expired document, removes a companion extension (SADB_X_EXT_PACKET) based on implementation feedback (complexity, limitations, ...) and fills the gap by very simple changes to MIGRATE mechanism.  This results in a more simple and consistent mechanism, which also proved to be easier to implement.  This document is expected to serve as a continuation of [MIGRATE] work.  For that reason, the name of the extension has been kept.  PF_KEY MIGRATE message serves as a carrier for updated address information for both the in-kernel IPsec structures (SP/SA) and those maintained by the key managers.  This includes in-kernel SP/SA endpoints, key manager maintained equivalents and addresses used by IKE_SA (current and to be negotiated).  The extension is helpful for assuring smooth internetworking between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE for the bootstrapping of mobile nodes and their movements.</t></abstract>
