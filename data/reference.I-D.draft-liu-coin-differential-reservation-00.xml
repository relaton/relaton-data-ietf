<abstract><t>Computing in the network may require the embedded computing capability in the network device, such as gateway, switch, etc, and there might be so much distributed computing task in the network. Some new applications like AR/VR, motion control put forward higher demand of network than before, and AI is also considered to be used in the app and network.  In order to satisfy their demands, network may not only need to reserve bandwidth resource, but also reserve computing resource. This document analyzes the requirements of Serial distributed computing model and give some reference solutions.</t></abstract>
