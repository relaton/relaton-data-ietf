<abstract><t>A way to solve the issue of site multihoming is to have a separate site prefix for each connection of the site, and to derive as many addresses for each hosts. This approach to multi-homing, which we call Host-Centric IPv6 Multihoming, has the advantage of minimal impact on the inter-domain routing fabric, since each site prefix can be aggregated within the larger prefix of a specific provider; however, it opens a number of issues, which we will discuss in this memo, including the problem created by the interaction between ingress filtering and multihoming, which we analyze in detail. We then propose a set of specific solutions that enable host centric multihoming, and we review how these solutions meet the requirements of IPv6 site multihoming.</t></abstract>
