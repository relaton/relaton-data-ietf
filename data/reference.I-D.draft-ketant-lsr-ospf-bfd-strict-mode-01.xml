<abstract><t>This document specifies the extensions to OSPF that enables a router and its neighbor to signal their intention to use Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for their adjacency using link-local advertisement between them.  The signaling of this BFD enablement, allows the router to block and not allow the establishment of adjacency with its neighbor router until a BFD session is successfully established between them.  The document describes this "strict-mode" of BFD establishment as a prerequisite to OSPF adjacency formation.</t></abstract>
