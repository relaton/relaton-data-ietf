In this draft, mid-control commands, for example, retrieving server images or saving images in the server are defined and delivered as session names of INVITE messages. IN addition to that, INFO definitions specific to the application are described. For example, camera control like PTZ(Pen, Tilt, Zoom) information is defined for the purpose of standardization of controls.</t></abstract>
