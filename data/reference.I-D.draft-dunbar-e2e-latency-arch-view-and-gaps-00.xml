<abstract><t>Ultra-Low Latency is a highly desired property for many types of services, such as 5G MTC (Machine Type Communication) requiring E2E connection for V2V to be less than 2ms, AR/VR requiring delay less than 5ms, V2X less than 20ms, etc.  This draft examines the E2E latency from architectural perspective, from studying how different OSI layers contribute to E2E latency, how different domains, which can be different operators' domains or administrative domains, contribute to E2E latency, to analyzing the gaps of recent technology advancement in reducing latency.  By studying the contributing factors to E2E latency from various angles, the draft identifies some gaps of recent technology advancement for E2E services traversing multiple domains and involving multiple layers, which can be the basis for IAB to organize more in-depth discussion, like workshop or cross Area (or industry wide) BOF, as the scope of the discussion will be too wide for one IETF WG. The discussion might touch upon multiple IETF areas.  The goal of those further "deep-dive" workshop or cross area BOF is to establish more comprehensive foundation to IESG and the IETF community in identifying potential new work initiatives for reducing E2E latency of services over the Internet.</t></abstract>
