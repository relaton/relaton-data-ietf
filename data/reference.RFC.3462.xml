<abstract><t>The Multipart/Report Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) content-type is a general &quot;family&quot; or &quot;container&quot; type for electronic mail reports of any kind.  Although this memo defines only the use of the Multipart/Report content-type with respect to delivery status reports, mail processing programs will benefit if a single content-type is used to for all kinds of reports. This document is part of a four document set describing the delivery status report service.  This collection includes the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) extensions to request delivery status reports, a MIME content for the reporting of delivery reports, an enumeration of extended status codes, and a multipart container for the delivery report, the original message, and a human-friendly summary of the failure.
