<abstract><t>Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents are widely used as containers for the exchange and storage of arbitrary data in today's systems. Updates to this data require transporting of the entire XML document between hosts, unless there's a mechanism that allows exchanging only the updates of XML documents. This document describes an XML patch framework utilizing XML Path language (XPath) selectors. These selector values and updated new data content constitute the basis of patch operations described in this document. In addition to them, with basic &lt;add>, &lt;replace> and &lt;remove> directives a set of patches can then be applied to update an existing XML document.</t></abstract>
