<abstract><t>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), a peer-to-peer (P2P) binary signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract hash table service between a set of cooperating peers that form the overlay network.  RELOAD is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements by defining new usages that specify the data kinds that must be stored for a particular application.  RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides unique identities.  NAT traversal is a fundamental service of the protocol.  RELOAD also allows access from "client" nodes which do not need to route traffic or store data for others.</t></abstract>
