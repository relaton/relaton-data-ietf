<abstract><t>In [I-D.ietf-grow-route-leak-problem-definition], the authors have provided a definition of the route leak problem, and also enumerated several types of route leaks.  In this document, we first examine which of those route-leak types are detected and mitigated by the existing origin validation (OV) [RFC 6811].  It is recognized that OV offers a limited detection and mitigation capability against route leaks.  This document proposes an enhancement that significantly extends the route-leak detection and mitigation capabilities of BGP. The solution involves carrying a per-hop route-leak protection (RLP) field in BGP updates.  The RLP field is proposed be carried in an optional transitive path attribute.  The solution is meant to be initially implemented as an enhancement of BGP without requiring BGPsec [I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol].  However, when BGPsec is deployed in the future, the solution can be incorporated in BGPsec, enabling cryptographic protection for the RLP field.  That would be one way of implementing the proposed solution in a secure way.  It is not claimed that the solution detects all possible types of route leaks but it detects several types, especially considering some significant route-leak occurrences that have been observed in recent years.  The document also includes a stopgap method for detection and mitigation of route leaks for an intermediate phase when OV is deployed but BGP protocol on the wire is unchanged.</t></abstract>
