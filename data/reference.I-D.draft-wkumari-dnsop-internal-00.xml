<abstract><t>It has become clear that many users would like to use the DNS resolution system for names which do not have meaning in the global context but do have meaning in a context internal to their network. This document reserves the string ".internal" for this purpose.  [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings, etc.  They will be removed before publication.  RFC Editor: Please remove these before publication. ]  [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-internal.  The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]  [ Ed note: This document is intended to drive discussion.  It is clear that there has been a desire for an "RFC 1918-style" TLD for a long time; in its absence, people have just started using whatever seemed convenient.  This document requests that the allocation of .internal for this use.  There is no existing process for this - some of the purpose of this document is to explore the process implications. ]</t></abstract>
