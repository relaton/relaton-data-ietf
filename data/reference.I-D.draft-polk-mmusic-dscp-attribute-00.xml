<abstract><t>The offer/answer model for SDP currently is without a mechanism for the configuration of the Differentiated Services Codepoint to use for the media streams endpoints establish. Endpoints in more controlled environments, typically bounded within a domain, require intermediary servers to notify them what specific DSCP, lending itself to a PHB, a media stream should be set to, as granular as at the media stream level when more than one stream is in a session description, or changed to, based on dynamic network conditions.</t></abstract>
