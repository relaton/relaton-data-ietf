<abstract><t>National Bibliography Numbers, NBNs, are widely used by the national libraries and other organizations in order to identify various resources such as digitized monographs.  Generally, NBNs may be applied to all kinds of resources that do not have an established (standard) identifier system of their own.  A URN (Uniform Resource Names) namespace for NBNs was established in 2001 in RFC 3188.  Since then, several national libraries in several European countries have implemented URN:NBN-based systems.  This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be supported within the updated URN framework.  A revised namespace registration (version 4) is included.</t></abstract>
