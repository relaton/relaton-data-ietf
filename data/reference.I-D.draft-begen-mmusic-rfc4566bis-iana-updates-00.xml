<abstract><t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) specification is currently being revised.  There are a number of issues that have been identified in the IANA registries related to the SDP protocol (These are tracked in the issue tracker).  This document has the goal of addressing these issues by making the necessary changes in the IANA registries and registration procedures.  The changes and updates listed in this draft are submitted in this individual draft rather than the 4566bis draft because (i) the 4566bis draft has seen quite a number of changes recently, which require a detailed review and further revisions would make the review process difficult, and (ii) the changes and updates listed in this draft are all IANA related matters.  If this draft gets published separately, it will update RFC 4566 or the RFC resulting from the 4566bis draft.  An alternative option is to include the whole text in the 4566bis draft once the changes and updates are agreed.</t></abstract>
