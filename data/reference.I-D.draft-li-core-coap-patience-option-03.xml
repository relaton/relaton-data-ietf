<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP, the Patience option.  This option informs a recipient of the preferred time frame for a request or response depending on usage context.  In a unicast request, it indicates the patience a client has in waiting for a response.  The CoAP server tries to return the response within the specified time frame.  In a multicast request, it indicates the patience a server should have in sending its response. The recipient would then try to randomly delay its response within the time frame that the requester indicated or computed by the recipient itself.  In a CoAP observe notification, it indicates the patience an observer should have in both waiting for a subsequent notification and in re-establishing an observation relation.</t></abstract>
