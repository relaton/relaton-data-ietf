<abstract><t>Repair path mechanism is an important element in IP/LDP fast reroute. In this document we propose a way to calculate local repair paths using alternative shortest paths. The solution can provide complete coverage for all destinations within an IGP area that can possibly be protected. In this document we also suggested an "Explicit Path with Loose Segment" model that can be used to characterize, classify, and analyse repair paths. We proved some of the common properties of loose segments, and showed that the model can be used to characterize all existing fast reroute solutions.</t></abstract>
