<abstract><t>While IKEv2 supports public key based authentication (PKI), the corresponding use of in-band CRLs is problematic due to unbounded CRL size. The size of an OCSP response is however well-bounded and small. This document defines two extensions to IKEv2 which enable the use of OCSP for in-band signaling of certificate revocation status. Two new content encodings are defined for use in the CERTREQ and CERT payloads: OCSP Responder Hash and OCSP Response. An OCSP Responder Hash CERTREQ payload triggers transmission of an OCSP Response CERT payload. When certificates are used with IKEv2, the communicating peers need a mechanism to determine the revocation status of the peer's certificate. OCSP is one such mechanism. This document applies when OCSP is desired and security policy prevents one of the IKEv2 peers from accessing the relevant OCSP responder directly. Firewalls are often deployed in a manner that prevents such access by IKEv2 peers outside of an enterprise network.</t></abstract>
