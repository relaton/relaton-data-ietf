<abstract><t>In customer sites having IPv4-only CPEs, Teredo provides a last resort IPv6 connectivity [RFC4380] [RFC5991] [RFC6081].  However, because it is designed to work without involvement of Internet service providers, it has significant limitations (connectivity between IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is uncertain; connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations of NAT types). 6a44 is a complementary solution that, being base on ISP cooperation, avoids these limitations.  At the beginning of IPv6 addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix by network specific /48 prefixes assigned by local ISP's (an evolution similar to that from 6to4 to 6rd).  The specification is complete enough for actual deployment, including with independently written codes.</t></abstract>
