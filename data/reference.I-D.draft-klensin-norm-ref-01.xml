<abstract><t>The IETF and RFC Editor have a long-standing rule that a document at a given maturity level cannot be published until all documents it references as normative are at that maturity level or higher. This rule has sometimes resulted in very long publication delays for documents and some claims that it was a major obstruction to advancing documents in maturity level. The IETF agreed to a way to bypass this rule with RFC 3967. This document proposes a one-year process experiment in which the "hold on normative reference" rule will be replaced by a "note downward normative reference and move on" approach.</t></abstract>
