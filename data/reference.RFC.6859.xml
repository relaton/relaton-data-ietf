<abstract><t>RFC 3777 specifies that &quot;sitting members&quot; of the IAB and IESG &quot;may                not volunteer to serve on the nominating committee&quot;.  Since the time that document was written, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) was formed; that body is not covered by RFC 3777. There is also ambiguity in RFC 3777 about whether ex officio members and liaisons are included as &quot;sitting members&quot;.  This document updates RFC 3777 to clarify the rules as they apply to members of the IAB, the IESG, and the IAOC.  This memo documents an Internet Best  Current Practice.</t></abstract>
