<abstract><t>The proxy server plays a central role as an intermediary in the establishment of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In that role, they can define and impact policies on call routing, rendezvous, and other call features. However, there is no standard means by which proxies can have any influence on session policies, such as the codecs that are to be used. As such, ad-hoc and non-conformant techniques have been deployed to allow for such policy mechanisms. There is a need for a standards-based and complete mechanism for session policies. This document defines a set of requirements for such a mechanism.</t></abstract>
