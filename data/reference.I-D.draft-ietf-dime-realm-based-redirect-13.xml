<abstract><t>The Diameter protocol includes a capability for message redirection, controlled by an application-independent "redirect agent".  In some circumstances, an operator may wish to redirect messages to an alternate domain without specifying individual hosts.  This document specifies an application-specific mechanism by which a Diameter server or proxy (node) can perform such a redirection when S-NAPTR is not used for dynamic peer discovery.  A node performing this new function is referred to as a "Realm-based Redirect Server".  This memo updates Sections 6.13 and 6.14 of RFC6733 with respect to the usage of the Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs.</t></abstract>
