<abstract><t>This memo describes extended uses for payload header in "RTP Payload Format for JPEG 2000 Video Streams" as specified in RFC XXXY.  For better support of JPEG 2000 features such as scalability and main header recovery.  This memo must be accompanied with a complete implementation of "RTP Payload Format for JPEG 2000 Video Streams."  That document is a complete description of the payload header and signaling, this document only describes additional processing for the payload header. There is an additional media type and SDP marker signaling for implementations of this document.  -- RFC-Editor Note: The authors ask the RFC Editors to replace all instances of RFC XXXY with the RFC number assigned when draft-ietf-avt-rtp-jpeg2000-20 [JP2RTP] is published as an RFC.  At that time, please remove the note.</t></abstract>
