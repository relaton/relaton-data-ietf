<abstract><t>This document specifies an identity-based security scheme for wireless sensor network (WSN) on the basis of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE). Each cluster head can perform as a private key generator (PKG) in case that the sole PKG is captured, which will lead to the whole network disabled. The proposed scheme can reduce the consumption of key resources and improve the security of the WSN by dispersing PKG function. The analysis shows that the scheme can resist various attacks.</t></abstract>
