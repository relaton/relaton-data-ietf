<abstract><t>The amount of time it takes to establish a session using common transport APIs in dual-stack networks and networks with filtering such as proposed in BCP 38 is a barrier to IPv6 deployment.  This note describes a test that can be used to determine whether an application can reliably establish sessions quickly in a complex environment such as dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6) deployment or IPv6 deployment with multiple prefixes and upstream ingress filtering. This test is not a test of a specific algorithm, but of the external behavior of the system as a black box.  Any algorithm that has the intended external behavior will be accepted by it.  This document is  not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
