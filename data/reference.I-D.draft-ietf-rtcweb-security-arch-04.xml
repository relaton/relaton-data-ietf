<abstract><t>The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) working group is tasked with standardizing protocols for enabling real-time communications within user-agents using web technologies (e.g JavaScript).  The major use cases for RTCWEB technology are real-time audio and/or video calls, Web conferencing, and direct data transfer. Unlike most conventional real-time systems (e.g., SIP-based soft phones) RTCWEB communications are directly controlled by some Web server, which poses new security challenges.  For instance, a Web browser might expose a JavaScript API which allows a server to place a video call.  Unrestricted access to such an API would allow any site which a user visited to "bug" a user's computer, capturing any activity which passed in front of their camera.  [I-D.ietf-rtcweb- security] defines the RTCWEB threat model.  This document defines an architecture which provides security within that threat model.</t></abstract>
