<abstract><t>This document discusses the One Way Latency (OWL) utilization for enhancing multipath TCP (MPTCP) transmission, which is a potential and beneficial technology in MPTCP Working Group (WG). Several representative usages of OWL, such as retransmission policy, crucial data scheduling, are analyzed. Two kinds of OWL measurement approaches are also provided and compared. We believe that more explorations related with OWL will be important for MPTCP.</t></abstract>
