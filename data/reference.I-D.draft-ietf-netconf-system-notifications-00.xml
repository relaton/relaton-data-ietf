<abstract><t>The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration datastores.  However, client applications often need to be aware of common system events such as a change in system capabilities, which may impact management applications.  Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the system events within the NETCONF server.  This document defines a YANG module which allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for some common system events.</t></abstract>
