<abstract><t>The IETF policies about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), such as patent rights, relative to technologies developed in the IETF are designed to ensure that IETF working groups and participants have as much information about any IPR constraints on a technical proposal as possible.  The policies are intended to benefit the Internet community and the public at large, while respecting the legitimate rights of IPR holders.  This memo details the IETF policies concerning IPR related to technology worked on within the IETF.  It also describes the objectives that the policies are designed to meet. This memo updates RFC 2026 and obsoletes RFC 3979 and RFC 4879.</t></abstract>
