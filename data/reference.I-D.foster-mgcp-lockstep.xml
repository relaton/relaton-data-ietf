<abstract><t>A Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) endpoint that has encountered an adverse failure condition such as being involved in a transient call when a Call Agent failover occurred could be left in a lockstep state such that events are quarantined but not notified. The MGCP package described in this document provides a mechanism for reporting these situations so that the new Call Agent can take the necessary fault recovery procedures.</t></abstract>
