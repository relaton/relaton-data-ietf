<abstract><t>This document defines Centrally Allocated IPv6 Unique Local address prefixes.  These prefixes are globally unique and are intended for local communications, usually within a single network administration. They are not intended to be used in place of Provider Independent (PI) address prefixes available from the Regional Internet Registries (RIR) &lt;ref:  http://www.iana.org/numbers/ > , and should not appear in the global routing table for the Internet.  The draft is being discussed on the ipv6@ietf.org list.
