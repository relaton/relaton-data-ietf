<abstract><t>This memorandum describes how the HIP control packets can be used to send requests for preferred certificates to the correspondent hosts. This document specifies a new CERTREQ parameter and describes its use in requesting an issuance of certificates from accepted Certification Authorities (CAs).  This document focuses on the means as to how to request for a certificate, and how to signal an error in case of the desired certificate is not available.  The syntax of certificates and certificate requests is out of scope of this document.</t></abstract>
