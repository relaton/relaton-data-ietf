<abstract><t>Remote access clients, in particular IPsec-based ones, are heavily deployed in enterprise environments.  In many enterprises the security policy allows remote-access clients to switch to unprotected operation when entering the trusted network.  This document specifies a method that lets a client detect this situation in a secure manner, with the help of a security gateway.  We propose a minor extension to IKEv2 to achieve this goal.</t></abstract>
