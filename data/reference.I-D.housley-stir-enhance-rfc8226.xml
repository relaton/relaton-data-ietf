<abstract><t>RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain the JWT claims that can be included in the PASSporT as defined in RFC 8225.  If the signer includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries, then the recipient will reject the entire PASSporT.  This document defines additional ways that the JWT claims can be constrained.</t></abstract>
