<abstract><t>This document specifies requirements for algorithms that make ICE connectivity checks more aggressive to reduce delays in dual stack host connectivity checks when there is a path failure for the address family preferred by the application or by the operating system.  As IPv6 is usually preferred, the procedures in this document helps avoid user-noticable delays wheen the IPv6 path is broken or excessively slow.</t></abstract>
