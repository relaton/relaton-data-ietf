<abstract><t>In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising SPF and Sender-ID, two proposed email authentication protocols. Because of interoperability concerns and the inability of the working group producing them to converge on a single specification, the IESG required them to have Experimental status and invited the community to observe their deployments for a period of time, hoping convergence would be possible later.  After six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been collected that the experiment thus created can be considered concluded, and a common path toward can be selected.  This memo presents those findings.</t></abstract>
