<abstract><t>This memo proposes a solution, based on fractional addresses, to face the IPv4 public address exhaustion.  It details the solution and presents a mock-up implementation, with the results of tests that validate the concept.  It also describes architectures and how fractional addresses are used to overcome the IPv4 address shortage. A comparison with the alternative Carrier-Grade NAT (CG-NAT) solutions is also elaborated in the document.  The IPv6 variant of this solution is described in a companion draft.</t></abstract>
