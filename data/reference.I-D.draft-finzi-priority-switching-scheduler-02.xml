<abstract><t>We detail the implementation of a network scheduler that aims at isolating time constrained and elastic traffic flows from best-effort traffic.  This scheduler inherits from the priority scheduler (PS) but dynamically changes the priority of one or several queues.  Usual implementations of rate scheduler schemes (such as WRR, DRR, ...) do not allow to efficiently guarantee the capacity dedicated to both AF and BE classes as they mostly provide soft bounds.  This means excessive margin is used to ensure the capacity requested and this impacts the number of additional users that could be accepted in the network.  To cope with this issue, this memo presents a credit based scheduler mechanism called Priority Switching Scheduler (PSS) that allows a more predictable output rate per traffic class.</t></abstract>
