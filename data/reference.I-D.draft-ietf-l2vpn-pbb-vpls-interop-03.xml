<abstract><t>The scalability of H-VPLS with Ethernet access network can be improved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality in VPLS access. Provider Backbone Bridging has been standardized as IEEE 802.1ah-2008, and aims to improve the scalability of MAC addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet networks. This document describes different interoperability scenarios where Provider Backbone Bridge functionality is used in H-VPLS with Ethernet or MPLS access network to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses and number of service instances. The document also describes the scenarios and the mechanisms for incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge functionality within H-VPLS with existing Ethernet access and interoperability among them. Furthermore, the document discusses the migration mechanisms and scenarios by which Provider Backbone Bridge functionality can be incorporated into H- VPLS with existing MPLS access.</t></abstract>
