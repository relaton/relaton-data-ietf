<abstract><t>This document provides an analysis of certain inter-working problems between IPv6 nodes running Mobile IPv6, at least one of which is connected to a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specified General Packet Radio Service/Universal Mobile Tele- communications System (GPRS/UMTS) network. The inter-working problems are caused by some specific packet filtering operations at the edge of the GPRS/UMTS network which are applied to control access to the GPRS/UMTS services and network resources. However, we believe that other scenarios may exist in which similar packet filtering operations may be applied and that similar problems would arise in these more general scenarios. The GPRS Gateway Support Node (GGSN) checks the source address or the destination address in the basic IPv6 header of incoming or outgoing IP datagrams against a set of packet filtering information established during the GPRS/UMTS session set-up. The packet filtering information remains stable during the sessions and independent of Mobile IP. When MIPv6 is activated by either end of the IPv6 mobile nodes, the packet filtering will fail to perform properly and subsequently block the traffic due to the mismatch between the packet filters and the current source address or destination address in the basic IPv6 header of the IP datagrams to and from the IPv6 mobile nodes.</t></abstract>
