<abstract><t>Sieve defines an email filtering language that can, in principle, plug into any point in the processing of an email message.  As defined in the base specification, it plugs into mail delivery.  This document defines how Sieve can plug into points in the IMAP protocol where messages are created or changed, adding the option of user- defined or installation-defined filtering (or, with Sieve extensions, features such as notifications).Note  This document defines extensions to IMAP and Sieve.  It is the work of the Sieve Working Group, but had previously been in the lemonade mailing list, as draft-ietf-lemonade-imap-sieve.  1.  Discussion of this document should be taken to the Sieve mailing  list at mailto:sieve@ietf.org  2.  Subscription requests can be sent to  mailto:sieve@ietf.org?body=subscribe (send an email message with  the word "subscribe" in the body).  3.  A WWW archive of back messages is available at  http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/sieve/index.html  4.  Older messages, which were posted to the lemonade mailing list,  are archived at  http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/lemonade/index.html</t></abstract>
