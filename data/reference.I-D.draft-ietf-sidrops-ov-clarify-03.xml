<abstract><t>Deployment of RPKI-based BGP origin validation is hampered by, among other things, vendor mis-implementations in two critical areas: which routes are validated and whether policy is applied when not specified by configuration.  This document is meant to clarify possible misunderstandings causing those mis-implementations; and thus updates RFC6811 by clarifying that all prefixes should be marked, and that policy must not be applied without operator configuration"</t></abstract>
