<abstract><t>This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  Extended from MPLS technologies, MPLS-TP introduces new OAM capabilities, a transport- oriented path protection mechanism, and strong emphasis on static provisioning supported by network management systems.  This document addresses the security aspects that are relevant in the context of MPLS-TP specifically.  It describes the security requirements for MPLS-TP and potential security threats and mitigation procedures for MPLS-TP networks and MPLS-TP inter-connection to MPLS and GMPLS networks.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.  This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF Last Call.  [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC has IETF Consensus.]</t></abstract>
