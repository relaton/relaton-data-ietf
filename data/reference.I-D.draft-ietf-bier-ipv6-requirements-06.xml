<abstract><t>The BIER WG charter includes work on developing "a mechanism to use BIER natively in IPv6".  There have been several proposed solutions in this area.  But there hasn't been a document which describes the problem and lists the requirements.  The goal of this document is to describe the BIER IPv6 requirements, summarize the encapsulation modes of the proposed solutions, guide the working group in understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the various solutions, and help in the development of acceptable solutions.</t></abstract>
