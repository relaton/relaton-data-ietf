<abstract><t>This draft proposes a mechanism for bidirectional IPv4 communication between IPv4 Internet and end hosts or IPv4 networks sited in IPv6 access networks.  This mechanism follows the softwire hub &amp; spoke model and uses IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel as basic method to traverse IPv6 network.  By allocating public IPv4 addresses to end hosts/networks in IPv6, it can achieve IPv4 end-to-end bidirectional communication between IPv4 Internet and these hosts/networks.  This mechanism is an IPv4 access method for hosts and IPv4 networks sited in IPv6.</t></abstract>
