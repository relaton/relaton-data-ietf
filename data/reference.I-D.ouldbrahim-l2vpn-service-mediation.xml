<abstract><t>[SWALLOW-IW] describes an approach for interworking a native ATM SPVC segment with an ATM/FR-based pseudowire. The approach requires that an ATM edge device to encode the remote MPLS provider edge IP address within the NSAP destination address per call-basis, and covers mostly ATM and FRF.8 specifications. This draft covers other scenarios where a) the native layer-2 edge doesn’t have a priori knowledge of the remote PE IP addresses, b) the Layer-2 Provider Edge and the layer-2 network can be native Frame Relay (FR) using native layer-2 signaling protocols, c) the native layer-2 network can use not only NSAP addressing but as well E.164, X.121, or any preferred native addressing scheme, and d) the interface between the MPLS/IP network and native layer-2 network can be FRF.10/X.76 interface. We refer to the above problem space as "Service Mediation" to indicate that the native layer-2 signaling is terminated at the MPLS/IP device attached to the layer-2 network and the "mediated" service is an end-to-end connection built from two segments: one segment is in its native layer-2 form which we denote as Native Wire (NW) established using native layer-2 signaling protocols and the other segment is a pseudowire (PW) established using PWE3/L2VPN signaling protocols.</t></abstract>
