<abstract><t>The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings, and over the past few years several approaches to a better Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) have been discussed and proposed.  Among these shortcomings, different registries operate different WHOIS services.  For users this implies that several WHOIS queries to different registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a given resource.  This document describes a redirection service for RESTful WHOIS queries.  This service allows users to query a single WHOIS service and be redirected to the authoritative registry.  The solution implemented proposed here applies to Regional Internet Registries(RIRs) and Domain Name Registries(DNRs).</t></abstract>
