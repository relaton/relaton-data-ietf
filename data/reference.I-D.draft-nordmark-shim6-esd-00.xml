<abstract><t>The Shim6 protocol provides for locator agility while satisfying the 'first, do no harm' security requirements. This document outlines some extensions to Shim6 that in addition provides complete separation between identifiers and locators, and allows routers to rewrite the locators in the shim6 packets as a way to provide traffic engineering information to the hosts. The document also outlines a simple extension to allow shim6, with a CGA upper-layer ID, to operate using IPv4 addresses as locators. The purpose of this outline is to stimulate discussions.</t></abstract>
