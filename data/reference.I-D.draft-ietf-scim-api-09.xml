<abstract><t>The System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification is designed to make managing user identity in multi-domain based applications and services easier using HTTP Protocol.  Examples include but are not limited to enterprise to cloud service providers, and inter-cloud based scenarios.  The specification suite seeks to build upon experience with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing authentication, authorization, and privacy models. It's intent is to reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by providing a common user schema and extension model, as well as binding documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using standard protocols.  In essence, make it fast, cheap, and easy to move users in to, out of, and around the cloud.</t></abstract>
