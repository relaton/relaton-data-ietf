<abstract><t>The specific mechanism described in the current PMIPv6 draft to support multihoming is such that a different unique prefix is given to each interface of a Mobile Node that is attached to the PMIPv6 domain.  However, multihoming can also be provided using single prefix for all interfaces of MN.  This memo explores and highlights some issues associated with multihoming support in PMIPv6: using single prefix per MN method or multiple prefixes per MN method.</t></abstract>
