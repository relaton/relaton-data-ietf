<abstract><t>This RFC specifies a draft standard for the ARPA Internet community.    It describes a resource location protocol for use in the ARPA    Internet.  It is most useful on networks employing technologies which    support some method of broadcast addressing, however it may also be    used on other types of networks.  For maximum benefit, all hosts    which provide significant resources or services to other hosts on the    Internet should implement this protocol.  Hosts failing to implement    the Resource Location Protocol risk being ignored by other hosts    which are attempting to locate resources on the Internet.</t></abstract>
