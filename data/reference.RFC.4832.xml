<abstract><t>This document discusses security threats to network-based localized mobility management.  Threats may occur on two interfaces: the interface between a localized mobility anchor and a mobile access gateway, as well as the interface between a mobile access gateway and a mobile node.  Threats to the former interface impact the localized mobility management protocol itself.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
