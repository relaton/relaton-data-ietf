<abstract><t>Different hypervisors are used in SDN network in cloud datacenters, such as KVM, VMware ESXi and Xen. However, different hypervisors are not well supported by SDN network to some degrees.  In order to solve the problems with hypervisor VMware ESXi and Xen, decoupling schemes for hypervisor from SDN architecture are presented.  Through different decoupling schemes, we want to find a better way in order to get the overall view by the SDN network.</t></abstract>
