<abstract><t>This is a submission for the creation of an new IANA Time Zones registration process. This is intended to be a central repository for time zone names. The registry does not presume to be the authority for time zone information or rules. This register is simply a place where time zone names may be registered for public access. This registery only registers time zone names. The description of the time zone is not included in this memo. Vendors and services companies can elect to provide time zone servers that publish time zone information details.</t></abstract>
