<abstract><t>This document describes the "Bump-In-the-API" (BIA) host based protocol translation mechanism that allows applications supporting only one IP address family to communicate with peers that are reachable or supporting only the other address family.  This specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided dual stack, IPv6 only or IPv4 only network connectivity.  In the dual stack network case, single address family applications in the host sometime will communicate directly with other hosts using the different address family.  In the case of IPv6 only network or IPv6 only destination, IPv4- originated communications have to be translated into IPv6.  IPv6 communications may have to be translated similarly to IPv4.  Technically, the BIA-enabled host resolves both A and AAAA addresses of the destination and behaves according to received responses.  Acknowledgement of previous work  This document is an update to and directly derivative from Seungyun Lee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin Kim, Alain Durand, and Erik Nordmark's [RFC3338], which similarly provides a dual stack host means to communicate with other IPv6 host using existing IPv4 appliations.The original document was a product of the NGTRANS working group.  The changes in this document reflect four components  1.  Supporting IPv6 only network connections  2.  Supporting IPv4 only network connections  3.  Removing Applicability and Disclaimer  4.  Supporting dual stack network connections with translation  The goal of this mechanism is the same as that of the Bump-in-the- stack mechanism, but this mechanism provides the translation method between the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs.  Thus, the goal is simply achieved without IP header translation.</t></abstract>
