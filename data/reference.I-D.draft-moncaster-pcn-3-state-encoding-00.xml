<abstract><t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protect the Quality of Service of inelastic flows.  It does this by marking packets when traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded a threshold below the physical link rate.  This baseline encoding specified how two encoding states could be encoded into the IP header.  This document specified an extension to the baseline encoding that enables three encoding states to be carried in the IP header as well as enabling limited support for end-to-end ECN.  Status  This memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually be published as an experimental RFC.</t></abstract>
