<abstract><t>This document specifies a new BGP SAFI, Information SAFI. A BGP update message of this SAFI contains an NLRI which uniquely identifies the BGP speaker that originated the update. The purpose of such an update is to carry attributes that impart information about the BGP speaker which may be of interest to other BGP speakers. For instance, if one BGP speaker needs to use an IP-based encapsulation in order to deliver traffic to a second, the second BGP speaker can use this SAFI to specify information about the encapsulation header that it expects. A BGP tunnel attribute is specified for this purpose. Other attributes, including communities and/or extended communities, can also be included.</t></abstract>
