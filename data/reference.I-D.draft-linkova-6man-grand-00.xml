<abstract><t>Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain reachability information.  This document updates [RFC4861] to allow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned to a host.  It also updates [RFC4862] and [RFC4429] recommending hosts to send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6 address.  The proposed change will minimize the delay and packet loss when a host initiate connections to off-link destination from a new IPv6 address.</t></abstract>
