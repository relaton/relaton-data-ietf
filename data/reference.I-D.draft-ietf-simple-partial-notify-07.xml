<abstract><t>By default, presence delivered using the Presence Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol is represented in the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF). A PIDF document contains a set of elements, each representing a different aspect of the presence being reported. When any subset of the elements change, even just a single element, a new document containing the full set of elements is delivered. This memo defines an extension allowing delivery of presence data that has actually changed.</t></abstract>
