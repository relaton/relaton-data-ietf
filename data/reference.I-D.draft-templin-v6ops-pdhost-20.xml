<abstract><t>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which assign them to their downstream-attached links and networks.  The requesting node can provision the prefix according to whether it acts as a router on behalf of any downstream networks and/or as a host on behalf of its local applications.  In the latter case, the requesting node can use portions of the delegated prefix for its own multi- addressing purposes.  This document therefore considers prefix delegation models for both the classic routing and multi-addressing use cases.</t></abstract>
