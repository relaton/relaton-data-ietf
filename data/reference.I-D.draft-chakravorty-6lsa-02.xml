<abstract><t>This specification provides an architectural framework, called IPv6 Label Switching Architecture or 6LSA, for an end-to-end, IP-centric packet transmission technique that uses the IPv6 packet header Flow Label to establish IPv6-based label switched paths. The label switched paths, called 6LSPs, provide application and user specified routes for efficient transport of packets and as means for quality of service (QoS) or other service delivery. Through look-ups of 20-bit labels instead of 128-bit IPv6 addresses, the architecture provides potential memory and processing savings, the latter through significantly reduced address fetches for the low-powered, handheld devices. Although the label from the source is delivered to the destination unmodified as required for conformance to the basic tenet of the existing defintion of the 3-tuple flow, the intermediate network nodes in 6LSA are allowed to temporarily replace the original label with a label of local significance. This enables 6LSA flows to be hop-specific although session-based and as such a unique QoS delivery technique for bandwidth constrained media. 6LSA also enhances security since label generation and assignment algorithms can be modified periodically.</t></abstract>
