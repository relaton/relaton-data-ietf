<abstract><t>Due to the extremely large scale of P2P overlay networks, complexity has become a major issue. With the number of connected nodes reaching into the millions, a platform which can accurately simulate an overlay network is important. Many freely available network simulators exist, ranging from modelling networks at the packet level to concentrating purely on the overlay network. The following document provides an overview of these simulators, documenting the maximum number of simulated nodes achieved in experiments, the P2P overlay architectures modelled and the chosen implementation language.</t></abstract>
