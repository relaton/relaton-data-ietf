<abstract><t>This document is a product of the work of MIF architecture design team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues, experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks.  The framework defines the notion of a Provisioning Domain (PVD) - a consistent set of network configuration information, and PVD-aware nodes - nodes which learn PVDs from the attached network(s) and/or other sources and manage and use multiple PVDs for connectivity separately and consistently.</t></abstract>
