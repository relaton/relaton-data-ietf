<abstract><t>Internet protocols that deal with presence-based location objects support a wide variety of applications.  However, the dissemination of location objects from sources of location to consumers is a common feature of all location-based applications.  In order to enable the development of broadly-applicable security and privacy mechanisms for dissemination of location objects, this document describes an end-to- end architecture for policy-constrained location distribution.  In this architecture, location distribution is accomplished by a set of distributed actors.  We describe the assurances that these actors require from the architecture, and derive more a more detailed description of the security features required to provide those assurances.</t></abstract>
