<abstract><t>This memo describes a MIB module that provides a conceptual layer between high-level &quot;network-wide&quot; policy definitions that effect configuration of the Differentiated Services (diffserv) subsystem and the instance-specific information that would include such details as the parameters for all the queues associated with each interface in a system.  This essentially provides an interface for configuring differentiated services at a conceptually higher layer than that of the Differentiated Services MIB.  [PROPOSED STANDARD]</t></abstract>
