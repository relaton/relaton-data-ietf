<abstract><t>This memo formally defines the overall email address maximum length to 254 characters (octets);  Relaxes local-part limitation set by RFC 821/2821/5321;  Obsoletes domain-part limitation set by RFC 821/2821/5321; AND  Uses the mechanism described in RFC 1869 to define an extension with keyword "EAML" to the SMTP service whereby an SMTP server can declare that it is capable of handling longer email addresses.</t></abstract>
