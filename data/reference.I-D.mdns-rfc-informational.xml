<abstract><t>This document describes a globally scalable and hierarchical approach to multicast session directory service architecture.  This approach allows for sessions to be discovered using keywords as soon as they are registered with the system.  It allows session registration to be tagged with geographical data to provide location-based search capability to the end users.  It is able to assign URI strings to multicast sessions.  This document provides a general overview of the architecture and describes the protocol used.  The architecture is able to operate in networks supporting either traditional ASM or the newer SSM.</t></abstract>
