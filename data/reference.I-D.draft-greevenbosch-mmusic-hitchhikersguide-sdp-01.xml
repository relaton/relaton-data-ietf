<abstract><t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SDP) is the subject of numerous specifications that have been produced by the IETF.  It can be difficult to locate the right document, or even to determine the set of Request for Comments (RFC) about SDP.  This specification serves as a guide to the SDP RFC series.  It lists a current snapshot of the specifications under the SDP umbrella, briefly summarises each, and groups them into categories.  Note  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to mmusic@ietf.org.</t></abstract>
