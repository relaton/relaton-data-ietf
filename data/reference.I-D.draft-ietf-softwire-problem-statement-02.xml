<abstract><t>The Softwires Working Group is specifying the standardization of discovery, control and encapsulation methods for connecting IPv4 networks across IPv6-only networks and IPv6 networks across IPv4-only networks in a way that will encourage multiple, inter-operable vendor implementations. At the highest level, the Softwires Working Group is tasked to identify, and extend where necessary, standard protocols to support a selected set of "IPv4/IPv6" and "IPv6/IPv4" transition problems. This document describes the specific problems ("Hubs and Spokes" and "Mesh") that will be solved as part of a solution phase following the completion of this document, within a relatively tight "time-to-market" as requested by operators at IETF 63. Some individual requirements (and non-requirements) are also identified in this document at times in order to better describe the specific scope for a given problem definition.</t></abstract>
