<abstract><t>In this draft, MMP-SCTP (MMP: Mobile Multi-Path) is proposed to allow a host to improve the transmission throughput in wireless mobile networks using simultaneous multi-path transmission of Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Relevant mobility issues of MMP-SCTP included are: (1) data transmission modes and path selection, (2) multi-path handover, and (3) location management. Two transmission modes of MMP- SCTP, i.e., the "Data-duplicating Mode" and "Data-striping Mode", and the switching mechanism, are designed to enhance transmission throughput for different wireless link status. Since the transmission paths used for MMP-SCTP may differ when an MMP-SCTP host moves, the multi-path handover problem is defined, and a multi-path handover mechanism for MMP-SCTP is proposed. Additionally, a location management scheme is also designed in this draft to tackle the locating of an MMP-SCTP host.</t></abstract>
