<abstract><t>This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for the Content-Disposition header field in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).  The treatment of &quot;early-session&quot; bodies is similar to the treatment of &quot;session&quot; bodies.  That is, they follow the offer/answer model.  Their only difference is that session descriptions whose disposition type is &quot;early-session&quot; are used to establish early media sessions within early dialogs, as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialogs.
