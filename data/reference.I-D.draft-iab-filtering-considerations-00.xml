<abstract><t>The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium.  This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can allow communications that may be viewed as either desirable or undesirable by different parties.  Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or allegedly illegal communications.  Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on "blocking", the active prevention of abusive or allegedly illegal communications.  This document examines several technical approaches to Internet content blocking in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture.  In general, the approach to content blocking that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or illegal communications.</t></abstract>
