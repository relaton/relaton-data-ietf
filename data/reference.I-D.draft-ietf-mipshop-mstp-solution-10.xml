<abstract><t>This document describes a mobility services framework design (MSFD) for the IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) protocol that addresses identified issues associated with the transport of MIH messages.  The document also describes mechanisms for mobility service (MoS) discovery and transport layer mechanisms for the reliable delivery of MIH messages.  IESG Note  This document does not provide mechanisms for securing the communication between a mobile node (MN) and the mobility service (MoS).  Instead, it is assumed that either lower layer (e.g., link layer) security mechanisms, or overall system-specific proprietary security solutions, are used.  The details of such lower layer and/or proprietary mechanisms are beyond the scope of this document.  The IESG recommends against using this protocol without careful analysis that these mechanisms meet the desired requirements, and encourages future standardization work in this area.  The IEEE 802.21a Task Group has recently started work on MIH security issues that may provide some solution in this area.  For further information, please refer to Section 8.</t></abstract>
