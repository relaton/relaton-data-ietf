<abstract><t>The availability of broadband connections together with flat-rate pricing has made new types of peer-to-peer applications possible. From an Internet evolution and end user value point of view this is very exciting.  As a consequence, an increase of user-to-user traffic was observable all around the world over the last few years.  With the usage of p2p systems the observation can be made that a certain group of users, called high-consuming users, decided to use their flat-rate contract excessively.  This in turn seems to have caused network operators to take actions.  This document illustrates a couple of techniques used by operators today to deal with excessive bandwidth usage.  More information can improve the decision making process.</t></abstract>
