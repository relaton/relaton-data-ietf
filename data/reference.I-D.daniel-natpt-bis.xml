<abstract><t>This document specifies an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanism. This solution attempts to provide transparent routing to end-nodes in V6 realm trying to communicate with end-nodes in V4 realm and vice versa. This is achieved using a combination of Network Address Translation and Protocol Translation. The scheme described does not mandate dual stacks (i.e., IPv4 as well as V6 protocol support) or special purpose routing requirements (such as requiring tunneling support) on end nodes. This scheme is based on a combination of address translation scheme and V6/V4 protocol translation scheme.</t></abstract>
