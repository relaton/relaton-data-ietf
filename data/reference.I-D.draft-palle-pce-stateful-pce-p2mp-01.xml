<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an appropriate technology for the determination of the paths of point- to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-app] presents several use cases, demonstrating scenarios that benefit from the deployment of a stateful PCE.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provides the fundamental PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions needed to support stateful PCE functions.  This memo provides extensions required for PCEP so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability in supporting point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs.</t></abstract>
