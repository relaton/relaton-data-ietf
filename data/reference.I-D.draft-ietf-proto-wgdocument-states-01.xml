<abstract><t>This document contains definitions for all of the different states that documents (viz. Internet-Drafts) may experience while associated with an IETF working group.  The first state occurs when an I-D is submitted for consideration as a working group item, and the last state is either when the I-D is sent to the IESG for publication, or declared as "dead".  The intended purpose of this Internet-Draft is to serve as a basis for defining requirements to update the I-D tracker tool, to permit WG Chairs and other persons to view the progression of documents through IETF working groups.</t></abstract>
