<abstract><t>This document specifies the Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) protocol, which is used for interaction between iSNS servers and iSNS clients in order to facilitate automated discovery, management, and configuration of iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices (using iFCP gateways) on a TCP/IP network. iSNS provides intelligent storage discovery and management services comparable to those found in Fibre Channel networks, allowing a commodity IP network to function in a similar capacity as a storage area network. iSNS also facilitates a seamless integration of IP and Fibre Channel networks, due to its ability to emulate Fibre Channel fabric services, and manage both iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices. iSNS thereby provides value in any storage network comprised of iSCSI devices, Fibre Channel devices (using iFCP gateways), or any combination thereof.</t></abstract>
