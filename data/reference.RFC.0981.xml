<abstract><t>This document introduces wiretap algorithms, a class of experimental,    multiple routing algorithms that compute quasi-optimum routes for    stations sharing a packet-radio broadcast channel.  The primary route (a    minimum-distance path), and additional paths ordered by distance, which    serve as alternate routes should the primary route fail, are computed.    This prototype is presented as an example of a class of routing    algorithms and data-base management techniques that may find wider    application in the Internet community.  Discussions and suggestions for    improvements are welcomed.</t></abstract>
