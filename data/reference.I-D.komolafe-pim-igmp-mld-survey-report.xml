<abstract><t>The PIM WG intends to progress IGMPv3 and MLDv2 from Proposed Standards to Internet Standards.  The WG decided to conduct a survey of operators, vendors and implementors of these and related protocols to gather information about their implementation and deployment. This document presents the results of the survey and briefly summarizes the key findings.  The survey indicates that there is widespread deployment and usage of of IGMPv3 and MLDv2, with numerous independent implementations interoperating successfully.  No major issues with either protocol were identified and, similarly, no major unused features in the specifications were highlighted.  These findings suggest that IGMPv3 and MLDv2 are indeed ready for progression to Internet Standards.</t></abstract>
