<abstract><t>This document describes the Universal Voting Markup Language (UVML), a syntax that augments conventional text communications with a structured representation of opinion.  UVML consists of two top-level elements: ballot and query.  UVML enables voters to cast ballots (text, image, or video) that can be reliably interpreted by either human readers or automated-agents.  In addition to one or more votes, UVML-ballots may also contain the voter's demographic signature.  A voter can use UVML-queries to retrieve voting results and audit sample ballots over varying time frames, with the option of these being filtered by voter demographics.  The design of UVML leverages cross-cultural sentiment and voting-systems scholarship.</t></abstract>
