<abstract><t>BGP-4 is utilised as a key intra- and inter-Autonomous System routing protocol in modern IP networks.  The failure modes as defined by the original protocol standards are based on a number of assumptions around the impact of session failure.  Numerous incidents both in the global Internet routing table and within Service Provider networks have been caused by strict handling of a single invalid UPDATE message causing large-scale failures in one or more Autonomous Systems.  This memo describes the current use of BGP-4 within Service Provider networks, and outlines a set of requirements for further work to enhance the mechanisms available to a BGP-4 implementation when erroneous data is detected.  Whilst this document does not provide specification of any standard, it is intended as an overview of a set of enhancements to BGP-4 to improve the protocol's robustness to suit its current deployment.</t></abstract>
