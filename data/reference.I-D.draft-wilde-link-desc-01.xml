<abstract><t>Interactions with many resources on the Web are driven by links, and these links often define certain expectations about the interactions (such as HTTP methods being allowed, media types being accepted in the request, or URI templates being supported).  While these expectations are essential to define the possible interactions, it may be useful to further narrow them down by providing link descriptions, which can help clients to gain more runtime knowledge about the resource they are about to interact with.  This memo defines Link Descriptions, a model and associated media type that can be used to describe links by supporting descriptive markup for representing interaction information with links.  Link Descriptions can be used by media types (by inclusion or by reference) that seek to make Link Descriptions runtime-capable, without having to create their own representation for them.</t></abstract>
