<abstract><t>The 3rd Generation Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) is the primary authentication mechanism for devices wishing to access mobile networks.  RFC 4187 (EAP-AKA) made the use of this mechanism possible within the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework.  RFC 5448 (EAP-AKA') was an improved version of EAP-AKA.  This memo is an update of the specification for EAP-AKA'.  This version obsoletes RFC 5448.  EAP-AKA' differs from EAP-AKA by providing a key derivation function that binds the keys derived within the method to the name of the access network.  The key derivation function has been defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).  EAP-AKA' allows its use in EAP in an interoperable manner.  EAP-AKA' is also an algorithm update, as it employs SHA-256 instead of SHA-1 as in EAP-AKA.  This version of EAP-AKA' specification specifies the protocol behaviour for 5G deployments as well.</t></abstract>
