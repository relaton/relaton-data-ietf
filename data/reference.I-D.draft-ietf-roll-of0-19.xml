<abstract><t>The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) specification defines a generic Distance Vector protocol that is adapted to a variety of networks types by the application of specific Objective Functions (OFs).  An OF states the outcome of the process used by a RPL node to select and optimize routes within a RPL Instance based on the information objects available; an OF is not an algorithm.  This document specifies a basic Objective Function that relies only on the objects that are defined in RPL and does not use any protocol extension</t></abstract>
