      The security enhancement is one of the most important enhancements
      to IP multicast. IP multicast requires many security functions that
      include user authentication of IP multicast, encryption of IP
      multicast datagrams and key management protocols for IP multicast.
      Among them, the user authentication function for IP multicast is
      considered one of the most important security functions for IP
      multicast. This document describes the extension to IGMP, version 2
      (IGMPv2) [1] for the authentication of IP multicast senders and
      receivers, which prevents an unauthorized user from sending and
      receiving IP multicast datagrams.
