<abstract><t>We introduce a new class of model based metrics designed to determine if a complete Internet path can meet predefined bulk transport performance targets by applying a suite of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths.  The subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to key infrastructure, such as interconnects or even individual devices, to accurately detect if any part of the infrastructure will prevent any path traversing it from meeting the specified target performance.  The diagnostic tests consist of precomputed traffic patterns and statistical criteria for evaluating packet delivery.  The traffic patterns are precomputed to mimic TCP or other transport protocol over a long path but are constructed in such a way that they are independent of the actual details of the subpath under test, end systems or applications.  Likewise the success criteria depends on the packet delivery statistics of the subpath, as evaluated against a protocol model applied to the target performance.  The success criteria also does not depend on the details of the subpath, end systems or application.  This makes the measurements open loop, eliminating most of the difficulties encountered by traditional bulk transport metrics.  Model based metrics exhibit several important new properties not present in other Bulk Capacity Metrics, including the ability to reason about concatenated or overlapping subpaths.  The results are vantage independent which is critical for supporting independent validation of tests results from multiple Measurement Points.  This document does not define diagnostic tests directly, but provides a framework for designing suites of IP diagnostics tests that are tailored to confirming that infrastructure can meet a predetermined target performance.
