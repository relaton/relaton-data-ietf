<abstract><t>The IPSec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in order to provide security services. The Internet Key Exchange (IKE [RFC2409] and IKEv2 [IKEv2]) provide a mechanism to negotiate which algorithms should be used in any even association. However to ensure interoperability between disparate implementations it is necessary to specify a set of mandatory to implement algorithms to ensure at least one algorithm that all implementations will have available. This document defines the current set of mandatory to implement algorithms for use of IKEv2 as well as specifying algorithms that should be implemented because they made be promoted to mandatory at some future time.</t></abstract>
