<abstract><t>Transmission capacity sharing TCP flows tend to synchronize among each other. This way rate variations of the individual flows, which are caused by the congestion control algorithms, do not even out. The effect is known as global synchronization. Large queuing buffer demand and large latency and jitter are the consequences. Global Synchronization Protection (GSP) is an extension of regular tail drop packet queuing schemes that prevents global synchronization. For large traffic aggregates the de-correlation between the individual flow variations reduces buffer demand and packet sojourn time by an order of magnitude and more. Even though quite simple, the solution has a theoretical rationale and is not heuristic, and it has been tested with a Linux implementation.</t></abstract>
