<abstract><t>Multi-segment pseudo wires have been defined to enable emulated layer 1 and layer 2 services to be delivered from an IP based packet switched network over a sparse mesh of PSN tunnels and PW control protocol adjacencies. MS-PWs can be used to scale PW based networks over both a single AS, or between multiple ASs. However, there is a particular need to be able to automatically route MS-PWs through access and metro PSNs. These networks typically comprise a single AS. This draft proposes extensions to OSPF to enable the automatic advertisement of summarized PW FECs, thus enabling the automatic routing of MS-PWs across an OSPF domain.</t></abstract>
