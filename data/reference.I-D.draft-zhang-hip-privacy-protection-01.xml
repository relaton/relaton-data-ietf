<abstract><t>In this document, we propose an extension of HIP Base Exchange (BEX) which facilitates HIP hosts to protect their identity privacy. Apart from describing the protocol and packet formats, we also attempt to analyze the applicability and the security strength of the proposed approach. This work is based on BLIND [YLI04].</t></abstract>
