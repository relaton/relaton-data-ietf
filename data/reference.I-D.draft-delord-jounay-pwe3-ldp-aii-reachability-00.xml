<abstract><t>The dynamic End-to-End Multisegment pseudowire setup requires PEs to maintain a pseudowire routing table when using FEC129. There is therefore a requirement for automatic Attachment Individual Identifiers discovery. Two mechanisms already exist, a BGP based solution and an IGP based one. Here we define a third solution relying on LDP. It allows for automatic discovery when a PE does not run BGP or IGP. The mechanism described here only runs on the on the T-LDP (Targeted LDP) session between the T-PE and S-PE, but not on any other LDP session which may exist for the tunnels. The T-PE advertises its locally attached AIIs only for the S-PE to build its PW routing table (the S-PE does not propagate this information further via this mechanism). The mechanism described here is intended to complement and interwork with other existing autodiscovery and routing mechanisms already described with BGP and OSPF.</t></abstract>
