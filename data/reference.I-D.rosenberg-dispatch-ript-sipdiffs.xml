<abstract><t>The Real-Time Internet Peering for Telephony (RIPT) protocol and its extension for inbound calls to single user devices provide an alternative to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for several use cases.  This leads to many questions - how is RIPT different from SIP and why?  What should be standardized and what should not?  How much of SIP do those two specifications replace?  This document discusses the differences and their motivations, and presents an analysis across the set of SIP specifications, and analyzes whether the two RIPT documents replace each with similar capability, whether they eliminate the need for that specification, or whether some or all of that specification are not addressed by RIPT.</t></abstract>
