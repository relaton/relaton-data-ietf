<abstract><t>The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters.  This has lead to a situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers make different assumptions based on the locales they are running in. There is little interoperability for characters in the ISO-8859-1 character set, and even less interoperability for any characters beyond that.  This document defines a backwards-compatible extension to "Basic", specifying the server's character encoding expectation, using a new authentication scheme parameter.</t></abstract>
