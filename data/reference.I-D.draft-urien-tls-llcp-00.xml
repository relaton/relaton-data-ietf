<abstract><t>This document describes the implementation, named LLCPS, of the TLS protocol over the NFC (Near Field Communication) LLCP layer. The NFC peer to peer (P2P) protocol may be used by any application that needs communication between two devices at very small distances (a few centimeters). LLCPS enforces a strong security in NFC P2P exchanges, and may be deployed for many services, in the Internet Of Things ecosystem, such as access control or ticketing operations.</t></abstract>
