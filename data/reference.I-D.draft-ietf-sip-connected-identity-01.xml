<abstract><t>Because of retargeting of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) dialog- forming request, the User Agent Server (UAS) can have a different identity from that in the To header field. This document provides a means for that User Agent (UA) to supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in the reverse direction and for that identity to be signed by an Authentication Service. The same mechanism can be used to indicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some action in a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) behind a gateway. This document normatively updates RFC 3261 (SIP). This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
