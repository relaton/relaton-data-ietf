<abstract><t>The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861] specifies the operation of routers, including the process of sending and receiving Router Advertisement (RA) messages.  However, the specification makes no distinction between different classes of routers that may occur on a link.  In particular, the specification is written from the perspective of routers that are "authoritative for the link", i.e., routers that connect the link to provider networks.  This document discusses considerations for a different class of routers known as "stub routers".</t></abstract>
