<abstract><t>This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by a DNSSEC enabled Recursive Nameserver configured as a forwarder to send a single query over TCP requesting to receive a complete validation path along with the regular query answer.  Additionally, use of this option is considered a request to keep the TCP connection open to serve additional DNS requests.  Use of this option significantly reduces DNS latency for hosts deploying DNSSEC.</t></abstract>
