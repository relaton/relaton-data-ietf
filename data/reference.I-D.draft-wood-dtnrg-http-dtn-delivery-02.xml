<abstract><t>This document describes how to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP, for communication across delay- and disruption-tolerant networks, by making every transit node in the network HTTP-capable, and doing peer HTTP transfers between nodes to move data hop-by-hop or subnet-by-subnet towards its final destination.  HTTP is well- known and straightforward to implement in these networks.</t></abstract>
