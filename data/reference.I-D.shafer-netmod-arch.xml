<abstract><t>NETCONF and YANG are pieces of an ambitious plan to improve network management.  NETCONF gives access to native capabilities of the devices within a network, defining methods for manipulating configuration databases, retrieving operational data, and invoking specific operations.  YANG provides the means to define the content trafficked via NETCONF, both data and operations.  Using both technologies, the standards modules can be defined to give interoperability and commonality to devices, while still allowing devices to express their unique capabilities.  This document describes how NETCONF and YANG help build network management applications that meet the needs of network services providers.  An architecture is described which is friendly to both devices and applications, to vendors and standards bodies, to young and to old, to red states and to blue states.  It's a startling vision, coming to networks near you starting August, 2009.</t></abstract>
