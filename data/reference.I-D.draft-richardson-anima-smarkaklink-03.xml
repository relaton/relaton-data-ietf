<abstract><t>This document details the mechanism used for initial enrollment using a smartphone of a BRSKI Registrar system.</t><t> There are two key differences in assumption from [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]: that the intended registrar has Internet, and that the Pledge has no user-interface.</t><t> This variation on BRSKI is intended to be used in the situation where the registrar device is new out of the box and is the intended gateway to the Internet (such as a home gateway), but has not yet been configured.  This work is also intended as a transition to the Wi-Fi Alliance work on the Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP).</t></abstract>
