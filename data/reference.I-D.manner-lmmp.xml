<abstract><t>Mobile IP (MIP) is the well-known protocol to handle the mobility of IP-based mobile nodes (MN). However, MIP has some drawbacks, including high latency in updates during a handover, and the need for infrastructure in the home networks of MNs. To enhance the mobility of nodes within a single domain, an access network (AN), several local mobility (also called micro mobility) management protocols have been suggested. All these protocols have their strengths and drawbacks. The deployment of these protocols is a chicken and egg problem, since both the AN and the MNs must support the same protocol. This draft presents a new protocol that can be used to replace the communication between the AN and the MNs in the existing local mobility management schemes. The protocol hides from MNs the AN-internal mobility management mechanisms and, therefore, allows MNs to log in to and roam within any AN regardless of the local mobility scheme used.</t></abstract>
