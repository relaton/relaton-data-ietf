<abstract><t>Watching videos (Contents) from mobile devices has been causing most of the network traffic and is projected to remain to increase exponentially. Thus, numerous types of content and chunk based caching schemes have been proposed to handle the increasing traffic. Those caching schemes cache the whole videos at the edge nodes, but most of the users view only the beginning of the videos. Hence, caching the complete video on the edge node is an ineffective solution to reduce the network traffic as well as to improve the cache utilization. Thus, a chunk-level caching scheme to store popular videos partially and a smart prefetching scheme is needed to provide the missing chunks of the video.  This Internet-Draft will expire on August 09, 2021.</t></abstract>
