<abstract><t>This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for DNS names of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as appliances and sensors.  By this scheme, the DNS name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with the device's category and model in a network such as home network and office network.  This DNS name lets IoT users (e.g., home residents) easily identify each device for monitoring and remote-controlling it in the network.</t></abstract>
