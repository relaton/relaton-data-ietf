<abstract><t>This document defines a new domain, _service., which can be used for automatic service configuration and discovery. The associated anycast prefixes can be used to configure a default DNS server, which provides lookups for a local _service. domain but also acts as a (caching) recursive DNS server, thus allowing DNS clients to use this well-known address as their default DNS server as well as to use it to find various well known services, thus avoiding manual configuration.</t></abstract>
