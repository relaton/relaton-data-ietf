<abstract><t>Network survivability is the network's ability to restore traffic delivery following failure of network resources or an attack on the network.  It plays a critical role in the delivery of guaranteed services in transport networks to meet the requirements expressed in Service Level Agreements (SLAs).  The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is a packet transport technology based on the MPLS data plane and re-using many aspects of the MPLS management and control planes.  This document provides a framework for the provision of survivability functions in the data plane of an MPLS-TP network using tools provided by the management plane and the control plane as well as techniques inherent in the data plane itself.  This document is a product of a joint International Telecommunications Union (ITU)-IETF effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T).</t></abstract>
