<abstract><t>People like their computers to work quickly.  During the transition to new technology, both old and new technologies have to peacefully co-exist.  However, if users experience connection delays attributed to the new technology the new technology will be shunned.  HTTP ("The Web") is one of the most visible and time-critical applications that is used by nearly every Internet user.  It is critical that new technologies which improve HTTP not impair or delay the display of HTTP content.  It is also important that users retain the ability to share URIs amongst friends and colleagues, even if the other users have not upgraded to the new technology.  This draft makes several recommendations to ensure user satisfaction and a smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 with dual-stack hosts.  The audience for this draft is application developers and content providers.  This draft is discussed on the v6oops mailing list, https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/v6ops.</t></abstract>
