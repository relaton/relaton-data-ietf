<abstract><t>In LTE (Long Term Evolution) bearer network, there will be a large number of network elements and service tunnels which will bring a lot of configuration work. The cost will be very high if all these work is performed manually.  In order to reduce the workload of configuration to minimum, the following questions should be considered:  o How to establish the DCN (Data Communication Network) connections  automatically to avoid making configuration locally?  o How to establish the DCN connections automatically between  different vendors' network elements or how to pass through  different service providers' network?  o How to get network element and link information of the real  network based on the information from network planning?  o How to generate configuration scripts to setup network and service  links automatically in order to reduce configuration design  workload.  LTE is a typical scenario which involves large number of network elements and service tunnels. Other scenarios like IPTV may also have network configuration problems discussed in this document.  This document discusses problems related to lightening network configuration workload and better transmission tunnel setup between network elements and NMS (Network Management System).</t></abstract>
