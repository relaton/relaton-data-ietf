<abstract><t>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) identifiers document [RFC6370] specifies an initial set of identifiers, such as local assigned tunnel number and Global_ID, which can be used to form Maintenance Entity Point Identifier (MEP_ID).  As to some Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions, such as Connectivity Verification (CV) [RFC6428], source MEP_ID must be inserted in the OAM packets, so that the peer endpoint can compare the received and expected MEP_IDs to judge whether there is a mismatch [RFC6371], which means that the two MEP nodes need to pre-store each other's MEP_IDs.  This document defines the signaling extensions to exchange the Label Switched Path (LSP) identifiers.</t></abstract>
