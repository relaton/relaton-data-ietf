<abstract><t>This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism for providing IPv4 connectivity service to end users over a service provider's IPv6 network infrastructure.  During the long transition period from IPv4-only to IPv6-only, a service provider's network infrastructure will have to deploy IPv6.  But it will also have to maintain some IPv4 connectivity for a number of customers, for both outgoing and incoming connections, and for both customer-individual and shared IPv4 addresses.  The 4rd solution (IPv4 Residual Deployment) is designed as a lightweight solution for this.  In some scenarios, 4rd can dispense ISPs from supporting any NAT in their infrastructures.  In some others it can be used in parallel with NAT-based solutions such as DS-lite and/or NAT64/DNS4.</t></abstract>
