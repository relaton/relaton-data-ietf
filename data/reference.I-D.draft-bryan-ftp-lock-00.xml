<abstract><t>One of the biggest hurdles for FTP in real life usage is its use of two connections.  First, it uses a primary connection to send control commands on, and when it sends or receives data, it opens a second TCP stream for that purpose.  This document specifies a new FTP LOCK command to be used by clients to request the server to use the control connection for data transfers, using a single port instead of two.</t></abstract>
