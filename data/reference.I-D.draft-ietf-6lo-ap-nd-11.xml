<abstract><t>This document specifies an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol defined in RFC6775 and updated in RFC8505.  The new extension is called Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP-ND) and it protects the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks in a low-power and lossy network (LLN).  Nodes supporting this extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto- ID) and use it with one or more of their Registered Addresses.  The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses.  Once an address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof-of-ownership is provided, only the owner of that address can modify the registration information, thereby enforcing Source Address Validation.</t></abstract>
