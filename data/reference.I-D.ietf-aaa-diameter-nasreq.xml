<abstract><t>This document describes the Diameter protocol application used for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) services in the Network Access Server (NAS) environment. This application specification, when combined with the Diameter Base protocol, Transport Profile, and Extensible Authentication Protocol specifications, satisfies typical network access services requirements. Initial deployments of the Diameter protocol are expected to include legacy systems. Therefore, this application was carefully designed to ease the burden of protocol conversion between RADIUS and Diameter. This is achieved by including the RADIUS attribute space, and eliminating the need to perform many attribute translations.</t></abstract>
