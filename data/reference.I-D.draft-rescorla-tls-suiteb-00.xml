<abstract><t>RFC 4492 describes elliptic curve cipher suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, all those cipher suites use SHA-1 as their MAC algorithm, which makes them unsuitable for some applications. This document describes eight new CipherSuites for TLS/DTLS which specify stronger digest algorithms and therefore are suitable for use in applications which require compliance with the United States Government's guidelines for "NSA Suite B Cryptography" dated July, 2005.</t></abstract>
