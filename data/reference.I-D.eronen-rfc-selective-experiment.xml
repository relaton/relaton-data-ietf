<abstract><t>This document proposes an RFC 3933 [RFC3933] experiment for the IETF RFC publication process. The experiment is limited in scope and duration. The specific experiment has been chosen because (a) it has potential to provide a significant process improvement, (b) it can be executed at a low cost, (c) it addresses a widely recognized problem in the IETF process, and (d) tool support can be (and has been) built for it. The experiment relates to the copyediting and other manual tasks in the publication process. Specifically, the amount of work these manual tasks require differs widely between drafts, and for a certain subset of drafts there are either very minor editorial changes or no changes needed at all, if we discount the different formatting requirements between RFCs and drafts. The experiment involves identification of this subset of drafts and processing them separately with a "fast path" process that uses almost entirely automated processes. For the drafts that belong to this subset, it is expected that the RFC Editor queuing time is reduced from months or years to weeks or less.</t></abstract>
