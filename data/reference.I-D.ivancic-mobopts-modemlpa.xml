<abstract><t>Nework devices and applications are increasingly connected to a variety of smart modems whose incoming and outgoing link rates can be varied over time to suit the channel characteristics.  Such rate changes can result from use of adaptive coding and modulation.  The link rate and conditions offered by the modem to connected devices therefore vary.  In order for connected devices and applications to get the most out of the modem's link capacity, it is necessary for the applications and connected devices to condition traffic.  Thus, they need some knowledge of the modem's link conditions.  This document describes one simple method for a modem to advertise link rate and other characteristics, via UDP messages, and discusses alternative approaches to communicating this information.  While the mechanism in this document is described in the context of a modem, it can also be broadly applied to other scenarios such as cryptographic devices.</t></abstract>
