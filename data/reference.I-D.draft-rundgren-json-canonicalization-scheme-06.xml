<abstract><t>Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing requires that the original data does not change during serialization or parsing.  One way addressing this issue is creating a canonical form of the data. Canonicalization also permits data to be exchanged in its original form on the "wire" while still being subject to secure cryptographic operations.  The JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) provides canonicalization support for data in the JSON format by building on the strict serialization methods for JSON primitives defined by ECMAScript, constraining JSON data to the I-JSON subset, and through a deterministic property sorting scheme.</t></abstract>
