<abstract><t>There has been, for several years, a rising concern over the energy usage of large scale networks.  This concern is strongly focused on campus, data center, and other highly concentrated deployments of network infrastructure.  Given the steadily increasing demand for higher network speeds, always-on service models, and ubiquitous network coverage, it is also of growing importance for telecommunication networks both local and wide area in scope.  One of the issues in moving forward to reduce energy usage is to ensure that the network can still meet the performance specifications required to support the applications running over it.  This document provides an overview of the various areas of concern in the interaction between network performance and efforts at energy aware control planes, as a guide for those working on modifying current control planes or designing new control planes to improve the energy efficiency of high density, highly complex, network deployments.</t></abstract>
