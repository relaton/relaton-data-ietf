<abstract><t>The NetLMM WG has specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) for network- based localized mobility management, taking basic support for registration, de-registration and handover of Mobile Node (MN) into account in the RFC 5213 [1]. Although the mobile multicast provision in the PMIPv6 network is being discussed in the multimob WG, how to provide the service connectivity during the movement of MN which is a multicast source, is a problem still up in the air for the PMIPv6. This document discusses the extension of the PMIPv6 to support the multicast source mobility.</t></abstract>
