<abstract><t>The Platform Security Architecture (PSA) is a family of hardware and firmware security specifications, as well as open-source reference implementations, to help device makers and chip manufacturers build best-practice security into products.  Devices that are PSA compliant are able to produce attestation tokens as described in this memo, which are the basis for a number of different protocols, including secure provisioning and network access control.  This document specifies the PSA attestation token structure and semantics.</t><t> The PSA attestation token is a profiled Entity Attestation Token (EAT).</t><t> This specification describes what claims are used in an attestation token generated by PSA compliant systems, how these claims get serialized to the wire, and how they are cryptographically protected.</t></abstract>
