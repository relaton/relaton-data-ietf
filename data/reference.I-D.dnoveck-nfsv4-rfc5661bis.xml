<abstract><t>This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and is considered a separate protocol.</t><t> This document obsoletes RFC 8881.  In addition to many corrections and clarifications, it relies on NFSv4-wide documents to substantially revise the treatment of protocol extension, internationalization, and security, superseding the descriptions of those aspects of the protocol appearing in RFCs 5661 and 8881.</t></abstract>
