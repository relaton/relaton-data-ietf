<abstract><t>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends the MPLS control plane to encompass layer 2, time-division, wavelength and spatial switching. Along with the current development on IP over optical switching, considerable advances in optical transport systems based on the multiple optical switching granularities have been developed. Currently, GMPLS considers two layers of optical granularity using wavelengths and fibers. By introducing an extended definition of waveband switching, this document specifies the corresponding GMPLS extensions, to further integrate optical multi-granularity and benefit from the features of the corresponding switching layers.</t></abstract>
