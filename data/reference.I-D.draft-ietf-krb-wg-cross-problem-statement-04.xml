<abstract><t>As industrial automation is moving towards wider adoption of Internet standards, the Kerberos authentication protocol represents one of the best alternatives for ensuring the confidentiality and the integrity of communications in control networks while meeting performance and security requirements.  However, the use of Kerberos cross-realm operations in large scale industrial systems may introduce issues that could cause performance and reliability problems. This document describes some examples of actual large scale industrial systems, and lists requirements and restriction regarding authentication operations in such environments. The document then describes standing issues in the Kerberos cross- realm authentication model that should be fixed before Kerberos can be adopted in large scale industrial systems.</t></abstract>
