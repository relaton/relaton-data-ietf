<abstract><t>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and the Internet Standard Management Framework are widely used for the management of communication devices, creating a need to specify SNMP access (including access to SNMP MIB object instances) from non-SNMP management environments.  For example, when out-of-band IP management is used via a separate management interface (e.g., for a device that does not support in-band IP access), a uniform way to indicate how to contact the device for management is needed.  Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) fit this need well, as they allow a single text string to indicate a management access communication endpoint for a wide variety of IP-based protocols.</t><t>This document defines a URI scheme so that SNMP can be designated as the protocol used for management.  The scheme also allows a URI to designate one or more MIB object instances.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
