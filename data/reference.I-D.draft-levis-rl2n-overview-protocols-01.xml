<abstract><t>Networks of low power wireless devices introduce novel IP routing issues. Nodes (such as sensor, actuator or various forms of objects) are constrained in several ways: limited memory and processing power and so on. Furthermore, most of them are battery-powered thus making the use of energy efficient routing protocol of high importance. Wireless links can vary significantly over time, requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize the energy cost of topology changes. Thus such networks also referred to as L2Ns (Low Power and Lossy networks) have very specific routing requirements that are partially addressed by existing mesh routing protocols. The aim of this document is to provide a brief survey of the strengths and weaknesses of existing protocol with respect to these issues in order to provide guidance on how their lessons can be leveraged in future protocol design.</t></abstract>
