<abstract><t>TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) deter spoofing of connections and prevent resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder (server) state during the initial handshake.  The Initiator (client) has sole responsibility for ensuring required delays between connections.  The cookie exchange may carry data, limited to inhibit amplification and reflection denial of service attacks.  This document provides a sockets Application Program Interface (API) to support "basic" and "advanced" TCPCT applications.  TCP/IP applications written using the sockets API have enjoyed a high degree of portability.  Copyright Notice  Copyright (c) 2010 IETF Trust and the persons identified as the document authors.
