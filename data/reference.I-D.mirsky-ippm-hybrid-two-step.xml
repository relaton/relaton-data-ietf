<abstract><t>Development of, and advancements in, automation of network operations brought new requirements for measurement methodology.  Among them is the ability to collect instant network state as the packet being processed by the networking elements along its path through the domain.  This document introduces a new hybrid measurement method, referred to as hybrid two-step, as it separates the act of measuring and/or calculating the performance metric from the act of collecting and transporting network state.</t></abstract>
