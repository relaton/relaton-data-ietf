<abstract><t>This document defines a set of encryption transforms for use in the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and in the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocols, which are parts of the IP Security (IPsec) protocol suite. The transforms are based on the GOST R 34.12-2015 block ciphers (which are named &quot;Magma&quot; and &quot;Kuznyechik&quot;) in Multilinear Galois Mode (MGM) and the external rekeying approach. </t><t>This specification was developed to facilitate implementations that wish to support the GOST algorithms. This document does not imply IETF endorsement of the cryptographic algorithms used in this document.</t></abstract>
