<abstract><t>This document describes a two-rate, three-color marker that has been in use for data services including Frame Relay services.  This marker can be used for metering per-flow traffic in the emerging IP and L2 VPN services.  The marker defined here is different from previously defined markers in the handling of the in-profile traffic. Furthermore, this marker doesn't impose peak-rate shaping requirements on customer edge (CE) devices.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
