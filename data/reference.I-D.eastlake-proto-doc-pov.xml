<abstract><t>Two points of view are contrasted: the 'paper' point of view, where digital objects of interest are like pieces of paper, and the 'protocol' point of view where objects of interest are composite dynamic protocol messages. While each point of view has a place, adherence to a paper point of view is damaging to protocol design. By understanding both of these points of view, conflicts between them may be clarified and reduced.</t></abstract>
