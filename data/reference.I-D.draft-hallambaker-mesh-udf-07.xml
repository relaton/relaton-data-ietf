<abstract><t>This document describes the naming and addressing schemes used in the Mathematical Mesh.  The means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint (UDF) values and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs are described.  A UDF consists of a binary sequence, the initial eight bits of which specify a type identifier code.  Type identifier codes have been selected so as to provide a useful mnemonic indicating their purpose when presented in Base32 encoding.  Two categories of UDF are described.  Data UDFs provide a compact presentation of a fixed length binary data value in a format that is convenient for data entry.  A Data UDF may represent a cryptographic key, a nonce value or a share of a secret.  Fingerprint UDFs provide a compact presentation of a Message Digest or Message Authentication Code value.  A Strong Internet Name (SIN) consists of a DNS name which contains at least one label that is a UDF fingerprint of a policy document controlling interpretation of the name.  SINs allow a direct trust model to be applied to achieve end-to-end security in existing Internet applications without the need for trusted third parties.  UDFs may be presented as URIs to form either names or locators for use with the UDF location service.  An Encrypted Authenticated Resource Locator (EARL) is a UDF locator URI presenting a service from which an encrypted resource may be obtained and a symmetric key that may be used to decrypt the content.  EARLs may be presented on paper correspondence as a QR code to securely provide a machine- readable version of the same content.  This may be applied to automate processes such as invoicing or to provide accessibility services for the partially sighted.
