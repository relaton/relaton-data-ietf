<abstract><t>As the increment of network scale, optical networks have been partitioned into multi-layer and multi-domain networks for the purpose of better management.  Meanwhile, as the variety of user requests, different LSPs have been established in order to meet different requirements of users.  As a consequence, in multi-layer and multi-domain networks, the LSP establishment performance is necessary to be measured so as to meet user requirements better.  For this reason, typical performance measurement metrics need to be proposed.  In this document, the LSP establishment delay and bit error ratio (BER) are illustrated, and the definition and methodologies are proposed.</t></abstract>
