<abstract><t>Protection and recovery are important features of service provision in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. Increasingly, MPLS and GMPLS networking is being widened from single domain scope to operate in multi-domain environments.  Various schemes and processes have been developed to establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain environments. These are discussed in RFC 4726: A Framework for Inter-Domain Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering.  This document analyzes the application of these techniques to protection and recovery in multi-domain networks. The main focus for this document is on establishing end-to-end diverse Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs in multi-domain networks.  Takeda et al.
