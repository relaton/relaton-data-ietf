<abstract><t>This memo describes a proposed authentication protocol for verifying the    identity of a user of a TCP connection.  Given a TCP port number pair,    it returns a character string which identifies the owner of that    connection on the server's system.  Suggested uses include automatic    identification and verification of a user during an FTP session,    additional verification of a TAC dial up user, and access verification    for a generalized network file server.</t></abstract>
