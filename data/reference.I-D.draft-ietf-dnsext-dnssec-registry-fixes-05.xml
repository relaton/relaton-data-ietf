<abstract><t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) has an IANA registry to allocate cryptographic algorithm suites for use in generating digital signatures over DNS data.  Newly introduced cryptographic algorithms to DNSSEC mean implementors need to know which algorithms need to be implemented, which are optional, and which are obsolete.  This document adds a column to the IANA registry table for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers which lists their current status for use.</t></abstract>
