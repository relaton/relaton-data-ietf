<abstract><t>Congestion control is needed for all data transported across the Internet, in order to promote fair usage and prevent congestion collapse.  The requirements for interactive, point-to-point real time multimedia, which needs low-delay, semi-reliable data delivery, are different from the requirements for bulk transfer like FTP or bursty transfers like Web pages.  This document attempts to describe a set of requirements that can be used to evaluate other congestion control mechanisms in order to figure out their fitness for this purpose, and in particular to provide a set of possible requirements for proposals coming out of the RMCAT Working Group.</t></abstract>
