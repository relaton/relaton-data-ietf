<abstract><t>This I-D is to analyze the gaps in the ongoing work of the QoS application in the DIME WG, discuss the extension of the scope of QoS application to a generic resource control application for a variety of network technologies and use cases, and investigate potential mechanisms to support additional resource control scenarios. The current Diameter Quality of Service Application (draft-tschofenig- dime-diameter-qos-01.txt) is limited to an environment where network elements triggered by certain mechanisms (e.g. path-coupled QoS signaling such as RSVP or NSIS initiated by end-hosts) can request QoS authorization of network resources. It does not address environments where end-hosts and/or network elements is unable to issue a resource request initiatively. In such environments, a different mode of operations is needed to allow an authorizing entity to not just authorize QoS resources upon the receipt of the request from network elements but also directly authorize resources and dictate routers/switches to enforce the decisions without the request from network elements. The new mode of operations also lends itself to address resource control in general. It can control resources for the purpose beyond QoS support, such as NAPT, media latching, and packet filtering.</t></abstract>
