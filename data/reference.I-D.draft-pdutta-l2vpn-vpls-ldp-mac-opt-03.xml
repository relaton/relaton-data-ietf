<abstract><t>[RFC4762] describes a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses which have been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster convergence on topology change. The procedure also removes the MAC  addresses in the VPLS which does not require relearning due to such topology change. This document defines an extension to MAC Address Withdrawal procedure with empty MAC List [RFC4762], that enables a Provider Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses that needs  to be relearned.  Conventions used in this document  In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively.</t></abstract>
