<abstract><t>This document describes the methodology for the benchmarking of devices that implement traffic control based on IP precedence or diff-serv code point criteria. The methodology is to be applied to measurements made on the data plane to evaluate the performance of the traffic control mechanisms. The methodology permits the specific traffic control mechanisms and configuration commands to vary between DUTs. The methodology uses much of the Terminology defined in [Pp06].</t></abstract>
