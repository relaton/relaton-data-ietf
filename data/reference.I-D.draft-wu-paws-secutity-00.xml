<abstract><t>PAWS is an access protocol between the Master device and the White Space(WS) Database.  Master Devices connect to the white space database directly using WS interface,but only authorized devices can get the service from database.If an attacker can have full access to the network medium between the master device and the database, the attacker may deploy varieties of attacks on the network if there is lack of security mechanism.  The present document describes the security threats to the current framework of PAWS, and meanwhile proposes the corresponding countermeasures.</t></abstract>
