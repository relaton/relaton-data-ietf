<abstract><t>[RFC2460] defines an IPv6 extension header called "Routing Header", identified by a Next Header value of 43 in the immediately preceding header. A particular Routing Header subtype denoted as "Type 0" is also defined. Type 0 Routing Headers are referred to as "RH0" in this document. Use of RH0 has been shown to have unpleasant security implications. Many of these attacks are caused by loops in the routing header. This document lists checks which need to be done in the intermediate routers in order to prevent such routing loops in the Routing Header</t></abstract>
