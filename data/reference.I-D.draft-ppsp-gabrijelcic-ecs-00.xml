<abstract><t>The Enhanced Closed Swarm (ECS) protocol is a distributed access control mechanism suitable for usage in Peer-to-Peer content delivery systems.  The protocol provides coarse or fine grained authorization of peers participating in content distribution.  As a result, only authorized peers are allowed to communicate in a swarm.  The protocol also provides data confidentiality, integrity and origin authentication for application data exchanged among peers.  The protocol is simple but flexible enough to enable a range of usage scenarios.  In addition to the ECS protocol, this document also describes its application in the IETF PPSPP.</t></abstract>
