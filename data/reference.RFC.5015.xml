<abstract><t>This document discusses Bidirectional PIM (BIDIR-PIM), a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that builds bidirectional shared trees connecting multicast sources and receivers.  Bidirectional trees are built using a fail-safe Designated Forwarder (DF) election mechanism operating on each link of a multicast topology.  With the assistance of the DF, multicast data is natively forwarded from sources to the Rendezvous-Point (RP) and hence along the shared tree to receivers without requiring source-specific state.  The DF election takes place at RP discovery time and provides the route to the RP, thus eliminating the requirement for data-driven protocol events.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
