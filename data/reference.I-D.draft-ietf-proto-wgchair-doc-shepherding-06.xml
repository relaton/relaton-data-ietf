<abstract><t>The methodologies described in this document have been designed to improve and facilitate IETF document flow processing. A set of procedures, known as the PROTO process (because it was created by the PROcess and TOols or PROTO team), are specified in which a working group chair serves as the primary document shepherd for a document which has been submitted to the IESG for publication. Note that this role has traditionally been filled by the AD responsible for the working group.</t></abstract>
