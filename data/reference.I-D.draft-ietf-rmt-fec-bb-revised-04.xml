<abstract><t>This document describes how to use Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to efficiently provide and/or augment reliability for data transport. This document defines a framework for the definition of the information that needs to be communicated in order to use an FEC code for delivering content, in addition to the encoded data itself, and for definition of formats and codes for communcation of that information. Both information communicated with the encoded data itself and information that needs to be communicated 'out-of-band' are considered. The procedures for specifying new FEC codes, defining the information communication requirements associated with those codes and registering them with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) are also described. The requirements on Content Delivery Protocols which wish to use FEC codes defined within this framework are also defined. The companion document titled, "The Use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) in Reliable Multicast" describes some applications of FEC codes for delivering content.</t></abstract>
