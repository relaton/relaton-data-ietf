<abstract><t>Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) is an advanced version of shortest path algorithms used in OSPF and IS-IS route computations. It is used in computing shortest path for label-switched paths (LSPs) based upon multiple constraints. While computing path for LSPs it considers topology of network, attributes of LSP and links. The path is computed using traffic engineering database which takes the extensions of OSPF(open shortest path first) and IS-IS (Intermediate system to Intermediate system) as input.</t></abstract>
