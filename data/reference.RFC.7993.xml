<abstract><t>The HTML format for RFCs assigns style guidance to a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) specifically defined for the RFC Series.  The embedded, default CSS as included by the RFC Editor is expected to take into account accessibility needs and to be built along a responsive design model.  This document describes the requirements for the default CSS used by the RFC Editor.  The class names are based on the classes defined in &quot;HTML for RFCs&quot; (RFC 7992).</t></abstract>
