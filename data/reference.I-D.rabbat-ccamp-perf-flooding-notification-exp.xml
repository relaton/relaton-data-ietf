<abstract><t>This memo presents the observations and results obtained from two test-beds designed to study and evaluate the performance and feasibility of rapid fault notification via flooding. Flooding-based fault notification [2,3] is an alternative to signaling-only notification approaches, which has the advantages of: scalability and the ability to meet bounded recovery-time constraints, if needed. We implemented flooding-based notification at both the transport and packet layers. For optical transport networks the flooding mechanism (e.g. [3]), was realized using enhancements to the Link Management Protocol (LMP), while for packet/MPLS networks the flooding was realized using enhancements to Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). We present experiences and performance measurements from these implementations on FreeBSD/Linux platforms, and also present the protocol enhancements that were made to LMP and OSPF, respectively, to realize the rapid flooding function.</t></abstract>
