<abstract><t>When multiple Mobile Routers share the same prefix, a Home Agent must be able to verify whether the Mobile Routers share the same Mobile Network or not. Otherwise, the Home Agent may not be able to forward a data packet to a correct recipient since the recipient may not be connected to the mobile router the Home Agent chooses to forward the packet. This document describes a Token based Duplicate Network Detection mechanism that enables a Home Agent to detect whether multiple Mobile Rotuers claiming the same prefix are in the same Mobile Network.</t></abstract>
