<abstract><t>This document provides a problem statement for the proposed Path Computation Element (PCE). The PCE is an approach to MPLS traffic engineering path computation that is particularly applicable in inter-domain environments. In this context, a domain may be an IGP area, an Autonomous System, or some other division of computational responsibility. An overview of solution alternatives and proposed PCE work group charter is also provided.</t></abstract>
