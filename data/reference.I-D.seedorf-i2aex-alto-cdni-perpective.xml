<abstract><t>Recently, there has been a discussion on "Infrastructure-to- Application Information Exposure" and the related communications requirements in fully controlled (e.g. data centers) or partially controlled environments (e.g.  CDN).  One possibility to expose infrastructure information to applications in the aforementioned environments is to use yet-to-be-defined ALTO extensions.  This draft discusses requirements for such ALTO extensions for a specific use case: Request Routing in CDN Interconnection (CDNI).</t></abstract>
