<abstract><t>Presence-based location objects used by Internet protocols encode bindings of location information to identities of a presentity, with associated rules for the handling and usage of the location object. Parties that make use of location objects rely on the accuracy of these bindings to ensure their proper function, and the entities that they describe rely on the proper application of the included rules to ensure their privacy. This document describes the space of attacks against location objects.</t></abstract>
