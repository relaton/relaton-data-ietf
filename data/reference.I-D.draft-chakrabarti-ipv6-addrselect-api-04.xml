<abstract><t>The IPv6 default address selection document [RFC3484] describes the rules for selecting source and destination IPv6 addresses, and indicates that applications should be able to reverse the sense of some of the address selection rules through some unspecified API. However, no such socket API exists in the basic [RFC3493] or advanced [RFC3542] IPv6 socket API documents. This document fills that gap by specifying new socket level options and flags for the getaddrinfo() API to specify preferences for address selection that modify the default address selection algorithm. The socket API described in this document will be particularly useful for IPv6 applications that want to choose between temporary and public addresses, and for Mobile IPv6 aware applications that want to use the care-of address for communication.</t></abstract>
