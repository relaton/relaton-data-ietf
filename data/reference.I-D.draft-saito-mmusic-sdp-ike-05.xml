<abstract><t>This document specifies how to establish secure media sessions over VPN using SIP for the purpose of on-demand media/application sharing between peers.  It extends the protocol identifier of SDP so that it could negotiate the use of IKE for media session in SDP offer/answer model.  And it also specifies the method to boot up IKE and generate IPsec SA using self-signed certificate under the mechanism of comedia-tls.  This document extends RFC 4572.  In addition, it defines a new attribute "udp-setup", which is similar to "setup" attribute defined in RFC 4145, to enable endpoints to negotiate their roles in the IKE session.  Considering the case that pre-shared keys can be used for authentication in IKE, a new attribute "psk- fingerprint" is also defined.  The spec in this document would be applicable to the following use- cases:  o  Media sharing using DLNA or similar protocol over VPN between 2  users' devices  o  Remote desktop sharing for customer services over VPN initiated by  SIP call  As an additional function of Click to Call, a customer service  agent can access customer's pc remotely to troubleshoot the  problem while talking with the customer over the phone.  o  Accessing and controlling medical equipments(medical robotics)  remotely to monitor elders in a rural area (remote care services)  o  LAN based gaming protocol based on peer to peer rather than via  gaming server</t></abstract>
