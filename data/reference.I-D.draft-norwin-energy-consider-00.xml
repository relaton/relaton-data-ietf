<abstract><t>With rising cost and an increasing awareness of the environmental impact of energy consumption, a desirable feature of networked devices is to be able to assess their power state and energy consumption at will.  With this data available, one can build sophisticated applications such as monitoring applications or even active energy management systems.  These systems themselves are out of scope of this memo, as it discusses only considerations for the monitored devices.  Implementation specifics such as the definition of a Management Information Base are also outside the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
