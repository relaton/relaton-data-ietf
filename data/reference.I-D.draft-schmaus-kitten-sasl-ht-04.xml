<abstract><t>This document specifies the family of Hashed Token SASL mechanisms, which are meant to be used for quick re-authentication of a previous session.  The Hashed Token SASL mechanism's authentication sequence consists of only one round-trip.  This is achieved by the usage of short-lived, exclusively ephemeral hashed tokens.  It further provides hash agility, mutual authentication and is secured by channel binding.</t></abstract>
