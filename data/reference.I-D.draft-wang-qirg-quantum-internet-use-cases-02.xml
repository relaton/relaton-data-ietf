<abstract><t>The Quantum Internet has the potential to improve Internet protocol and application functionality by incorporating quantum information technology into the infrastructure of the overall Internet.  In this document, we provide an overview of some applications expected to be used on the Quantum Internet, and then categorize them using the standard telecommunications classification of control plane versus data plane functionality.  Other classification schemes are also possible and discussed briefly.  We then provide detailed use cases for selected applications.  The intent of this document is to provide a common understanding and framework of applications and use cases for the Quantum Internet.</t></abstract>
