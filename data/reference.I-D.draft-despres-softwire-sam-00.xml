<abstract><t>Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) is a generic mechanism which permits, in a number of new scenarios, to easily establish tunnels for packets of some address family to traverse domains where this family is not directly routed (softwires).  It generalizes address mapping principles of already deployed technologies such as 6to4, ISATAP, and 6rd, where encapsulations of IP over IP are used for point-to- multipoint tunnels (mesh softwires).  Identified use cases of SAM include native IPv6 across IPv4 NATs, IPv6 multihoming with provider-aggregatable prefixes, public IPv4 across IPv6-only domains and, to mitigate consequences of the IPv4 address shortage, extended IPv4 prefixes for statically shared IPv4 public addresses.</t></abstract>
