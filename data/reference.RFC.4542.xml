<abstract><t>RFCs 3689 and 3690 detail requirements for an Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS), of which an Internet Emergency Preparedness Service (IEPS) would be a part.  Some of these types of services require call preemption; others require call queuing or other mechanisms.  IEPS requires a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure and a Per Hop Behavior (PHB) for the data that meet the needs of this architecture.  Such a CAC procedure and PHB is appropriate to any service that might use H.323 or SIP to set up real-time sessions.  The key requirement is to guarantee an elevated probability of call completion to an authorized user in time of crisis.</t><t>This document primarily discusses supporting ETS in the context of the US Government and NATO, because it focuses on the Multi-Level Precedence and Preemption (MLPP) and Government Emergency Telecommunication Service (GETS) standards.  The architectures described here are applicable beyond these organizations.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
