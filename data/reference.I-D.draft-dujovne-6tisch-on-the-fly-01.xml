<abstract><t>This document describes the environment, problem statement, and goals of On-The-Fly (OTF) scheduling for the IEEE802.15.4e TSCH MAC protocol in the context of LLNs.  The purpose of OTF is to dynamically adapt the number of reserved Softcells between neighbor nodes to satisfy different types of constraints, based on the specific application.  The Softcell reservation with OTF is distributed: neighbor nodes negotiate the cell(s) to be (re)allocated /deleted among them, without the intervention of a centralized entity.  This document aims to define a module which uses the functionalities provided by the 6top sublayer to extract statistics and to reserve/delete Softcells in the schedule, leaving the reservation/deletion algorithm, and the number and type of statistics to be used in the algorithm itself, open.  OTF allows to reserve/ delete either a single Softcell between a couple of nodes, or a Bundle in the TSCH schedule.  Also, OTF allows to negotiate the aggregate bandwidth without explicitly dealing with a reservation of a specific subset of Softcells.</t></abstract>
