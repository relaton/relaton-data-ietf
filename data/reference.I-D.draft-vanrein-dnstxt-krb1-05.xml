<abstract><t>This specification defines a method to determine Kerberos realm names for services that are known by their DNS name.  Currently, such information can only be found in static mappings or through educated guesswork.  DNS can make this process more flexible, provided that DNSSEC is used to ensure authenticity of resource records.</t></abstract>
