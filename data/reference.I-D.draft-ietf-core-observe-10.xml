<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over time.  This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP that enables CoAP clients to "observe" resources, i.e., to retrieve a representation of a resource and keep this representation updated by the server over a period of time.  The protocol follows a best- effort approach for sending new representations to clients and provides eventual consistency between the state observed by each client and the actual resource state at the server.</t></abstract>
