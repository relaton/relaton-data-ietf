<abstract><t>For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet universal, and because an international standard for the internet community should be documented and stable, this I-D has been released with the intention of producing an RFC to document the character use and naming conventions of the SignWriting community on the Internet.  The SignWriting Script is an international standard for writing sign languages by hand or with computers.  From education to research, from entertainment to religion, SignWriting has proven useful because people are using it to write signed languages.  The SignWriting Script has two major families: Block Printing for the reader and Handwriting for the writer.  The script encoding model presented in this document evolved from the Block Printing half of the SignWriting Script.  The SignWriting Text encoding model encompasses the Block Printing family of the SignWriting Script.  The plain text model for the mathematical names has been stable since January 12th, 2012.  The visual image can be SVG generated on the server or created with an experimental TrueType Font.  The coded character sets and character encoding forms are documented with regular expressions.  The ad hoc graphemes of informal SignWriting were first created in 1974.  Ad hoc graphemes are still used in the handwriting family. The standardized symbols of computerized Block Printing text began in 1986.  After several generations of writers and standardized symbolsets, the ISWA 2010 has been optimized and refined as a 16-bit coded character set with several isomorphic encodings based on an ordered hierarchy with 6 degrees of significance.  The International SignWriting Alphabet 2010 is a mathematical symbolset that has been stable since its initial release on May 11th, 2010.  The SignPuddle Standard for SignWriting Text is an open and freely available encoding model for sign language as text.  The licenses include the Open Font License for the fonts, Creative Commons by-sa (Attribution, Share Alike) for the documentation, and the GPL for the software implementation.  The technological infrastructure continues to expand and should be fully realized by the time this I-D has become an RFC.  SignPuddle Online contains almost 1 million examples of 2-dimensional signs written by the internet community.  Each logogram has a mathematical name which describes the freeform placement of the symbols.  These strings are the written record of the sign.  This standard and emerging infrastructure are used for the sign language Wikipedia project on Wikimedia Labs.  This standard is being integrated with the SignTyp linguistic coding system developed by Rachel Channon through an NSF grant.  This standard was the origin for the alternate Unicode proposals.  For Unicode, the current use of the Private Use Area font characters is documented.  The state of the TrueType Font is explained.  A character proposal for plane 1 is included that is isomorphic with the characters that are currently used by the community.  Three appendices discuss additional topics to the standard.  The first discusses the Modern SignWriting theory and example document, stable since January 12, 2012.  The second discusses the founding principles of Cartesian SignWriting: a script encoding model for SignWriting Block Printing.  The third discusses a common framework for written sign language grammar.  This memo concretely defines a conceptual character encoding map for the Internet community.  It is published for reference, examination, implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</t></abstract>
