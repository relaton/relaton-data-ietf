<abstract><t>In 2006, two experiments were started for email authentication: Sender Policy Framework (SPF, RFC 4408 [RFC4408]) and Sender ID (RFC 4406 [RFC4406], supported by RFCs 4405 [RFC4405] and 4407 [RFC4407]). After eight years of experimental data (RFC 6686 [RFC6686]), it was clear that SPF remained in widespread use while Sender ID did not. RFC 7208 [RFC7208] moved SPF from Experimental status to Proposed Standard.  This document acknowledges that Sender ID did not pass its experiment, and changes the status of RFCs 4405 [RFC4405], 4406 [RFC4406], and 4407 [RFC4407] to Historic.</t></abstract>
