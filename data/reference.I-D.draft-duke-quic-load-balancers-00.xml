<abstract><t>QUIC connection IDs allow continuation of connections across address/port 5-tuple changes, and can store routing information for stateless or low-state layer 4 load balancers.  They are also meant to prevent linkability of connections across deliberate address migration through the use of protected communications between client and server. This creates issues for load-balancing intermediaries. This specification standardizes the communication between load balancers and servers to overcome these issues in a protocol called QUIC-LB.</t></abstract>
