<abstract><t>This document specifies the process that Certification Authorities (CAs) and Relying Parties (RPs) participating in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new (and probably cryptographically stronger) algorithm set.  The process is expected to be completed over a timescale of several years. Consequently, no emergency transition is specified.  The transition procedure defined in this document supports only a top-down migration (parent migrates before children).</t></abstract>
