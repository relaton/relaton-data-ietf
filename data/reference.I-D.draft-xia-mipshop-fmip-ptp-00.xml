<abstract><t>FMIPv6 standard currently assumes that the mobile nodes are connected to the access routers using a shared link and does not define the operation over Point-to-Point links. In this document we define FMIPv6 operation over the Point-to-Point links. A PAR advertises PrRtAdv including one or more aggregate prefixes of a NAR to an MN; The MN formulates it's provisional NCoAs with the aggregate prefix(es); The MN initiates FMIPv6 procedure including the provisional NCoAs. Once detecting provisional NCoAs of the MN, the NAR assigns a unique prefix called the dedicated prefix to MN and the MN configures it's final NCoAs. Both reactive and predictive modes of FMIPv6 are explained.</t></abstract>
