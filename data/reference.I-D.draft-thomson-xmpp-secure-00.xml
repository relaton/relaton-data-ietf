<abstract><t>The history of secure messaging in XMPP is spotty.  The long-running de facto scheme, OTR, enjoys fairly wide implementation and use, but OTR suffers from some serious usability and security shortcomings that make it unsuitable as a basis for encryption.  This document describes an architecture that provides end-to-end confidentiality and integrity for XMPP messaging.  Solutions for both multi-user and one-to-one messaging are provided.</t></abstract>
