<abstract><t>As defined in I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn, enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support the needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay network.  A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which consists of a subset of network topology and network resources allocated from the underlay network.  A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services.  I-D.dong-lsr-sr-enhanced-vpn defines the IGP mechanisms with necessary extensions to build a set of Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs.  This document describes a simplified mechanism to build the SR based VTNs using SR Flex-Algo together with minor extensions to IGP L2 bundle.</t></abstract>
