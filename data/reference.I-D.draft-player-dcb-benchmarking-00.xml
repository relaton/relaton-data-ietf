<abstract><t>Existing benchmarking methodologies are based on the assumption that networking devices will drop network traffic at their performance limits.  Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices, however, will attempt to throttle network endpoints before those limits are reached in order to minimize the probability of frame loss in the network.  Hence, existing methodologies based around frame loss are inappropriate for DCB devices.  This document takes the basic benchmarking ideas based on loss and extends them to support "lossless" Ethernet devices.</t></abstract>
