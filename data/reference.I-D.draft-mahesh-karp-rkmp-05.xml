<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism to secure the routing protocols which use unicast to transport their signaling messages.  Most of such routing protocols are TCP-based (e.g., BGP and LDP), and the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) is primarily employed for securing the signaling messages of these routing protocols.  There are also two exceptions: BFD which is over UDP or MPLS, and RSVP-TE which is over IP (but employs an integrated approach to protecting the signaling messages instead of using IPsec).  The proposed mechanism secures pairwise TCP-based Routing Protocol (RP) associations, BFD associations and RSVP-TE associations using the IKEv2 Key Management Protocol (KMP) integrated with TCP-AO, BFD, and RSVP-TE respectively. Included are extensions to IKEv2 and its Security Associations to enable its key negotiation to support TCP-AO, BFD, and RSVP-TE.</t></abstract>
