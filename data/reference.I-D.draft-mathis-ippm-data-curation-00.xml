<abstract><t>This document describes the nomenclature, requirements and framework for handling per-sample metadata for a live archive of Internet measurements.  By archive, we mean that once captured, the data MUST NOT be altered or deleted.  By live, we mean that new data from ongoing measurements are being continuously appended to the archive.  The purpose of the metadata is to support the use of the Scientific Method in the study the archived data.  Under the principle of full disclosure, the Scientific Method requires that later researchers be able to repeat earlier studies using the original data, but refined by new insights (such as improved calibration) gained from other intervening studies.</t></abstract>
