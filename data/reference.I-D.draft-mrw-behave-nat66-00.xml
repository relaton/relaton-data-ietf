<abstract><t>This document describes a stateless, transport-agnostic IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT66) function that provides the address independence benefit associated with IPv4-to-IPv4 NAT (NAT44) while minimizing, but not completely eliminating, the problems associated with NAT44.  This document also describes an address mapping option for NAT66 that offers the topology hiding benefit associated with NAT44 at the cost of additional state in the NAT66 device.</t></abstract>
