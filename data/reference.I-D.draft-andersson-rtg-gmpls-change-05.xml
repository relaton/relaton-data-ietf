<abstract><t>The issues surrounding the extensibility of IETF protocols have been widely debated. These issues include when it is reasonable to extend IETF protocols with little or no review, and when extensions or variations need to be reviewed by the larger IETF community. Experience with IETF protocols has shown that extensibility of protocols without early IETF review can cause problems. The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suites of protocols have become popular for a number of applications and deployment scenarios. One result of this popularity is a large number of suggestions for modifications and extensions.</t></abstract>
