<abstract><t>This document describes implications of applying end-to-end encryption at the transport layer.  It identifies some in-network uses of transport layer header information that can be used with a transport header integrity check.  It reviews the implication of developing encrypted end-to-end transport protocols and examines the implication of developing and deploying encrypted end-to-end transport protocols.  Since transport measurement and analysis of the impact of network characteristics have been important to the design of current transport protocols, it also considers some anticipated implications on transport and application evolution.</t></abstract>
