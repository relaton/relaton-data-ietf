<abstract><t>This document aims to highlight implementation results on network discovery as well as some new ideas for its extension. The implementation is based on the draft on mediating network discovery, a mechanism that enables a mobile node to discover roaming partners of an access network via EAP. The concept allows automatic network selection of end hosts, based on additional parameters, hence reducing interacting with the user.This document should also open a discussion on the need on network capability mechanisms.</t></abstract>
