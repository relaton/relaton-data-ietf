<abstract><t>This document defines an IPv6 Geographic global unicast address format for use in the Internet.  The address format defined in this document is consistent with the IPv6 Protocol [1] and the "IPv6 Addressing Architecture" [2].  It is designed to facilitate scalable Internet routing when sites attach to multiple service providers, by using a prefix based on a geographic reference to the site. A natural byproduct of this address allocation mechanism is that all addresses are fixed allowing sites to change providers at will without requiring their network to renumber.</t></abstract>
