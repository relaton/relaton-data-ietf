<abstract><t>Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and being managed. To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is necessary that the router be tested in these simultaneous operational conditions, which is known as Stress Testing. This document provides the Methodology for performing Stress Benchmarking of networking devices when subjected to instability as described in [7]. Descriptions of test topology, benchmarks and reporting format are provided in addition to procedures for conducting various test cases. This methodology is based upon the accelerated stress methodology guidelines [6] and is to be used with the companion terminology document [4].</t></abstract>
