<abstract><t>This document describes two methods for producing an integrity check value from a Diffie-Hellman key pair and one method for producing an integrity check value from an Elliptic Curve key pair.  This behavior is needed for such operations as creating the signature of a PKCS #10 certification request.  These algorithms are designed to provide a proof-of-possession rather than general purpose signing.  This document obsoletes RFC 2875.</t></abstract>
