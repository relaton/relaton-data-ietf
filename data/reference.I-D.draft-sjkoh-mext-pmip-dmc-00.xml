<abstract><t>Mobile cellular networks with hierarchical architecture are now changing to flat architecture due to ever-increasing mobile Internet traffics. Most of the existing mobility protocols are based on a centralized mobility anchor, by which all the control and data traffics are processed. In the flat network architecture, however, the centralized mobility scheme has some limitations, which include unwanted traffic flowing into core network, service degradation by a single point of failure, and increased operational costs, etc. This draft proposes some mobility schemes for distributed mobility control in the flat architecture of future network. Based on the well-known Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIP), we propose the three schemes of distributed mobility control: Signal-driven PMIP (S-PMIP), Data- driven Distributed PMIP (DD-PMIP), and Signal-driven Distributed PMIP (SD-PMIP). This draft proposes an extension of PMIP for distributed mobility control.</t></abstract>
