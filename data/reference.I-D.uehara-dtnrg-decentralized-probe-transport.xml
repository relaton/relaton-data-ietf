<abstract><t>(This document is a description of the decentralized viechle to viechle probe mechanism currently being prototyped.  The main purpose of disclosing this -00 document is to introduce the application idea and start discussion within the DTNRG.  Because of this, the current mechanism described in this docment does not conform to the protocols defined in the DTNRG at this moment.  The mechanism should be updated based on the discussion in this group.)  This document describes the transport protocol specification used for the decentralized probe system for vehicles.  The probe system exchanges probe messages between vehicles using a wireless communication methods with low bandwidth and lossy properties.  The communication environment dynamically changes as vehicle moves.  The protocol try to utilize the limited bandwidth as much as possible and increase reachability rate by using sender-side error correction mechanism.</t></abstract>
