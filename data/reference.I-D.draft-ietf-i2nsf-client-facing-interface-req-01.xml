<abstract><t>This document captures requirements for Client-Facing interface to Security Controller.  The interface is expressed using objects and constructs understood by Security Admin as opposed to vendor or device specific expressions associated with individual product and feature.  This document identifies a broad set of requirements needed to express security policies based on User-constructs which are well understood by User Community.  This gives ability to decouple policy definition from policy enforcement on a specific element, be it a physical or virtual.</t></abstract>
