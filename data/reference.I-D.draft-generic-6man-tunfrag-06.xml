<abstract><t>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.  Instead, links with restricting MTUs must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation and reassembly (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below IPv6.  This latter category of links is often performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link adaptation.  A common case that exhibits these link characteristics is seen for IPv6-within-IP tunnels.  Additionally, IPv6 nodes can avoid path MTU discovery issues even when no link adaptation is necessary by performing a small amount of fragmentation and/or by probing the path as necessary.  This document therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better accommodate path MTU issues.</t></abstract>
