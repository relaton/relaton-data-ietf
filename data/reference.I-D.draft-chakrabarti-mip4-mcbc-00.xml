<abstract><t>The IP Mobility Protocol [RFC3344] describes the multicast and broadcast packet transmission between the mobile node and the home- network or visited network. The Reverse Tunneling for Mobile IP, Revised [RFC3024] describes reverse tunneling the multicast and broadcast packets to the home network using encapsulating delivery style between mobile nodes and the foreign agent. However, [RFC3024] says that all packets must be encapsulated in the IP-in-IP tunnel once the encapsulated delivery style is negotiated. This restriction causes over-the-air tunnel overhead in the wireless medium between the mobile and the foreign agent. This document provides a generic solution to ease the restriction of unicast packet to be encapsulated in encapsulating delivery mode. It also provides alternatives of direct delivery of multicast/broadcast packets between a foreign agent and a mobile node in point-to-point link such as Wimax network.</t></abstract>
