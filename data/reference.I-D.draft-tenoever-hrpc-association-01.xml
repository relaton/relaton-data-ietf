<abstract><t>This document aims to scope the relation between Internet protocols and the rights to freedom of assembly and association.  The Internet increasingly mediates our lives and our ability to excercise human rights.  Since Internet protocols play a central role in the management, development and use of the Internet, the relation between the mentioned rights should be documented and adverse impacts should be mitigated.  As there have been methods of protest on the Internet -a form of freedom of assembly- that have proven to be harmful to connectivity and infrastructure, such as DDoS attacks, this text aims to document forms of protest, association and assembly that do not have a negative impact on the Internet infrastructure.</t></abstract>
