<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments".  A segment can represent topological or service based instructions.  A segment can further be associated with network resources allocated for executing the instruction.  Such a segment is called resource-aware SID.  The resource-aware SIDs can be used to build SR paths with a set of reserved network resources.  In addition, the resource-aware SIDs can be used to build SR based virtual networks, which can provide the customized network topology and resource attributes required by different customers or services.  Such virtual networks are called SR based Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs).  The SR based VTNs can be used to enable the enhanced VPN (VPN+) services.  This document describes the mechanisms of using resource-aware SIDs to build SR based VTNs.</t></abstract>
