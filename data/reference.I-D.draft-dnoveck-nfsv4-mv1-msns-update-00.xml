<abstract><t>This document presents clarifications and corrections concerning features related to the use of location-related attributes in NFSv4.1.  These include migration, which transfers responsibility for a file system from one server to another, and trunking which deals with the discovery and control of the set of network addresses to use to access a file system.  The goal is to arrive at an appropriate set of updates to RFC5661.</t></abstract>
