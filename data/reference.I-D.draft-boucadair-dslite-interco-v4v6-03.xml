<abstract><t>This document describes a proposal to enhance dual-stack lite solution with an additional feature to ease interconnection between IPv4 and IPv6 realms.  When deployed, no 'dual-stack'-enabled network is required for the delivery of both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services to customers.  IPv6 transfer capabilities are used for the transfer of IPv4-addressed packets in a completely stateless scheme between the interconnection nodes and the dual-stack lite AFTR node(s).  The proposed dual-stack lite extension is meant to encourage (if not accelerate) IPv6 deployment in networks.</t></abstract>
