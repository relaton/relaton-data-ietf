<abstract><t>This draft discusses the issues associated with mobility management for dual stack mobile nodes. Currently, two mobility management protocols are defined for IPv4 and IPv6. Deploying both in a dual stack mobile node introduces a number of inefficiencies. Deployment and operational issues motivate the use of a single mobility management protocol. This draft discusses such motivations. The draft also hints on how the current [MIPv4] and [MIPv6] protocols could be extended so that they can support mobility management for a dual stack node.</t></abstract>
