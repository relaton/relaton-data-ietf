<abstract><t>The link quality mechanism of the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) enables "ignoring" some 1-hop neighbors if the measured link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable threshold, while still retaining the corresponding link information as acquired from HELLO message exchange.  This allows immediate reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently.  NHDP also collects information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors. However it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor ceases being symmetric, including while "ignored" as described above, then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed.  This may lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being permanently removed (until further HELLO messages are received) if the link quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold, even if only for a moment.  This specification updates RFC6130 "Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)", and RFC7181 "The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)" to permit retaining, but ignoring, symmetric 2-hop information when the link quality from the corresponding 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold.  This allows immediate reinstatement of the symmetric 2-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently, thus making the symmetric 2-hop neighborhood more "robust".</t></abstract>
