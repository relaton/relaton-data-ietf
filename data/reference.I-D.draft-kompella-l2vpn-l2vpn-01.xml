<abstract><t>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) based on Frame Relay or ATM circuits have been around a long time. While these VPNs work well, the costs of maintaining separate networks for Internet traffic and VPNs and the administrative burden of provisioning these VPNs have led Service Providers to look for alternative solutions. In this document, we present a VPN solution where from the customer's point of view, the VPN is based on Layer 2 circuits, but the Service Provider maintains and manages a single network for IP, IP VPNs, and Layer 2 VPNs.</t></abstract>
