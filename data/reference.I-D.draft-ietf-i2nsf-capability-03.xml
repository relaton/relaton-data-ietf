<abstract><t>This draft defines the concept of an NSF (Network Security Function) capability, as well as its information model. Capabilities are a set of features that are available from a managed entity, and are represented as data that unambiguously characterizes an NSF. Capabilities enable management entities to determine the set of features from available NSFs that will be used, and simplify the management of NSFs.</t></abstract>
