<abstract><t>SDP has been extended with a capability negotiation mechanism framework that allows the endpoints to negotiate transport protocols and attributes.  This framework has been extended with a media capabilities negotiation mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate additional media-related capabilities.  This negotiation is embedded into the widely-used SDP offer/answer procedures.  This memo extends the SDP capability negotiation framework to allow endpoints to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities.  In particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth ('b=' line), connection data ('c=' line), and titles ('i=' line for each session or media).</t></abstract>
