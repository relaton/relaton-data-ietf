<abstract><t>The extensibility of Internet protocols is a key factor to their success.  Yet, their implementations are often not designed with agility in mind.  In this document, we leverage the features of the QUIC protocol and propose a solution to dynamically extend QUIC implementations.  Our solution relies on QUIC Plugins that allow tuning and extending the QUIC protocol on a per-connection basis. These platform-independent plugins are executed inside a sandboxed environment which can be included in QUIC implementations.  We describe how such plugins can be used in different use cases.  This document is a straw-man proposal.  It aims at sparking discussions on the proposed approach.</t></abstract>
