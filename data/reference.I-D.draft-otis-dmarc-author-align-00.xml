<abstract><t>Deals with DMARC acceptance failures disrupting legitimate and valid message distribution affecting millions while attempting to exclude From header field domains not aligned with email acceptance methods in a manner incompatible with normal email conventions.  DMARC does not accommodate recent message structure underscoring the erroneous premise of a store-and-forward transport enforcing non-negotiable message structure.  Active exploitation of DMARC dependency on flawed acceptance practices are further aggravated when its feedback is sent to malefactors.  Risks prevented by careful accommodation of legitimate and valid messages also better ensures economic, social, and civic benefits derived from an open exchange of email.</t></abstract>
