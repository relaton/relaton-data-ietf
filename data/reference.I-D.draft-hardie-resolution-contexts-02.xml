<abstract><t>If we model the system of Internet names as a set of directed graphs in an absolute naming context, following RFC 819, an Internet name is not necessarily a name in the domain name system, but is simply a unique name associated with a particular directed graph.  The resolution of the name, in other words, is independent from it being an "Internet name".  The DNS is a common, but not the only, resolution context for Internet names.  This document discusses the consequences of the need to select among multiple resolution contexts.</t></abstract>
