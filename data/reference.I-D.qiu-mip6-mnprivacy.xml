<abstract><t>When a mobile node roams, its location information can be revealed by monitoring the IP addresses in its IP packets. This document proposes a technique for hiding a mobile node's care-of adress from its correspondent node and its home address from an eavesdropper using reverse tunelling. It also proposes another technique for preventing movement tracing of a mobile node by an eavesdropper during route optimization.</t></abstract>
