<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in the state of resources.  This document defines a new mechanism in CoAP Observe so that a CoAP client can conditionally observe a resource on a CoAP server, only being informed about state changes meeting a specific condition.  Note  Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</t></abstract>
