<abstract><t>This document standardizes both 1) a means of requesting a stream of packet samples from any device generating, routing, or forwarding traffic, and 2) receiving metadata information from the network element about these packet samples, and the structure of said stream metadata.  A main design requirement is to provide network elements with widely varying capabilities (e.g., ASICs, NPUs, NICs, vSwitches, CPUs) a mechanism to sample and export packets at high rates, by allowing communication of the specific bit formats of internal data headers applied to the packet flow, in a way that enhances interoperability between traffic sources and sinks.  Historically, Netflow and similar mechanisms have been used for these use cases; however, the increasing packet rates of very high-speed devices and increasing variance in the information available to data planes lends itself to both a less-prescriptive set of packet formats as well as a decoupling of the sampling action from the collection and analysis mechanisms.</t></abstract>
