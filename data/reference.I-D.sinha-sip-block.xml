<abstract><t>This document defines a new response code, 4XX(Blocked), for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This response code can be used by User Agent Client (UAC) that intentionally does not want to have session with an incoming request from another user with particular SIP services. For example UAC does not want to establish a session with an incoming request for video conference from particular domain. The existing mechanisms in SIP do not provide any such facility to refuse a request based request Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), SIP application, media type or other SIP services.</t></abstract>
