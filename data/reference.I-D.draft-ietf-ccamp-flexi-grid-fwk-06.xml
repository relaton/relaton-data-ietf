<abstract><t>To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for high bit-rate systems, the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has extended its Recommendations G.694.1 and G.872 to include a new dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) grid by defining a set of nominal central frequencies, channel spacings and the concept of "frequency slot".  In such an environment, a data plane connection is switched based on allocated, variable-sized frequency ranges within the optical spectrum creating what is known as a flexible grid (flexi- grid).  Given the specific characteristics of flexi-grid optical networks and their associated technology, this document defines a framework and the associated control plane requirements for the application of the existing GMPLS architecture and control plane protocols to the control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.  The actual extensions to the GMPLS protocols will be defined in companion documents.</t></abstract>
