<abstract><t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain. On every link in the PCN domain, the overall rate of the PCN-traffic is metered, and PCN-packets are appropriately marked when certain configured rates are exceeded.  Egress nodes provide decision points with information about the PCN-marks of PCN-packets which allows them to take decisions about whether to admit or block a new flow request, and to terminate some already admitted flows during serious pre- congestion.  This document specifies how PCN-marks are to be encoded into the IP header by re-using the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) codepoints within a PCN-domain.  This encoding builds on the baseline encoding of RFC5696 and provides for three different PCN marking states using a single DSCP: not-marked (NM), threshold-marked (ThM) and excess-traffic-marked (ETM).  Hence, it is called the 3-in-1 PCN encoding.</t></abstract>
