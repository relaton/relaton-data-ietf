<abstract><t>This document provides a survey of commonly used or notable network security protocols, with a focus on how they interact and integrate with applications and transport protocols.  Its goal is to supplement efforts to define and catalog transport services [RFC8095] by describing the interfaces required to add security protocols.  It examines Transport Layer Security (TLS), Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), Quick UDP Internet Connections with TLS (QUIC + TLS), MinimalT, CurveCP, tcpcrypt, Internet Key Exchange with Encapsulating Security Protocol (IKEv2 + ESP), SRTP (with DTLS), and WireGuard.  This survey is not limited to protocols developed within the scope or context of the IETF, and those included represent a superset of features a TAPS system may need to support.</t></abstract>
