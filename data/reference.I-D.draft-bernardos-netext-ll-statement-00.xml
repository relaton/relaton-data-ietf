<abstract><t>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6 enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without changing the IP address.  PMIPv6 also provides limited multi-homing support to multi-mode mobile devices.  Proxy mobility is based on the assumption that changes in host IP stacks are undesirable.  However, link layer implementations can hide the actually used physical interfaces from the IP stack.  These techniques can be used to achieve inter-access handovers or flow mobility, i.e., the movement of selected flows from one access technology to another.  It is assumed that an IP layer interface can simultaneously and/or sequentially attach to multiple MAGs (possibly over multiple media).  This document provides an informational applicability statement that analyzes the issues involved with this approach and characterizes the contexts in which such use is or is not appropriate.</t></abstract>
