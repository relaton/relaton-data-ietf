<abstract><t>Flooding is useful for many reasons in ad hoc networks, but causes congestion that can block traffic. Selecting multi-point relays (MPRs) reduces congestion due to flooding, but has several disadvantages. It is possible to select a subset of the MPRs to do the same job more effectively. In this document, signaling is specified for identifying a relatively small connected dominating set that can still manage the flooding operation.</t></abstract>
