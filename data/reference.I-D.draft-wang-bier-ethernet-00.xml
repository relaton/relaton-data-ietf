<abstract><t>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] is an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any multicast related per-flow state.  BIER also does not require any explicit tree-building protocol for its operation.  When a multicast data packet enters the BIER domain, the BFIR determines the BFERs to which the packet needs to be sent.  Then the BFIR encapsulates the packet in a BIER header and forwards the packet according to the BIFTs.  Currently, there is a BIER-MPLS solution to transmit multicast traffic using MPLS label indication.  Alternatively, this document tries to propose a solution named BIER Ethernet to support BIER forwarding in Ethernet network.</t></abstract>
