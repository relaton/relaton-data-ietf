<abstract><t>Adaptive DNS Discovery is chartered to define mechanisms that allow clients to discover and select encrypted DNS resolvers.  This document describes one common use case, namely that of clients that connect to a network but where they cannot securely authenticate the identity of that network.  In such cases the client would like to learn which encrypted DNS resolvers are designated by that network or by the Do53 resolver offered by that network.  It lists requirements that any proposed discovery mechanisms should seek to address.</t></abstract>
