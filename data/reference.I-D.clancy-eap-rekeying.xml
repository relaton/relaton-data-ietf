<abstract><t>A technique for fast rekeying with EAP is described here. The actual implementation is specific to each EAP method, but in general a master session key can be evolved with each client association such that the authentication requires as many packets exchanges as a 'canned success'. The concept is explained, with a specific implementation described for EAP-TLS with 802.11i.</t></abstract>
