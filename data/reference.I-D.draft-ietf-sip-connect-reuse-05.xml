<abstract><t>When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send a request, they typically originate their connections from an ephemeral port. The SIP protocol includes mechanisms which insure that responses to a request, and new requests sent in the original direction reuse an existing connection. However, new requests sent in the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existing connection. This frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use one connection for requests sent in each direction, and can result in potential scaling and performance problems. This document proposes requirements and a mechanism which address this deficiency in environments where the connection could be opened in either direction.</t></abstract>
