<abstract><t>The present specification describes a light extension of the TCP protocol [RFC793] that allows a TCP transport connection to be maintained operational whenever the underlying IP network address of its end-points changes.  This includes situations where a single- interface host changes its IP address or where a multiple-interface host diverts a connection from one interface to another.  The mechanism used to maintain a transport connection in such situations is based on the capability of both end-points to "Rehash" a TCP connection (rebuild its lookup key) with a new IP address in a fast and reliable manner.</t></abstract>
