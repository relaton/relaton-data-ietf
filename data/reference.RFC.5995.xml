<title>Using POST to Add Members to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Collections</title>

<abstract><t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Extensions for the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) do not define the behavior for the &quot;POST&quot; method when applied to collections, as the base specification (HTTP) leaves implementers lots of freedom for the semantics of &quot;POST&quot;.</t><t>This has led to a situation where many WebDAV servers do not implement POST for collections at all, although it is well suited to be used for the purpose of adding new members to a collection, where the server remains in control of the newly assigned URL.  In fact, the Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) uses POST exactly for that purpose.  On the other hand, WebDAV-based protocols, such as the Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV), frequently require clients to pick a unique URL, although the server could easily perform that task.</t><t>This specification defines a discovery mechanism through which servers can advertise support for POST requests with the aforementioned &quot;add collection member&quot; semantics.
