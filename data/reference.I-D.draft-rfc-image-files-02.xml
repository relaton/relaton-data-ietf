<abstract><t>Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCII characters and a fixed-width font.  However, there is sometimes a need to supplement the ASCII text with images -- e.g., graphics, equations, or pictures.  The historic solution to this requirement has allowed secondary PDF and/or Postscript files, but this approach has seldom been used because it is awkward for authors and publisher. This memo suggests a convenient scheme for logically including authoritative diagrams, illustrations, equations, or other graphics within RFCs.</t></abstract>
