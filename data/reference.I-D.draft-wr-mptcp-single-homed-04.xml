<abstract><t>Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at the end- systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained by different ISPs.  While this scenario is certainly becoming increasingly a reality (e.g.  mobile devices), currently most end- systems are single-homed (e.g.  desktop PCs in an enterprise).  This memo describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to multipath TCP-capable end-systems that are not available directly at the end-systems but somewhere within the network.</t></abstract>
