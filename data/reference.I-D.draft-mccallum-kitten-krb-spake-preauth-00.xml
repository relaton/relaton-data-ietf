<abstract><t>This document defines a new password authenticated key exchange based pre-authentication mechanism for performing Kerberos authentication. This mechanism has three goals.  First, it makes Kerberos pre- authentication more resilient against time synchronization errors by removing the need to transfer an encrypted timestamp.  Second, it increases the security of the Kerberos pre-authentication exchange by making offline brute-force attacks impossible.  Third, it enables the use of secure second factor authentication without FAST by utilizing the existing trust relationship established by the shared first factor.</t></abstract>
