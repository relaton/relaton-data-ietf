<abstract><t>This document specifies a NAT44 operation model where external ports are pre-allocated per subscriber. The NAT44 function is deployed in carrier's networks also known as CGN. Two new RADIUS attributes are proposed to support that operation for configuration and billing purpose. Translation logging on a NAT44 device is significantly reduced with this operational model.</t></abstract>
