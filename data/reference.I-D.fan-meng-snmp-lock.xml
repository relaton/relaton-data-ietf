<abstract><t>This memo is intended to provide a lock mechanism to SNMP for protecting SET operations from being interrupted by any other network management operations such as NETCONF &lt;edit-config> or CLI writes. This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular, it extends LOCK-MIB defined in [I-D.meng-fan-lock-mib] to define objects for managing SNMP locks.  The lock acquisition and release can be achieved through manipulating those objects.</t></abstract>
