<abstract><t>The Magic Mathematical Mesh 'the Mesh' is a security infrastructure for the Internet that puts individual users in control of their security. Through large scale redundancy and replication techniques, mesh users have a high level of assurance that data stored in the mesh through a mesh gateway node will be available at a later date.  The mesh does not offer confidentiality guarantees. All data in the mesh is assumed to be public. Confidential data stored in the mesh must be protected using strong encryption. The mesh provides a medium that enables the exchange of private key data but never passes private data of any form in plaintext form.  The mesh enables use of end-to-end and transport security with mutual authentication in a wide range of client server and peer-peer applications. These include email, remote access and the Web. Unlike previous attempts to establish such infrastructures, the password management application supported by the mesh delivers users with an immediate benefit that does not rely on adoption by others.</t></abstract>
