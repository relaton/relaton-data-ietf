<abstract><t>The Domain Name System standard facilities for maintaining coherent servers for a zone consist of three elements.  The Authoritative Transfer (AXFR) is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035.  The Incremental Zone Transfer (IXFR) is defined in RFC 1995.  A mechanism for prompt notification of zone changes (NOTIFY) is defined in RFC 1996.  The base definition of these facilities, that of the AXFR, has proven insufficient in detail, resulting in no implementation complying with it. Yet today we have a satisfactory set of implementations that do interoperate. This document is a new definition of the AXFR, new in the sense that is it recording an accurate definition of an interoperable AXFR mechanism.</t></abstract>
