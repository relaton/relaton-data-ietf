<abstract><t>This document presents some observations on &quot;simple best-effort traffic&quot;, defined loosely for the purposes of this document as Internet traffic that is not covered by Quality of Service (QOS) mechanisms, congestion-based pricing, cost-based fairness, admissions control, or the like.  One observation is that simple best-effort traffic serves a useful role in the Internet, and is worth keeping. While differential treatment of traffic can clearly be useful, we believe such mechanisms are useful as *adjuncts* to simple best- effort traffic, not as *replacements* of simple best-effort traffic.  A second observation is that for simple best-effort traffic, some form of rough flow-rate fairness is a useful goal for resource allocation, where &quot;flow-rate fairness&quot; is defined by the goal of equal flow rates for different flows over the same path.  This  memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
