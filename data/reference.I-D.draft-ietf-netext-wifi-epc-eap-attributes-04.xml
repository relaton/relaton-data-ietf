<abstract><t>With WiFi beginning to establishing itself as a trusted access network for service providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly available in 3G and 4G networks in WiFi access networks.  Such functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections and seamless mobility between WiFi and 3G/4G networks.  EAP/AKA (and EAP/AKA') is standardized by 3GPP as the access authentication protocol for trusted access networks.  This IETF specification is required for mobile devices to access the 3GPP Evolved Packet Core (EPC) networks.  This document defines a few new EAP attributes and procedures to provide the above-mentioned functions in trusted WiFi access networks.</t></abstract>
