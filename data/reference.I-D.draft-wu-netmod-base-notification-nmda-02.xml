<abstract><t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)and RESTCONF provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration datastores.  NMDA introduces additional datastores for systems that support more advanced processing chains converting configuration to operational state. However, client applications are not able to be aware of common events in these additional datstores of the management system, such as a applied configuration state change in NETCONF server or RESTCONF server, that may impact management applications.  This document define a YANG module that allows a client to receive additional notifications for some common system events pertaining to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].</t></abstract>
