<abstract><t>This document contains recommendations on how large Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can manage the effects of large numbers of bot infected computers used by their subscribers via various remediation techniques.  At the time that this document was published, computers infected by bots and the users of those computers comprise a substantial number of users for large ISPs.  Those Internet users are exposed to risks such as loss of personal data, increased susceptibility to online fraud and/or phishing, and becoming an inadvertent participant in or component of an online crime, spam, and/or phishing network.  Mitigating the effects of and remediating the installations of bots affecting large numbers of Internet users will make it more difficult for bot nets to operate and could reduce the level of online crime on the Internet in general and/or on a particular ISP's network.</t></abstract>
