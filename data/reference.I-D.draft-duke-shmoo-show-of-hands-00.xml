<abstract><t>This is the specification for an experimental show of hands tool for the Meetecho system to be used in online meetings to help chairs quickly poll the meeting.  This tool is different from the previous experimental virtual hum tool as it addresses a different use case with different functionality.  Following mixed feedback in the IETF 108 post-meeting survey, the experimental virtual hum tool has been withdrawn from the Meetecho client for IETF 109.</t></abstract>
