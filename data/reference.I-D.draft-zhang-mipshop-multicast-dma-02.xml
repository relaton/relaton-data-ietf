<abstract><t>This document addresses the problem of delivering IPv6 multicast traffic to MNs (Mobile Nodes). An approach named Mobile IPv6 Multicast with Dynamic Multicast Agent is proposed. The approach is a combination of Movement Based Method [2] and Distance Based Method [3]. Such a design allows MNs to optimize multicast routes, and meanwhile reduces the number of handoffs by selecting new multicast agents dynamically. In addition to weakening the triangle route problem and diminishing the influence of handoff to multicast, this approach provides global mobility in the Internet without the restriction on network topologies. This draft is the same as the earlier version. It's just an updation of the version.</t></abstract>
