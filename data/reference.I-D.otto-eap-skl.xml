<abstract><t>This document describes EAP-SKL, an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) method which provides mutual authentication and key derivation based on a pre-shared secret. EAP-SKL relies on the cryptographic protocol SKEME (Secure Key Exchange MEchanism protocol), and hence may benefit from its simplicity and the provable security. EAP-SKL complies with the mandatory requirements for an EAP method which is intented for deployment in Wireless LAN environments.</t></abstract>
