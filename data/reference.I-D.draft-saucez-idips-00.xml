<abstract><t>This draft describes a simple network-based protocol to facilitate Path Selection and to improve traffic engineering capabilities in multihomed corporate networks.  With this protocol, any network device that requires to select a path among a list of different paths asks a Traffic Engineering service called IDIPS (ISP-Driven Informed Path Selection) to obtain an ordered list of the possible paths.  The ordering is constructed according to policies and performance requirements of both the host and network provider.</t></abstract>
