<abstract><t>Enterprise networks deploy a variety of security devices to protect the network, hosts and endpoints.  Network security devices, both hardware and virtual, operate at all OSI layers with scanning and analysis capabilities for application content.  Multiple specific devices are often deployed together for breadth and depth of defense. This document describes use cases of Service Function Chaining (SFC) when deploying network security devices in the manner described above and also puts forth requirements for their effective operation.</t></abstract>
