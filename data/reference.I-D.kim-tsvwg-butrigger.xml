<abstract><t>In Mobile IPv6 environment, TCP connections between MN (mobile node) and CN (correspondent node) suffer a significant degradation in performance in the form of poor throughput and very high interactive delays during handoff. This note describes an optional modification of TCP's congestion control mechanism for performance enhancement by using Binding Update messages to invoke TCP's congestion control processing. This modification is applied to TCP of CN side, and no additional processing requirement is added to MN to save MN's power.</t></abstract>
