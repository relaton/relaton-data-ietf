<abstract><t>Section 2.5.1.5 of RFC 4733 specifies how an implementation of the telephony-event payload type can pack multiple short-duration event reports into one RTP packet. Because this capability was added to RFC 4733 in a fashion which is not backward compatible with RFC 2833, it is desirable that a sender have the means to determine whether the receiver understands such packets. This memo specifies a new SDP attribute, a=multev, to indicate that capability.</t></abstract>
