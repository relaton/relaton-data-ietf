<abstract><t>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IP- based vehicular networking for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle- to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to- everything (V2X) communications.  First, this document explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  Next, it makes a problem statement about key aspects in IP-based vehicular networking, such as IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, and Security &amp; Privacy. For each key aspect, this document specifies requirements in IP-based vehicular networking, and suggests the direction of solutions satisfying those requirements.</t></abstract>
