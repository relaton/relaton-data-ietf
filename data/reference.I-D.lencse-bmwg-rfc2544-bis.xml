<abstract><t>RFC 2544 has defined a benchmarking methodology for network interconnect devices.  We recommend a few upgrades to it for producing more reasonable results.  The recommended upgrades can be classified into two categories: the application of the novelties of RFC 8219 for the legacy RFC 2544 use cases and the following new ones.  Checking a reasonably small timeout individually for every single frame in the throughput and frame loss rate benchmarking procedures.  Performing a statistically relevant number of tests for all benchmarking procedures.  Addition of an optional non-zero frame loss acceptance criterion for the throughput measurement procedure and defining its reporting format.</t></abstract>
