<abstract><t>This document discuss the relationships between the Internet architecture and the ability of people to exercise their right to freedom of assembly and association online.  The Internet increasingly mediates our lives, our relationships and our ability to exercise our human rights.  As a forum, it provides a global public space despite being built on predominantly private infrastructure. Since Internet protocols play a central role in the management, development and use of the Internet, the relation between protocols and the aforementioned rights should be analyzed and any adverse impacts should be mitigated.</t></abstract>
