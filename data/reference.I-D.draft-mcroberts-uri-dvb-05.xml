<abstract><t>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme resources transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG-Systems] have been devised in their process of creating standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and the OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and future scheduled publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications such as HTTP, MHP [DVB-MHP], OCAP [OCAP1.0] or other XML based metadata.  These URI locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other multimedia broadcast programme service (i.e. channel or event) and the audio- visual components conforming to that programme for e.g. a HTTP based programme guide in the internet or other XML based programme guides in digital broadcast set-top boxes.  This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the Internet community, given its definition as part of the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.</t></abstract>
