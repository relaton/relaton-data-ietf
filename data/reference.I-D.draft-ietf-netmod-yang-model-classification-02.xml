<abstract><t>The YANG [RFC6020] data modeling language is currently being considered for a wide variety of applications throughout the networking industry at large.  Many standards-defining organizations (SDOs), open source software projects, vendors and users are using YANG to develop and publish YANG modules of configuration, state data and operations for a wide variety of applications.  At the same time, there is currently no well-known terminology to categorize various types of YANG modules.  A consistent terminology would help with the categorization of YANG modules, assist in the analysis the YANG data modeling efforts in the IETF and other organizations, and bring clarity to the YANG-related discussions between the different groups.  This document describes a set of concepts and associated terms to support consistent classification of YANG modules.</t></abstract>
