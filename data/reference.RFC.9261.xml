<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism that builds on Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and enables peers to provide proof of ownership of an identity, such as an X.509 certificate.  This proof can be exported by one peer, transmitted out of band to the other peer, and verified by the receiving peer.</t></abstract>
