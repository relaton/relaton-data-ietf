<abstract><t>This document specifies a new certificate type for exchanging raw public keys in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) for use with out-of-band public key validation. Currently, TLS authentication can only occur via X.509-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or OpenPGP certificates.  By specifying a minimum resource for raw public key exchange, implementations can use alternative public key validation methods.  One such alternative public key valiation method is offered by the DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) together with DNS Security.  Another alternative is to utilize pre-configured keys, as is the case with sensors and other embedded devices.  The usage of raw public keys, instead of X.509-based certificates, leads to a smaller code footprint.  This document introduces the support for raw public keys in TLS.</t></abstract>
