<abstract><t>The WebSocket protocol [I-D.ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol] provides a subprotocol extension facility.  The MessageBroker WebSocket Subprotocol (MBWS) is a WebSocket Subprotocol used by messaging clients to send messages to, and receive messages from an internet message broker (herein called a message broker).  A message broker is a messaging intermediary that queues messages sent by its clients for asynchronous delivery to its clients.  Messages are addressed to message-broker-specific address names. Clients send messages to addresses and consume messages from addresses.  Clients do not send messages directly to other clients.  Message brokers provide a range of functionality that is outside the scope of MBWS.  Typically an internet message broker provides a REST API for working with this functionality; such as configuring client credentials; setting client access controls; configuring address routing; etc.  MBWS limits its scope to the definition of a WebSocket subprotocol that provides a full duplex, reliable message transport protocol between message brokers and their clients; and, between message brokers.  Since reliable message transport is often independent of a broker's particular features, MBWS can be used as the message transport protocol for a wide range of message brokers.  The MBWS subprotocol defines a binary message frame and a text message frame.  Both types of frame carry the same protocol; however, the protocol bindings differ slightly.  The binary frame is a WebSocket binary message that contains an MBWS binary header followed by a binary message body.  The text frame is a WebSocket UTF-8 text message that contains an MBWS text header followed by a text message body.</t></abstract>
