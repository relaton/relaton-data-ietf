<abstract><t>A dual-end recursive PCE-based computation procedure (DRPC) is proposed to compute shortest constrained inter-domain traffic engineering label switched paths based on BRPC in Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  Path computation is launched at the source PCE and the destination PCE simultaneously.  Then two shortest path graphs are generated at the middle PCE, which are stitched into a shortest path directional graph last.  Therefore, the end-to-end constrained inter-domain traffic engineering label switched path, even k shortest paths can be gained from the shortest path directional graph directly.</t></abstract>
