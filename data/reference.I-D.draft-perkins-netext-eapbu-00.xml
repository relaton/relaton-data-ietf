<abstract><t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is commonly used for access authentication in many wireless networks.  EAP methods often involve AAA servers to effect the required authentications; notifications about success or failure are then relayed back to a functional module in the access network known as the Network Access Server.  The Binding Authentication Data option has been defined for enabling alternative methods for authentication in the context of Mobile IPv6, and there is a subtype allocated for AAA-based authentication methods such as EAP.  However, some EAP methods require additional handling that requires specification not yet available in the existing documentation for the Binding Authentication Data option.  This document provides the required specification for at least some very widely deployed EAP methods.  In many situations requiring the use of EAP, this enables much faster operation for Mobile IPv6 tunnel redirection to a wireless device's new care-of address by avoiding having to do multiple authentications.</t></abstract>
