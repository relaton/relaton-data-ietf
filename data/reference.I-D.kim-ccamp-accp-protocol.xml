<abstract><t>The configuration of control channels with a higher reliability would be an important factor for the more stable provision of communication environment in non-(G)MPLS and (G)MPLS networks. This document specifies an automatic control channel protection (ACCP) protocol that runs between a pair of nodes and is used to support the resilience capability of control channels. The ACCP protocol is based on the concept of common channel signaling in ITU-T and the current control channel management function of LMP in IETF. This ACCP protocol provides functions such as identification of direct and indirect control channels, automatic and forced switchover of those channels, and so on for the resilience of control channels.</t></abstract>
