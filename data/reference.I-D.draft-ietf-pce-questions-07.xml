<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture is set out in RFC 4655. The architecture is extended for multi-layer networking with the introduction of the Virtual Network Topology Manager (VNTM) in RFC 5623, and generalized to Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) in RFC 6805.  These three architectural views of PCE deliberately leave some key questions unanswered especially with respect to the interactions between architectural components.  This document draws out those questions and discusses them in an architectural context with reference to other architectural components, existing protocols, and recent IETF work efforts.  This document does not update the architecture documents and does not define how protocols or components must be used.  It does, however, suggest how the architectural components might be combined to provide advanced PCE function.</t></abstract>
