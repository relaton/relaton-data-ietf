<abstract><t>IPv6 interfaces are required to have a link-local address that is unique on the link.  Nodes normally derive a link local address through the use of IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) and employ Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) to ensure uniqueness. This document presents a method for a node that obtains a delegated prefix to statelessly construct a link-local address (known as the "AERO address") that is assured to be unique on the link.</t></abstract>
