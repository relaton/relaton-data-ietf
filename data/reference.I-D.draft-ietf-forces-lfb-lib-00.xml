<abstract><t>The forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol defines a standard communication and control mechanism through which a Control Element (CE) can control the behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE).  That control is accomplished through manipulating components of Logical Function Blocks (LFBs), whose structure is defined in a model RFC produced by the working group.In order to build an actual solution using this protocol, there needs to be a set of Logical Function Block definitions that can be instantiated by FEs and controlled by CEs.  This document provides a sample space of such definitions.  It is anticipated that additional defining documents will be produced over time.</t></abstract>
