<abstract><t>This document provides an overview of a workshop held by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on Internet Technology Adoption and Transition (ITAT).  The workshop was hosted by the University of Cambridge in Cambridge on December 4th and 5th of 2013.  The goal of the workshop was to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols, through examination of a variety of economic models, with particular emphasis at the waist of the hourglass.  This report summarizes contributions and discussions.  As the topics were wide ranging, there is no single set of recommendations for IETF participants to pursue at this time.  Instead, in the classic sense of early research, the workshop noted areas that deserve further exploration.  Note that this document is a report on the proceedings of the workshop.  The views and positions documented in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect IAB views and positions.</t></abstract>
