<abstract><t>The standard means within the Domain Name System protocol for maintaining coherence among a zone's authoritative name servers consists of three mechanisms.  Authoritative Transfer (AXFR) is one of the mechanisms and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035.  The definition of AXFR has proven insufficient in detail, thereby forcing implementations intended to be compliant to make assumptions, impeding interoperability.  Yet today we have a satisfactory set of implementations that do interoperate.  This document is a new definition of AXFR -- new in the sense that it records an accurate definition of an interoperable AXFR mechanism.</t></abstract>
