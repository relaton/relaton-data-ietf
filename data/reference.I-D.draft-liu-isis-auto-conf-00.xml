<abstract><t>This document describes mechanisms for IS-IS to be self-configuring. Such mechanisms could reduce the management burden to configure a network. One obvious environment that could benefit from these mechanisms is IPv6 home network where plug-and-play would be expected. Besides home network, some simple enterprise/ISP networks might also potentially benefit from the self-configuring mechanisms.</t></abstract>
