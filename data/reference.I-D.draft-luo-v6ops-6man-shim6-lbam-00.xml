<abstract><t>Load balancing is a key factor for both IPv4 to IPv6 transition mechnisms, e.g.NAT-PT or Tunnel broker, and Multihoming to improve their scalability and Robustness.  In fact, that is a method, by which IP packet can be distributed across a pool of servers, instead of directing to a single server.Load balancing has been widely used by NAT, Web service and FTP service.  However, current load balancing software and implementations have problems such as poor scalability, inability to balance session flow, long latency time and topological constraint on server pool.</t></abstract>
