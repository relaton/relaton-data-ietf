<abstract><t>This document defines two URI schemes.  The first, 'duri' (standing for "dated URI"), identifies a resource as of a particular time. This allows explicit reference to the "time of retrieval", similar to the way in which bibliographic references containing URIs are often written.  The second scheme, 'tdb' ( standing for "Thing Described By"), provides a way of minting URIs for anything that can be described, by the means of identifying a description as of a particular time. These schemes were posited as "thought experiments", and therefore this document is designated as Experimental.</t></abstract>
