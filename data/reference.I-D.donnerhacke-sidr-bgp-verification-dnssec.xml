<abstract><t>This document describes an infrastructure for real time verification of routes reveived via BGP4.  Some DNS query types are introduced to check the origin of a prefix and validity of the AS path. The crypto part can be offloaded from the routing engine by sending a DNS query and checking the AD bit in the DNS response. The proposal depends on the DNS scalability and caching mechanisms as well as PKI introduced by DNSSEC.</t></abstract>
