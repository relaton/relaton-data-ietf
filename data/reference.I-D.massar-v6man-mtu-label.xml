<abstract><t>This document redefines the use of the IPv6 Flow Label field to allow specification of the lowest MTU on a path that the packet travels, thus in most cases avoiding the need for performing Path MTU Discovery and the round-trip penalty that that occurs for processing the ICMPv6 PTB and retransmitting the packets involved.  This specification allows graceful decrease of MTU so that large and non-standard MTU sizes can safely be used on the Internet.  [[A1: Obsoleting the IPv6 Flow Label and replacing it completely with this field might be a better option than keeping it defined as an IPv6 Flow Label field and allowing existing flows to exist.  --JM]] [[A2: A better name than "IPv6 MTU Label" is requested as it is not really a "Label".  --JM]]</t></abstract>
