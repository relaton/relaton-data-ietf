<abstract><t>In many VoIP networks today, firewalls and session border controllers are used at the edge of an administrative domain to allow authorized UDP media flows to enter or leave the network. This document introduces a new mechanism to authorize a UDP media flow. This mechanism works with encrypted hop-by-hop signaling, end-to-end authenticated signaling, and multihomed networks. The media authorization is performed using an Interactive Connectivity Establishment-capable endpoint and a calling signaling device that authorizes a firewall to permit a flow.</t></abstract>
