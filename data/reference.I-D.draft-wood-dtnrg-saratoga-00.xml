<abstract><t>Saratoga is a simple, lightweight UDP-based transport protocol intended for use between immediately neighbouring peers which have sporadic, intermittent connectivity using dedicated IP links. Saratoga focuses on link utilization and loss recovery via an ARQ mechanism. Saratoga is not intended for use over shared paths, so transport congestion control is unnecessary. Saratoga is in continuous use by the IP-based Disaster Monitoring Constellation satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and is proposed for use as a convergence layer by Delay Tolerant Networking for deep-space and ad- hoc networking scenarios.</t></abstract>
