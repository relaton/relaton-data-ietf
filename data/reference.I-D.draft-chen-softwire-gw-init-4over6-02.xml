<abstract><t>Gateway-Initiated 4over6 is a variant of Lightweight 4over6.  A Lightweight B4 in Lightweight 4over6 mechanism is a router which acts as a tunnel initiator for the IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  This mechanism mainly focuses on the scenario in which an IPv4 address and related configuration information is configured to the device behind Lightweight B4.  Gateway-Initiated 4over6 uses the full IPv4 address rather than a shared address.  This enables an unmodified end server or host that is behind a Lightweight B4 to get access to the IPv4 Internet through an IPv6 network.</t></abstract>
