<abstract><t>Surveillance is the observation or monitoring of an individual's communications or activities.  Surveillance is one of several privacy /security threats engineers try to take into account in their designs.  The reports about pervasive monitoring of Internet traffic have, however, surprised many since the scale was not envisaged during the design of many Internet protocols.
