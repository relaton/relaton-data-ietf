<abstract><t>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. The requesting router then acts as a router between the downstream- attached hosts and the upstream Internetwork, and can also act as a host under the weak end system model.  This document considers the case when the "requesting router" is actually a simple host which receives a delegated prefix that it can use solely for its own internal multi-addressing purposes under the strong end system model. This method can be applied in a wide variety of use cases to allow ample address availability without impacting link performance.</t></abstract>
