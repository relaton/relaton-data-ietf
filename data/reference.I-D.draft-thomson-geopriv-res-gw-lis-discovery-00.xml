<abstract><t>The residential gateway is an ubiquitous device that has become an integral part of home networking equipment.  Discovering a Location Information Server (LIS) is a necessary part of aquiring location information for location-based services.  However, discovering a LIS when a residential gateway is present poses a configuration challenge, requiring a method that is able to work around the obstacle presented by the gateway.  This document describes the problem of discovering a LIS in the presence of a residential gateway.  The current version includes two proposed solutions to this problem, which will be evaluated.</t></abstract>
