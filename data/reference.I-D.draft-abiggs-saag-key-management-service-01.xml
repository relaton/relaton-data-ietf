<abstract><t>In the interest of addressing pervasive threats to the confidentiality and integrity of online communications identified by the Internet community [I-D.barnes-pervasive-problem] this specification introduces an open architecture for the establishment, management, and secure distribution of cryptographic keys for use in the end-to-end (E2E) encryption of online communications and shared content.  This architecture allows for the independent deployment of dedicated key management services in a manner that supports the adoption of third-party communications and data sharing services by individuals and organizations that require full and exclusive discretion over the confidentiality of their data.</t></abstract>
