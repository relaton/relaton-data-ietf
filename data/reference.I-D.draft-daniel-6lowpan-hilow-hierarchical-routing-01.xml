<abstract><t>The EUI-64 identifier of a 6LoWPAN device can be used as the interface identifier of the IPv6 address, which can be used for for on-demand multi-hop routing in 6LoWPAN. One of the distinctive feature of 6LoWPAN is the capability of the dynamic assignment of 16- bit short addresses. By utilizing this dynamically assigned short address, a hierarchical routing which is very scalable can be employed. This This document defines a dynamic address assignment scheme and hierarchical routing HiLow) based on the assignment.</t></abstract>
