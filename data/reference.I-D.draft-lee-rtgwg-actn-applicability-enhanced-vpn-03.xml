<abstract><t>The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) defines an SDN-based architecture that relies on the concepts of network and service abstraction to detach network and service control from the underlying data plane.  This document outlines the overview of ACTN capability and the applicability of ACTN to Enhanced VPN. In particular, this document also discusses how ACTN features can fulfill some of the requirements of the enhanced VPN, which is also known as VPN+ [VPN+].</t></abstract>
