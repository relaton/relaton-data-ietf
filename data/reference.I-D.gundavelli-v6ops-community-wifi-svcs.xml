<abstract><t>The tremendous growth in Wi-Fi technology adoption over the last decade has met the ultimate possible goal of 100% adoption rate.  All most every new mobile device is now equipped with IEEE 802.11-based wireless interface and with pre-configured policy to prefer Wi-Fi to cellular access.  Matching this evolution is every service provider's desire to offer Wi-Fi based broadband services; a new business opportunity even for fixed line operators.  Operators are exploring options to monetize their existing networks, most with nation-wide footprint, to build a high-speed Wi-Fi service that can be the basis for offering new wireless broadband services.  This document identifies the requirements for supporting these new Wi-Fi community services and the mobility tools which have been standardized in IETF that can be used for enabling these architectures.</t></abstract>
