<abstract><t>This document describes the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) designed to provide retransmission-based reliability over links characterized by extremely long message round-trip times (RTTs) and/or frequent interruptions in connectivity. Since communication across interplanetary space is the most prominent example of this sort of environment, LTP is principally aimed at supporting "long- haul" reliable transmission in interplanetary space, but has applications in other environments as well. In an Interplanetary Internet setting deploying the Bundling protocol being developed by the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group, LTP is intended to serve as a reliable convergence layer over single hop deep-space RF links. LTP does ARQ of data transmissions by soliciting selective-acknowledgment reception reports. It is stateful, and has no negotiation or handshakes. This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.</t></abstract>
