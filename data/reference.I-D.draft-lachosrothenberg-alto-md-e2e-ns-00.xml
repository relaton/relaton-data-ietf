<abstract><t>Evolving networking scenarios (e.g., 5G) are considering the provision of value-added and on-demand end-to-end (E2E) network services in multi-domain (multi-operator/multi-technology) environments.  This document presents different initiatives, mainly within standardization efforts and research projects, working on E2E network services across multiple domains.  Problem statement and a layered network model are also described.  In addition, this document raises an initial proposal towards a new ALTO service in support of E2E network service requirements.  Finally, another important objective of this document is to begin a discussion about motivating use cases in scope of the ALTO WG after the re-chartering process.</t></abstract>
