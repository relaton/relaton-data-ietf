<abstract><t>The Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) allows network OAM applications to directly collect and export telemetry data about any user packet at each node on the forwarding path.  PBT has two variations.  One requires inserting an instruction header to user packets to guide the data collection.  This variation has been recast into an independent IOAM option mode, Direct Export, and described in a standalone document.  This document describes the second variation, the mark triggered PBT or PBT-M.  PBT-M only marks the user packets or configure the flow filter to invoke the data collection and postcard export.  It complements IOAM by addressing several specific implementation and deployment challenges.</t></abstract>
