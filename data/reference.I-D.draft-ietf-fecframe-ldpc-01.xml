<abstract><t>This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for LDPC- Staircase codes that can be used to protect media streams along the lines defined by the FECFRAME framework.  These codes have many interesting properties: they are systematic codes, they perform close to ideal codes in many use-cases and they also feature very high encoding and decoding throughputs.  LDPC-Staircase codes are therefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate source flow, or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a single FECFRAME instance.  They are also a good solution whenever the processing load of a software encoder or decoder must be kept to a minimum.</t></abstract>
