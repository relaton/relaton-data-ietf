<abstract><t>In this paper, a kind of self-organizing network model, which provides a new kind of network model based on the swarm intelligence for the suppliers, was introduced.  The document defines the problems of the existing network, as well as the characteristics of the next generation Internet NGI, illustrates the motivation of self- organizing network model.  In this paper, a network architecture model based on a kind of swarm intelligence was introduced, the collection technical term was defined, network parameters in the network node, network behavior and the node stability depict portrait was described.  The document describes the important factors such as the user needs under the self-organizing network model, the network satisfaction, the avail computing, the path and multicast tree evaluation, the mathematical models of the QoS routing optimization, small-world behavior and so on, which have a relationship with the self-organizing network QoS routing.</t></abstract>
