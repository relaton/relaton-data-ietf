<abstract><t>When an IP address is shared among several subscribers -- with a NAT or with an application-level proxy -- it is impossible for the server to differentiate between different clients.  Such differentiation is valuable in several scenarios.  This memo describes a technique to differentiate TCP clients sharing an IP address.  The proposed method uses a TCP option, which avoids altering the application-level payload and works well with SSL-protected connections.</t></abstract>
