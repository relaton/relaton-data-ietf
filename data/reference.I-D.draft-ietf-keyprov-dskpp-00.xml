<abstract><t>DSKPP is a client-server protocol for initialization (and configuration) of symmetric keys to locally and remotely accessible cryptographic modules. The protocol can be run with or without private-key capabilities in the cryptographic modules, and with or without an established public-key infrastructure. Three variations of the protocol support multiple usage scenarios. The four-pass (i.e., two round-trip) variant enables key generation in near real-time. With the four-pass variant, keys are mutually generated by the provisioning server and cryptographic module; provisioned keys are not transferred over-the-wire or over-the-air. Two- and one-pass variants enable secure and efficient download and installation of symmetric keys to a cryptographic module in environments where near real-time communication may not be possible. This document builds on information contained in [RFC4758], adding specific enhancements in response to implementation experience and liaison requests. It is intended, therefore, that this document or a successor version thereto will become the basis for subsequent progression of a symmetric key provisioning protocol specification on the standards track.</t></abstract>
