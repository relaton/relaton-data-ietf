<abstract><t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has become widely deployed on the Internet, covering a wide range of usages from toll bypass to instant messaging, from service provider to enterprise.  However, its realization in actual deployments differs in important ways from the specifications.  This has created a gulf between existing and ongoing standards work, and real live deployments.  This document argues that the RAI area should focus on solving real world interoperability issues and address real world functional gaps.</t></abstract>
