<abstract><t>This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax.  WalnutDSA is a lightweight, quantum-resistant signature scheme based on Group Theoretic Cryptography with implementation and computational efficiency of signature verification in constrained environments, even on 8- and 16-bit platforms.  The goal of this publication is to document a way to use the lightweight, quantum-resistant WalnutDSA signature algorithm in COSE in a way that would allow multiple developers to build compatible implementations.  As of this publication, WalnutDSA has not been endorsed by the IETF.  WalnutDSA(TM) and Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm(TM) are trademarks of Veridify Security Inc..</t></abstract>
