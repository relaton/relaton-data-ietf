<abstract><t>Enterprise networks connect hosts and routers over various link types, and may also connect to provider networks and/or the global Internet.  Enterprise network nodes require a means to automatically provision IP addresses/prefixes and support internetworking operation in a wide variety of use cases including Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), ISP networks, multi-organizational corporate networks and the interdomain core of the global Internet itself.  This document specifies a Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) abstraction for autoconfiguration and operation of nodes in enterprise networks.  VET can also be considered as version 2 of the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (i.e., "ISATAPv2").</t></abstract>
