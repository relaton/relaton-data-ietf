<abstract><t>This document describes the Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF) protocol that provides a basic IP multicast forwarding capability within mobile ad-hoc networks (MANET). SMF is designed to have limited applicability as a forwarding mechanism for multicast packets within MANET routing areas. In addition, it provides mechanisms to support interoperability with a connected wired infrastructure. SMF uses packets to all MANET multicast receivers within a MANET routing area. The core design does not use receiver specific group information in favor of reduced complexity and state maintenance within the mobile topology. Such extensions may follow in later specifications. The design accounts for the unique nature and behavior of MANET interfaces and takes advantage of efficient relay set algorithms previously designed and applied in the MANET routing control plane. This document describes the SMF forwarding mechanisms in detail, specifies an optional SMF neighborhood discovery protocol, and describes several efficient relay set algorithms that have been implemented in conjunction with SMF.</t></abstract>
