<abstract><t>The dynamic allocation of computing resources on a massive scale through the use of virtual machines running over a "hypervisor" layer to serve a large number of customers and applications simultaneously brings a number of benefits but also a number of challenges to data center operations.  Such challenges range from acquiring the information needed to provision the physical servers, storage and networking elements, through accounting for resource and application usage at the user level.  The Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) has begun the work of developing the standards needed to support this work, but many tasks remain.  This document provides a brief survey of the problem space, but focusses on the requirements for operation and management of network resources within the data center complex and between that complex and the users.</t></abstract>
