<abstract><t>This document defines a new protocol value "Application" for the Reason Header field and a new IANA Registry for registering application types.  This new value enables signaling that a request or response has been issued as a result of a decision made by a particular type of application or that an initial request has been retargeted as a result of an application decision.</t></abstract>
