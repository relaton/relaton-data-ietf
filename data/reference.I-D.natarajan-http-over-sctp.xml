<abstract><t>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] requires a reliable transport for end-to-end communication.  While historically TCP has been used for this purpose, this document proposes an alternative -- the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960].  Similar to TCP, SCTP offers a reliable end-to-end transport connection to applications.  Additionally, SCTP offers innovative services unavailable in TCP.  This draft (i) specifies HTTP over SCTP's multistreaming service, (ii) lists open issues warranting more discussion and/or investigation, and (iii) shares some lessons learned from implementing HTTP over SCTP.  Finally, this document highlights SCTP services that better match HTTP's needs than TCP.</t></abstract>
