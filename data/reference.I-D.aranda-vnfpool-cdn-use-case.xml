<abstract><t>This use case document provides requirements for moving Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) from physical servers to a virtualized environment. This new kind of CDN, known as virtualized CDN (vCDN), allows for new constructs that simplify the CDN architecture. The main elements of the CDN are analyzed with regards to the degree of elasticity demanded from them in terms of computation, storage and network resources.  This use case document provides resiliency requirements for virtualization of the Content Distribution Network, known as virtualized CDN (vCDN).</t></abstract>
