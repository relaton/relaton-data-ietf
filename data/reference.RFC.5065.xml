<abstract><t>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol designed for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) networks.  BGP requires that all BGP speakers within a single autonomous system (AS) must be fully meshed.  This represents a serious scaling problem that has been well documented in a number of proposals.</t><t>This document describes an extension to BGP that may be used to create a confederation of autonomous systems that is represented as a single autonomous system to BGP peers external to the confederation, thereby removing the &quot;full mesh&quot; requirement.  The intention of this extension is to aid in policy administration and reduce the management complexity of maintaining a large autonomous system.</t><t>This document obsoletes RFC 3065.
