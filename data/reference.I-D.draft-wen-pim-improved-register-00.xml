<abstract><t>In [PIM-SM], Register procedure needs to be triggered by multicast packets in the data-plane/forwarding-plane. The dependences of the control-plane on the data-plane/forwarding-plane to build control- plane state does not scale well. And also the encapsulation at the Designated Router and decapsulation at the Rendezvous Point are relatively expensive operations for routers. To solve the above- mentioned problems, this document proposes new mechanisms to make a clear separation of the control-plane and the data-plane/fowarding- plane for PIM register procedure.</t></abstract>
