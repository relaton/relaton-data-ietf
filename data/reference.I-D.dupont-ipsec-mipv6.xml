<abstract><t>IPsec specifications [1-6] do not work well with any mobility device based on addresses [7]. Mobile IPv6 interaction with IPsec is still far from being well achieved. This is mainly due to bad interpretations of IPsec specifications. HIP (Host Identity Payload) [9] should change this regrettable situation. This document specifies some points where improvements can be made in many current implementations, on the way of making IPsec more suitable for Mobile IPv6.</t></abstract>
