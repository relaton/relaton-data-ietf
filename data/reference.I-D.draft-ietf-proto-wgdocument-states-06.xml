<abstract><t>The IETF Datatracker tool will be enhanced to make it possible for working group Chairs to provide more transparency into the status and progression of working group documents to authors and other members of the IETF community.  This document defines the states that may be used to describe the status of an Internet-Draft (I-D) that is associated with an IETF working group (WG).  The first state can be used to describe an I-D that is being considered for adoption by a working group, and the last state describes an I-D that has been submitted to the IESG. Appendix A explains the different states used by IETF Area Directors to describe the status of I-Ds after they have been sent to the IESG for evaluation and publication.</t></abstract>
