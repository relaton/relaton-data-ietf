<abstract><t>This draft specifies a Per Domain Behavior that provides the ability to Diffserv nodes located at the border or outside Diffserv domain(s) to detect when the resources provided by the Diffserv domain(s) are not available. This PDB is used when the negotiated SLS is associated to throughput (or bandwidth) and when the SLS agreed throughput bound is not statically but loosely defined in order to allow a more efficient utilization of the Diffserv domain(s) and a more simple network management operation. This PDB can be applied in association with either a single Diffserv domain or multiple neighboring Diffserv domains. This specification is denoted as Resource Unavailability (RU) PDB and it follows the guidelines given in RFC 3086.</t></abstract>
