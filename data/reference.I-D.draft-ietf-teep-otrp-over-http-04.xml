<abstract><t>The Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) Protocol is used to manage code and configuration data in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  This document specifies the HTTP transport for TEEP communication where a Trusted Application Manager (TAM) service is used to manage TEEs in devices that can initiate communication to the TAM.  An implementation of this document can (if desired) run outside of any TEE, but interacts with a TEEP implementation that runs inside a TEE.</t></abstract>
