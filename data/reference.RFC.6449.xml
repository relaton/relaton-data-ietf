<abstract><t>Complaint Feedback Loops similar to those described herein have existed for more than a decade, resulting in many de facto standards and best practices.  This document is an attempt to codify, and thus clarify, the ways that both providers and consumers of these feedback mechanisms intend to use the feedback, describing some already common industry practices.</t><t>This document is the result of cooperative efforts within the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group, a trade organization separate from the IETF.  The original MAAWG document upon which this document is based was published in April, 2010.  This document does not represent the consensus of the IETF; rather it is being published as an Informational RFC to make it widely available to the Internet community and simplify reference to this material from IETF work. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
