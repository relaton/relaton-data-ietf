<abstract><t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed for neighbor's address resolution, unreachability detection, address autoconfiguration, router advertisement and solicitation.  With the progress of Internet adoption on various industries including home, wireless and machine-to-machine communications, there is a desire for optimizing legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol to be more efficient in terms of number of signaling messages in the network. Efficient IPv6 Neighbor Discovery is useful for energy-efficient networks and as well for overlay networks such as VLANs with large number of nodes.  This document describes a method of optimizations by reducing periodic multicast messages, frequent Neighbor Solicitation messages and discusses interoperability with legacy IPv6 nodes.  It also addresses the ND denial of service issues by introducing node Registration procedure.</t></abstract>
