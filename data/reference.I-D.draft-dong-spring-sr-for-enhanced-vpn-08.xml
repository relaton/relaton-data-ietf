<abstract><t>This document describes the mechanism to associate Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs) with network resource attributes.  The resource- aware SIDs retain their original functionality, with the additional semantics of identifying the set of network resources available for the packet processing action.  These SIDs can be used to build SR paths with reserved network resources.  In addition, these SID can also be used to build SR based virtual networks, which provide the network topology and resource attributes required by particular services.  The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</t></abstract>
