<abstract><t>Diffserv-Aware Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) can be used by Service Providers to perform fine grain bandwidth management of a subset, or sub-pool, of traffic flows. Typically in DS-TE a diffserv class will use a single Label Switch Path (LSP) that satisfies the bandwidth required. Where traffic with different diffserv characteristics must be mapped to a single LSP. Multi-Class DS-TE can be used to select an LSP that satisfy the bandwidth requirement of all classes required.  This document specifies the PCEP extentions to support Multi-Class Type DS-TE where path computation is performed with the aid of a Path Computation Element (PCE).</t></abstract>
