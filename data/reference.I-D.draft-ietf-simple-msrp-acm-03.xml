<abstract><t>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs, which uses COMEDIA in order to create the MSRP transport connection. The model allows MSRP UAs behind NATs to negotiate which UA will initiate the establishment of the TCP connection, in order for MSRP messages to traverse the NAT.  The document also defines how an MSRP UA which is located behind a NAT keeps the NAT binding alive.</t></abstract>
