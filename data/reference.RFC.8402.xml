<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called &quot;segments&quot;.  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service based.  A segment can have a semantic local to an SR node or global within an SR domain.  SR provides a mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain.</t><t>SR can be directly applied to the MPLS architecture with no change to the forwarding plane.  A segment is encoded as an MPLS label.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as a stack of labels.  The segment to process is on the top of the stack.  Upon completion of a segment, the related label is popped from the stack.</t><t>SR can be applied to the IPv6 architecture, with a new type of routing header.  A segment is encoded as an IPv6 address.  An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header.  The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet.  The next active segment is indicated by a pointer in the new routing header.</t></abstract>
