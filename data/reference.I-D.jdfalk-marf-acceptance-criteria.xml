<abstract><t>All known Feedback Generators (the operators of complaint feedback loops) have some criteria for acceptance of requests to receive feedback.  This document is a review of such criteria, where publicly available.  It is intended to inform design decisions within the Mail Abuse Reporting Format (MARF) Working Group [MARF-WG], and likely will never advance beyond internet-draft status.  The information included herein was gathered from public web sites.</t></abstract>
