<abstract><t>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (where a domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems) has been identified as a key requirement.  This document specifies a procedure relying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to compute such inter- domain shortest constrained paths across a predetermined sequence of domains, using a backward recursive path computation technique.  This technique preserves confidentiality across domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managed by different Service Providers.</t></abstract>
