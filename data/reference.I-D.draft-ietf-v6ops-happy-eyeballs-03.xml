<abstract><t>When the IPv4 server and path is working but the IPv6 server or IPv6 path is down, a dual-stack client application experiences significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only client.  This is undesirable because it causes the dual-stack client to have a worse user experience.  This document specifies requirements for algorithms that reduce this delay, and provides an example algorithm.</t></abstract>
