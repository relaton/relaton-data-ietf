<abstract><t>The service binding revocation semantics are missing in Mobile IPv6 Specificaion [RFC-3775] and PMIPv6 [PMIP6-SPEC]. This document defines the semantics of the revocation of a mobile node registration binding, which could have been established using a Client Mobile IPv6 or a Proxy Mobile IPv6 signaling. The proposed revocation mechanism uses generic message properties which is applicable to Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6 and can be used by any two mobility entities. As an example, this mechanism allows local mobility agent, involved in providing IP mobility services to a mobile node, to notify the mobility access gateway of the termination of the mobile node registration.</t></abstract>
