<abstract><t>This document describes some practical usages of address selection policy distribution mechanism defined in another document. Address selection policies are originated by ISPs or by network administrators and are delivered to each end host. These policies are stored at end hosts in the form of default address selection policy table. This mechanism enables central control of address selection policy at end hosts, so it is essential or helpful in many cases, such as IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack environment and ULA and Global address parallel-use environment.</t></abstract>
