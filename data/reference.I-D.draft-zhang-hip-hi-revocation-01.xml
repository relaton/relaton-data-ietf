<abstract><t>This document mainly analyzes the key revocation issue with host identities (HIs) in the Host Identity Protocol (HIP), which has not attracted enough attention from the HIP community yet. As a key functionality of key management mechanisms, key revocation is critical for security systems especially which are expected to operate for a long period. Apart from that, this document also discusses the potential challenges that the designers of HI revocation mechanisms have to encounter and propose candidate solutions.</t></abstract>
