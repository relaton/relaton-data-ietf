<abstract><t>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for large-scale content delivery.  As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs.  There is a requirement for interconnecting standalone CDNs so that their collective CDN footprint can be leveraged for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to end users.  The Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been chartered to develop an interoperable and scalable solution for such CDN interconnection.  The goal of the present document is to outline the requirements for the solution and interfaces to be specified by the CDNI working group.  This draft is a work in progress and requirements may be added, modified, or removed by the working group.  Requirements Language  The key words "High Priority", "Medium Priority" and "Low Priority" in this document are to be interpreted in the following way:  o  "High Priority" indicates requirements that are to be supported by the CDNI interfaces.  A requirement is stated as "High Priority" when it is established by the working group that it can be met without compromising the targeted schedule for WG deliverables, or when it is established that specifying a solution without meeting this requirement would not make sense and would justify re- adjusting the WG schedule, or both.  This is tagged as "[HIGH]".  o  "Medium Priority" indicates requirements that are to be supported by the CDNI interfaces unless the WG realizes at a later stage that attempting to meet this requirement would compromise the overall WG schedule (for example it would involve complexities that would result in significantly delaying the deliverables). This is tagged as "[MED]".  o  "Low Priority" indicates requirements that are to be supported by the CDNI interfaces provided that dedicating WG resources to this work does not prevent addressing "High Priority" and "Medium Priority" requirements and that attempting to meet this requirement would not compromise the overall WG schedule.  This is tagged as "[LOW]".</t></abstract>
