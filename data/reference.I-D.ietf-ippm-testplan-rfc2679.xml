<abstract><t>This memo provides the supporting test plan and results to advance RFC 2679 on One-way Delay Metrics along the standards track, following the process in RFC 6576.  Observing that the metric definitions themselves should be the primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo describes the test procedures to evaluate specific metric requirement clauses to determine if the requirement has been interpreted and implemented as intended.  Two completely independent implementations have been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2679.  This memo also provides direct input for development of RFC 2679bis.</t></abstract>
