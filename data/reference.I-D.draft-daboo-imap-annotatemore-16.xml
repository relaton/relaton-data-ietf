<abstract><t>The METADATA extension to the Internet Message Access Protocol permits clients and servers to maintain "annotations" or "meta data" on IMAP servers.  It is possible to have annotations on a per-mailbox basis or on the server as a whole.  For example, this would allow comments about the purpose of a particular mailbox to be "attached" to that mailbox, or a "message of the day" containing server status information to be made available to anyone logging in to the server.</t></abstract>
