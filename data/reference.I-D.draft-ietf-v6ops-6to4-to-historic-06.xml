<abstract><t>Experience with the "Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds (6to4)" IPv6 transition mechanism has shown that the mechanism is unsuitable for widespread deployment and use in the Internet.  This document requests that RFC3056 and the companion document "An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" RFC3068 are made obsolete and moved to historic status.  It also recommends that future products should not support 6to4 and that existing deployments should be reviewed.</t></abstract>
