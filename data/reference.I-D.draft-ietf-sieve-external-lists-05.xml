<abstract><t>The Sieve scripting language can be used to implement whitelisting, blacklisting, personal distribution lists, and other sorts of list matching.  Currently, this requires that all members of such lists be hardcoded in the script itself.  Whenever a member of a list is added or deleted, the script needs to be updated and possibly uploaded to a mail server.  This document defines a Sieve extension for accessing externally stored lists -- lists whose members are stored externally to the script, such as using LDAP (RFC 4510), ACAP (RFC 2244), or relational databases.  ToDo  o  Should we add a mandatory-to-implement tag?  Ned suggests (and I  agree) that it might be good to add a registry of well-defined  strings that can be used instead of URIs, and define the initial  string "ab" to represent the user's personal address book.  o  Do we want to have the :list test set variables?  See Ned's  comments in the text.</t></abstract>
