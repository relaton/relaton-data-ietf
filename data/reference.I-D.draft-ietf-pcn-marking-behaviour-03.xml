<abstract><t>The objective of Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) is to protect the quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows within a Diffserv domain, in a simple, scalable and robust fashion.  This document specifies the two metering and marking behaviours of PCN-nodes.  Threshold- metering and -marking marks all PCN-packets if the PCN traffic rate is greater than a configured rate ("PCN-threshold-rate").  Excess- traffic-metering and -marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the amount marked equals the traffic rate in excess of a configured rate ("PCN-excess-rate").  The level of marking allows PCN-boundary-nodes to make decisions about whether to admit or terminate PCN-flows.</t></abstract>
