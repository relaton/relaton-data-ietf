<abstract><t>Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) files and the MUD URI that point to them are defined in RFC 8520.  This document introduces a new type of MUD file to be delivered in conjunction with a MUD file signature and/or to be referenced via a MUD URI embedded in an IEEE 802.1AR Secure Device Identifier (DevID).  A DevID is a device specific pub- key identity document that can be presented to other entities, e.g. a network management system.  If this entity is also a verifier as defined by the IETF Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture, this verifier can use the references found in the MUD file specified in this document in order to discover appropriate Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM), Endorsement Documents, or even globally suitable Remote Attestation Services (RAS).  All three types of theses resources are required to conduct RATS.  Hence, the MUD file defined in this document enables remote attestation procedures by supporting the discovery of these required resources or services.</t></abstract>
