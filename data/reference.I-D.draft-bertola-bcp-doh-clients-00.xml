<abstract><t>This document presents operational, policy and security considerations for the authors and publishers of client applications that choose to implement DNS resolution through any of the protocols that provide private, encrypted connections between the application itself and the DNS resolver.  As these protocols, depending on implementation choices and deployment models, may impact the Internet significantly at the architectural, legal and policy levels, the document records the current consensus on how these protocols should be used by applications, especially user-facing applications meant for mass usage by non-technical consumers.</t></abstract>
