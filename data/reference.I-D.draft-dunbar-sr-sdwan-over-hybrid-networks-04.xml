<abstract><t>This document describes a method for end-to-end (E2E) SD-WAN paths to traverse specific list of network segments, some of which are private networks which include SR enabled segments, some of which may be the public IP networks that do not support SR, to achieve the desired optimal E2E quality.  The method described in this draft uses the principle of segment routing to enforce a SD-WAN path' head-end selected route traversing through a list of specific nodes of multiple network segments without requiring the nodes in each network segment to have the intelligence (or maintaining states) of selecting next hop or next domain.</t></abstract>
