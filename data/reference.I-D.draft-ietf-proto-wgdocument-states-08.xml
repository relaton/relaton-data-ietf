<abstract><t>The IETF Datatracker tool will be enhanced to make it possible for Working Group (WG) Chairs to provide IETF participants with more information about the status and progression of WG documents than is currently possible.  This document defines several new states that may be used to describe the status of an Internet-Draft (I-D) that is associated with an IETF WG.  The first state can be used to describe an I-D that is being considered for adoption by a WG, and the last state describes an I-D that has been submitted to the IESG.  Appendix A describes the different states used by IETF Area Directors (ADs) to describe the status of I-Ds that have been sent to the IESG for evaluation and publication.</t></abstract>
