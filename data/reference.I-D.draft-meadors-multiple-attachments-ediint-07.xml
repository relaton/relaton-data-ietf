<abstract><t>The EDIINT AS1, AS2 and AS3 message were designed specifically for the transport of EDI documents. Since multiple interchanges could be placed within a single EDI document, there was not a need for sending multiple EDI documents in a single message. As adoption of EDI-INT grew, other uses developed aside from single EDI document transport. Some transactions required multiple attachments to be interpreted together and stored in a single message. This informational draft describes how multiple documents, including non-EDI payloads, can be attached and transmitted in a single EDI-INT transport message. The attachments are stored within the MIME Multipart/Related structure. A minimal list of content-types to be supported as attachments is provided.</t></abstract>
