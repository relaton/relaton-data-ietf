<abstract><t>As the number of operational use cases of BGP grows there is demand to increase the level of separation and processing independence between various address families carried by BGP today.  This document augments base BGP specification in allowing local configuration of BGP port number by the operator to run parallel fully disjoined BGP instances allowing full processing separation between them.  While local BGP implementation may already assure BGP process or thread robustnes the general aim here is to allow similar level of groups of BGP address families independence when running BGP code on general purpose hardware as well as x86 based route reflectors.</t></abstract>
