<abstract><t>Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, public sector, and cloud service providers today in order to both complement and augment host-based security solutions.  TLS 1.3 introduces several changes to TLS 1.2 with a goal to improve the overall security and privacy provided by TLS.  However some of these changes have a negative impact on network-based security solutions.  While this may be viewed as a feature, there are several real-life use case scenarios that are not easily solved without such network-based security solutions.  In this document, we identify the TLS 1.3 changes that may impact network-based security solutions and provide a set of use case scenarios that are not easily solved without such solutions.</t></abstract>
