<abstract><t>The Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm shifts the focus of networking from providing connections between hosts to efficiently providing content to the users.  The work on ICN has traditionally been performed looking at "clean-slate" solutions which aims to replace IP with a new paradigm.  On the other hand, in this memo we propose an "integration" approach to Information Centric Networking, i.e. we extend the IP protocol suite by defining a new IP Protocol type (CONET).  Then we propose two ways of carring ICN related information in IP packets, one uses a new IP Option (both for IPv4 and IPv6), the other one only relies on the IP payload.  The ICN related information is used by network nodes and end nodes to support networking based on content rather than (or better in addition to) end-point addresses.</t></abstract>
