<abstract><t>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) is deployed in providers' core networks.  As providers plan to grow these networks, they need to understand whether existing protocols and implementations can support the network sizes that they are planning.</t><t>This document presents an analysis of some of the scaling concerns for the number of Label Switching Paths (LSPs) in MPLS-TE core networks, and examines the value of two techniques (LSP hierarchies and multipoint-to-point LSPs) for improving scaling.  The intention is to motivate the development of appropriate deployment techniques and protocol extensions to enable the application of MPLS-TE in large networks.</t><t>This document only considers the question of achieving scalability for the support of point-to-point MPLS-TE LSPs.  Point-to-multipoint MPLS-TE LSPs are for future study.  This memo provides information  for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
