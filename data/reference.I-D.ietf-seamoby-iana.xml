<abstract><t>Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery protocol and Context Transfer Protocol are experimental protocols designed to accelerate IP handover between wireless access routers. These protocols require IANA allocations for ICMP type and options, SCTP Payload Protocol Identifiers, port numbers, and registries for certain formatted message options. This document contains instructions to IANA about what allocations are required for the Seamoby protocols. The ICMP subtype extension format for Seamoby has additionally designed so that it can be utilized by other experimental mobility protocols, and the SCTP port number is also available for other experimental mobility protocols.</t></abstract>
