<abstract><t>This document proposes a modification to the 6rd deployment model for IPv6.  The basic 6rd model allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd requires support by a device (the 6rd CE) on the customer site, which must also be assigned an IPv4 address.  The alternative model described in this document uses tunnels from operator-owned "6rd Gateways" collocated with the operator's IPv4 network edge.  The tunnels may be provisioned or automatic.  The advantages of this approach are that it requires no modification to customer equipment and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.  It also allows the 6rd prefix portion of the prefixes delegated to customer devices to be longer than can generally be achieved by basic 6rd.  The gateway initiated 6rd model reuses the protocol defined in RFC 5969.</t></abstract>
