<abstract><t>Over time Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic engineered networks may be migrated to use Generalized MPLS (GMPLS). This will allow the networks to benefit from many new features that have been added to the GMPLS protocols. Additionally, such migration will facilitate easy interworking of packet networks that are controlled by IP/MPLS-TE protocols and networks that are controlled by GMPLS protocols. During this migration phase MPLS and GMPLS capable elements will have to co-exist and interwork. GMPLS signaling and routing protocols are subtly different from the MPLS protocols and so interworking and migration strategies are needed. This document describes issues associated with interworking of IP/MPLS-TE networks and GMPLS-based optical networks. Then it describes possible migration scenarios, mechanisms to compensate for the differences between MPLS and GMPLS protocols, and how to apply those mechanisms in order to achieve migration from MPLS to GMPLS.</t></abstract>
