<abstract><t>It is widely known that early media is an area within SIP in which the existing mechanisms within the protocol are not fully capable of handling to make rendering of these media flows a reliable process. Unfortunately, the need for media to be presented to an originator prior to the terminator answering is persistent. As such, a path forward to fixing this limitation is needed. This document seeks to document common ways that SIP networks handle early media, what side- effects those mechanisms have, and what the desired behaviors are. From this, it goes on to try to address as many early media issues as possible using as simple of a generic mechanism as possible.</t></abstract>
