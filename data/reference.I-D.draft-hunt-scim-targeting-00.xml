<abstract><t>The core SCIM 1.0 specification is intended to provide updates to a single cloud-based application. This extension specifies an extended API definition which allows a single SCIM endpoint to support updates to multiple cloud-based applications. These extensions enable network relationships such as proxy updates, and hub-to-hub-to-spoke relationships in addition to the hub-spoke relationship defined in the core SCIM 1.0 specification.</t></abstract>
