<abstract><t>This document extends the protocol identifier of SDP so that it could negotiate the use of IKE for media session in SDP offer/answer model. And it also specifies the method to generate VPN based on tunnel mode IPsec using self-signed certificate under the mechanism of comedia- tls. This document extends RFC 4572. In addition, it defines a new attribute "udp-setup", which is similar to "setup" attribute defined in RFC 4145, to enable endpoints to negotiate their roles in the IKE session.</t></abstract>
