<abstract><t>This document defines a MIME media type for representing and exchanging calendaring and scheduling information such as events, to- dos, journal entries and free/busy information. The definition of the text/calendar media type, known as iCalendar, is independent of any particular calendar service or protocol. This document is a product of the Calendaring and Scheduling Standards Simplification (Calsify) working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments on this draft are welcomed, and should be addressed to the ietf-calsify@osafoundation.org [1] mailing list.
