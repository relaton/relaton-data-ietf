<abstract><t>Multicast services such as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (eMBMS) become more and more popular in mobile networks.  In mobile transport network, it is important for the operators to provide efficient transport of multicast services with existing network devices.  This document describes a mechanism of using point- to-point Pseudowires (PW) [RFC3985] to achieve efficient layer 2 multicast transportation in mobile transport networks.The document gives a multicast method by utilizing a Point-to-Point (P2P) path between nodes in a packet transport network , according to the destination IP address.  With it, the PTN nodes can replicate and forward the service message, which are received from the multicast server, to the plurality of multicast clients corresponding to the destination IP address.</t></abstract>
