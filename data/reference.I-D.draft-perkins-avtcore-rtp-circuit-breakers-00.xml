<abstract><t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is widely used for telephony, video conferencing, and telepresence applications.  These applications are often used over best-effort UDP/IP networks.  If congestion control is not implemented then network congestion will deteriorate the user's multimedia experience.  This document does not propose a congestion control algorithm.  Instead, it specifies a minimal set of "circuit-breakers".  Circuit-breakers are conditions under which an RTP flow should cease to transmit media to protect the network from excessive congestion.  It is expected that all RTP applications running on best-effort networks will be able to run without triggering these circuit breakers in normal operation.</t></abstract>
