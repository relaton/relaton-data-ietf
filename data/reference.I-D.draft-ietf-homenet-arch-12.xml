<abstract><t>This text describes evolving networking technology within residential home networks with increasing numbers of devices and a trend towards increased internal routing.  The goal of this document is to define a general architecture for IPv6-based home networking, describing the associated principles, considerations and requirements.  The text briefly highlights specific implications of the introduction of IPv6 for home networking, discusses the elements of the architecture, and suggests how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home networking.  The architecture describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain additional functionality.  It is assumed that the IPv6 home network is not actively managed, and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack network.  There are no recommendations in this text for the IPv4 part of the network.</t></abstract>
