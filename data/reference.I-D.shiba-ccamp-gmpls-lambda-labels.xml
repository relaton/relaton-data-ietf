<abstract><t>Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a consequence new equipment providing lambda switching capability has been developed and is currently being deployed. RFC 3471 [RFC3471] has defined that a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) "only has significance between two neighbors". However, in a network composed of a new generation of lambda switch-capable equipment, this document explains new models that require standardization of the label. It highlights new operator requirements and describes signaling and routing extensions to satisfy those requirements. This document is a companion to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling. It defines the Label Switching Capable (LSC) technology specific information needed when using GMPLS.</t></abstract>
