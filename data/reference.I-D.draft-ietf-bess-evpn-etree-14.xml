<abstract><t>The Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) has defined a rooted-multipoint Ethernet service known as Ethernet Tree (E-Tree). A solution framework for supporting this service in MPLS networks is described in RFC7387 ("A Framework for Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) Service over a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Network"). This document discusses how those functional requirements can be met with a solution based on RFC7432, BGP MPLS Based Ethernet VPN (EVPN), with some extensions and how such a solution can offer a more efficient implementation of these functions than that of RFC7796, E-Tree Support in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS). This document makes use of the most significant bit of the "Tunnel Type" field (in PMSI Tunnel Attribute) governed by the IANA registry created by RFC7385, and hence updates RFC7385 accordingly.</t></abstract>
