<abstract><t>Client puzzles allow a TLS server to defend itself against asymmetric DDoS attacks.  In particular, it allows a server to request clients perform a selected amount of computation prior to the server performing expensive cryptographic operations.  This allows servers to employ a layered defense that represents an improvement over pure rate-limiting strategies.  Client puzzles are implemented as an extension to TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] wherein a server can issue a HelloRetryRequest containing the puzzle as an extension.  The client must then resend its ClientHello with the puzzle results in the extension.</t></abstract>
