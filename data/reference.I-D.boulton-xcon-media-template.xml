<abstract><t>The xcon framework[1] specifies the object model for centralized conferencing. The Conference Object, which is defined in the framework data model, comprises of two distinct components - the Common Conference Information and Conference Templates. This memo specifies the Conference Templates that describe various common conference scenarios. The templates define controls (and media properties like type of media supported, what streams are supported etc) through which participants of the conference can manipulate the media they receive from the conference server. This document provides a minimum set of media templates that can be instantiated during conference creation and manipulated during the life cycle of a conference instance. This draft is currently under major revision and should be considered a work in progress as it aligns with current technical direction of the Working Group. A revision of this draft will be submitted very soon. This work is being discussed on the xcon@ietf.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
