<abstract><t>This document describes the need for information in the email client whether the recieved email was send by telnet to a mail server by strangers and a way to configure the email clients to not to show such emails.Emails of financial importance should not be send using this method.SPAMMING is a distraction.If i get 10 SPAM for one authentic email, then i would not be able to pay attention to the authentic email.</t></abstract>
