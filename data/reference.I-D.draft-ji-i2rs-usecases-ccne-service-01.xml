<abstract><t>As network expand bridging access, Data Center and WAN, more networks have a central control point for the network elements in one administrative domain.  This document defines that network device as central control network element (CCNE).  The CCNE can be RR Router, PCE Server, or a federation of RR Router and PCE Server, or other devices.  This document describes use case where the CCNE can utilize both these the traditional functions and the programmatic Interface to Routing System (I2RS) to communicate with devices in the network. The I2RS use cases described in this document encompass: Control IP Network by RR Router, Control MPLS TE Network by PCE Server.  The goal of this document is to inform the community's understanding of how CCNE extensions fit within the overall I2RS architecture.  It is intended to provide a basis for the solutions draft describing the set of interfaces for the CCNE device.</t></abstract>
