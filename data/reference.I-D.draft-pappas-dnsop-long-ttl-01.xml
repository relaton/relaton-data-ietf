<abstract><t>Due to the hierarchical tree structure of the Domain Name System [RFC1034][RFC1035], losing all of the authoritative servers that serve a zone can disrupt services to not only that zone but all of its descendants. This problem is particularly severe if all the authoritative servers of the root zone, or of a top level domain's zone, fail. Although proper placement of secondary servers, as discussed in [RFC2182], can be an effective means against isolated failures, it is insufficient to protect the DNS service against a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS). This document proposes to mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks against top level DNS servers by setting long TTL values for NS records and their associated A records. Our proposed changes are purely operational and can be deployed incrementally. Our analysis shows that this simple operational tuning has a small impact on DNS performance but can significantly reduce the impact felt by client resolvers as a result of a successful DDoS attacks on the DNS service.</t></abstract>
