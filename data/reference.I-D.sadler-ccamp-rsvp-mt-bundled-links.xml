<abstract><t>When operating a multi-domain network, it is quite common for a domain to have a number of border-nodes that end up with a large number of connections between them using the same path.  While support for LSP stitching has removed the need to maintain the data associated with each end-to-end session (e.g. Sender Template and Session object data) within the domain, the mechanisms used by GMPLS RSVP-TE to support out-of-band signaling still force individual sessions to be used between the border nodes for each connection. This has a negative impact on intermediate nodes, as it increases the amount of RSVP processing and memory required.  This document details a method for GMPLS RSVP-TE to use a common session for an edge-to-edge LSP supporting multiple data-plane connections between border nodes.</t></abstract>
