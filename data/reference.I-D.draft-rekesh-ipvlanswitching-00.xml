<abstract><t>The objective of this document is to define and formalize the use of IP-based VLAN switching in the context of virtualization of network services. Networking infrastructure appliances may host multiple virtual instances of network services. IP address inspection on a packet coming from an external network such as the Internet can be used to switch the packet into a VLAN, through use of VLAN tags on Ethernet frames. The tagged frame is subsequently fed to a VLAN-aware networking infrastructure appliance where the packet is directed to a virtualized service instance. This method of IP-based VLAN switching on a packet assists in hosting multiple virtual instances of network services on servers and other appliances.</t></abstract>
