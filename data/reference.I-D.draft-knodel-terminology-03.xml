<abstract><t>This document argues for moving away from certain specific language conventions sometimes used by RFC authors and the RFC Production Centre in order to encourage the use of more inclusive terminology in Internet-Drafts that are work in progress, and in new RFCs that may be published in any of the RFC series.  The document also provides examples of inclusive terminology as precise alternatives for these conventions.</t></abstract>
