<abstract><t>During World IPv6 Day on June 8, 2011, several key content providers enabled their networks to offer both IPv4 and IPv6 services. Hundreds of organizations participated in this effort, and in the months and weeks leading up to the event worked hard on preparing their networks to support this event.  The event was largely unnoticed by the general public, which is a good thing since it means that no major problems were detected.  For the Internet, however, there was a major change on a short timescale.  This memo discusses measurements that the authors made from the perspective of an end user with good IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity.  Our measurements include the number of most popular networks providing AAAA records for their service, as well as delay and connection failure statistics.</t></abstract>
