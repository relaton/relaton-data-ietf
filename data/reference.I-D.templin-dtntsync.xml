<abstract><t>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model in which communications may be subject to long delays and/or intermittent connectivity.  DTN nodes include timestamps in the bundles of data they send so that correspondents can identify the bundles and determine the length of time they have been in the system.  However, there is currently no specified strategy for synchronizing the clocks between DTN nodes.  This document therefore presents a problem statement for time synchronization in DTNs.</t></abstract>
