<abstract><t>Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple paths to a regular TCP session.  Even though it is designed to be totally backwards compatible to applications, the data transport differs compared to regular TCP, and there are several additional degrees of freedom that applications may wish to exploit.  This document summarizes the impact that MPTCP may have on applications, such as changes in performance.  Furthermore, it describes an optional extended application interface that provides access to multipath information and enables control of some aspects of the MPTCP implementation's behaviour.</t></abstract>
