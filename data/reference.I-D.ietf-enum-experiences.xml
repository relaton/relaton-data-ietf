<abstract><t>This document captures experience in implementing systems based on the ENUM protocol, and experience of ENUM data that have been created by others.  As such, it clarifies the ENUM and Dynamic Delegation Discovery System standards.  Its aim is to help others by reporting what is "out there" and the potential pitfalls in interpreting the set of documents that specify the protocol.  It does not revise the standards, but it is intended to provide technical input to future revisions of those documents.</t></abstract>
