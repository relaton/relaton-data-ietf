<abstract><t>In highly dynamic, heterogeneous radio MANET environments where links are constantly changing, standardizing information exchange between the radio and router such that routers can make informed  routing decision based on link layer information over heterogeneous link types becomes a key area to address. This document defines the basic framework for radio-to-router interface communications as well as requirements and considerations for evaluating radio-to-router interface technologies for use in MANETs.</t></abstract>
