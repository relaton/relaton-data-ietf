<abstract><t>This document describes the experiences creating independent implementations of the Babel routing protocol [RFC6126], based on the two independent implementations currently available.  The Babel routing protocol is easy to implement, and it is quite feasible for someone with no prior experience with routing protocols to create a working implementation.  The few issues that needed clarification during the independent implementation work are documented, with the hope of aiding others seeking to implement Babel.</t></abstract>
