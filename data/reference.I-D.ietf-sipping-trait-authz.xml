<abstract><t>This document lays out a set of requirements related to trait-based authorization for the Session Initiation Protocol. While some authentication mechanisms are described in the base SIP specification, trait-based authorization provides information used to make policy decisions based on the attributes of a participant in a session. This approach provides a richer framework for authorization, as well as allow greater privacy for users of an identity system.</t></abstract>
