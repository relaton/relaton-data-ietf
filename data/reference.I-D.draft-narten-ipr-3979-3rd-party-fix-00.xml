<abstract><t>This document clarifies and updates a single sentence in RFC 3979. Specifically, when 3rd party IPR disclosures are made, the intention is that the IETF Executive Director notify the IPR holder that a 3rd party disclosure has been filed, and to ask the IPR holder whether they have any disclosure that needs to be made, per applicable RFC3979 rules.</t></abstract>
