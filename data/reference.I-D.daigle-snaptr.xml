<abstract><t>This memo defines a generalized mechanism for application service naming that allows service location without relying on rigid domain naming conventions (so-called name hacks). The proposal defines a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application to map domain name, application service name, and application protocol to target server and port, dynamically. [Note to be removed for RFC publication: this work was originally referred to as "napstr", and draft-daigle-napstr-04 is the immediate precursor of draft-daigle-snaptr-00.]</t></abstract>
