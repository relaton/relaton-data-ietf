<abstract><t>This memo examines the applicability of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to the control of wavelength switched optical networks. In particular we investigate how WDM based systems consisting of tunable laser transmitters and reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADM) or Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS) can be controlled with the current GMPLS/PCE protocols. Minor protocol extension requirements are identified where necessary. The three cases of full wavelength conversion, no wavelength conversion, and limited wavelength conversion and their impacts on GMPLS signaling, GMPLS routing, and PCE communications protocol are discussed.</t></abstract>
