<abstract><t>This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP requests and responses.  It describes two new headers, Cookie and Set- Cookie, which carry state information between participating origin servers and user agents.  The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie proposal, but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that use Netscape's method.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
