<abstract><t>This document identifies problems that may result from the absence of formal coordination and joint development on protocols of mutual interest between standards development organizations (SDOs).  Some of these problems may cause significant harm to the Internet.  The document suggests that a robust procedure is required prevent this from occurring in the future.  The IAB has selected a number of case studies, such as Transport MPLS (T-MPLS), as recent examples to describe the hazard to the Internet architecture that results from uncoordinated adaptation of a protocol.</t><t>This experience has resulted in a considerable improvement in the relationship between the IETF and the ITU-T.  In particular, this was achieved via the establishment of the &quot;Joint working team on MPLS-TP&quot;.  In addition, the leadership of the two organizations agreed to improve inter-organizational working practices so as to avoid conflict in the future between ITU-T Recommendations and IETF RFCs.</t><t>Whilst we use ITU-T - IETF interactions in these case studies, the scope of the document extends to all SDOs that have an overlapping protocol interest with the IETF.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
