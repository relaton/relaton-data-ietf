<abstract><t>This document describes the Naming Delegation Architecture that makes IPv6 Home Network globally reachable with Names or Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN).  In this architecture, the Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) acts as the DNS Authoritative Server of the Home Network also called the Delegated DNS Server.  The Naming Delegation is configured between the Delegated DNS Server and the Delegating DNS Server managed by the ISP.  The use case considered in this document is an End User that subscribes its ISP a specific Delegated Domain for its Home Network. This document describes how the CPE automatically sets the Naming Delegation between the Delegating and Delegated DNS Server.  The Naming Delegation is requested by the CPE.  The CPE DHCP Client and the ISP DHCP Server exchange DHCP Options to properly set the Naming Delegation.  More specifically, the CPE DHCP Client (resp. the ISP DHCP Server) configures the DNS(SEC) Zones of the Delegated DNS Server (resp. Delegating DNS Server).  For the Delegating DNS Server, the necessary pieces of information required to set the Naming Delegation are the IP address of the Delegated DNS Server, and if DNSSEC is used, the Delegation of Signing Information.  For the Delegated DNS Server, the necessary information is the Delegated Domain associated to the Home Network.</t></abstract>
