<abstract><t>This document describes a Quality of Service model (QOSM), for networks that support the use of the Controlled load service over a Diffserv cloud using pre-congestion notification.  Ths is a technique to perform admission control in a Diffserv network by measuring the congestion level in a domain.  New flows are admitted only if the current congestion level is below the allowed threshold.  When the controlled load in a domain exceeds a certain threshold, the egress prompts the ingress to pre-empt certain flows.  This proposal is based on the proposal made by B.Briscoe et al., for the extension of RSVP to support the Controlled load service over a Diffserv cloud using pre-congestion notification.</t></abstract>
