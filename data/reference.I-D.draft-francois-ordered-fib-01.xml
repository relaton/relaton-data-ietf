<abstract><t>This draft proposes a mechanism to prevent transient loops during non-urgent topology changes by ordering the FIB updates on routers, in networks which use link state routing protocols. This mechanism can be used in case of graceful link shutdowns, metric changes and when a link is enabled. The mechanism can also be used in the case of link-state change of a set of links attached to one common node, e.g. a linecard removal. The solution can also be used in conjunction with a FRR mechanism which turns a sudden link failure into a non-urgent change, by ensuring a local protection of the link, if protection is ensured for all the prefixes that are reached via this link. After a non-urgent topology change, each router computes a rank that defines the time at which it can safely update its FIB. A completion message mechanism is also proposed in order to speed up the convergence process.</t></abstract>
