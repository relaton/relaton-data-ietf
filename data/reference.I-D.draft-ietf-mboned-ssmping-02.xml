<abstract><t>The ssmping protocol specified in this document allows for checking whether one can receive multicast, both Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) and Any-Source Multicast (ASM), as well as to obtain additional multicast related information. This protocol is based on an implementation of tools called ssmping and asmping.Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].</t></abstract>
