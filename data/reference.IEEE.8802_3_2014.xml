  <abstract><t>Ethernet local area network operation is specified for selected speeds of operation from1 Mb/s to 100 Gb/s using a common media access control (MAC) specification and managementinformation base (MIB). The Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)MAC protocol specifies shared medium (half duplex) operation, as well as full duplex operation.Speed specific Media Independent Interfaces (MIIs) allow use of selected Physical Layer devices(PHY) for operation over coaxial, twisted-pair or fiber optic cables. System considerations formultisegment shared access networks describe the use of Repeaters that are defined for operational speeds up to 1000 Mb/s. Local Area Network (LAN) operation is supported at all speeds. Other specified capabilities include various PHY types for access networks, PHYs suitable for metropolitan area network applications, and the provision of power over selected twisted-pair PHY types.</t>
