<abstract><t>It seems reasonable to suggest that, despite the huge variety of types of endpoints on the Internet, there are categories of similarity.  These categories are important because categories of endpoint devices may share particular advantages or limitations for endpoint security. This draft attempts to suggest a classification of endpoints as a foundation for further work on operational security. The goal is to identify classes of endpoints with similar characteristics. Those characteristics may lead to the discovery that the devices in a particular category share similar characteristics for endpoint security.</t></abstract>
