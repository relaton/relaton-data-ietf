<abstract><t>There are number of deployment scenarios where there is a need for a home agent to allocate the same private IPv4 address to multiple mobile nodes that it is serving.  A service provider hosting home agent service for enterprises, or for supporting some of the IPv6 transitioning solutions related to IPv4 address exhaust problem, a home agent may have to allocate the same private IPv4 address to multiple mobile nodes.  The Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 does not have such support.  This document specifies extensions to Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 for supporting overlapping private IPv4 address assignment support.</t></abstract>
