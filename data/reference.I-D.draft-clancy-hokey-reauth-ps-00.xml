<abstract><t>This document describes the Handover Keying (HOKEY) problem statement. Current EAP keying protocols are incapable of generic EAP-level re-keying and handoff, which causes often unacceptable latency to various mobility protocols. HOKEY plans to address these problems by implementing a generic mechanism to reuse derived EAP keying material for handoff.</t></abstract>
