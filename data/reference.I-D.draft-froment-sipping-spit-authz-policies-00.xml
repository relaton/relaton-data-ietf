<abstract><t>SPAM, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk, might be a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks. The responsibility for filtering or blocking calls can belong to different elements in the call flow and may depend on various factors. This document discusses mechanisms to establish policies to react on potentially unwanted communication attempts. These policies match a particular SIP communication pattern based on a number of attributes. The range of attributes includes information provided, for example, by the Session Initiation Protocol, SIP identity mechanism, SIP-SAML and SPIT-SAML. An important topic for investigation is to decide whether the problem is worth analyzing, the choice of a policy language for describing authorization policies and to provide a mechanisms to create and modify authorization policies that are stored in XML documents.</t></abstract>
