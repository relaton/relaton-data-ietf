<abstract><t>Over the last few years there has been significant development of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) replication mechanisms supporting a multi-master service model. While multi-master replication may be useful in some situations, the deployment of multi-master replication alters the standard LDAP service model in a manner which can be harmful. Specifically, the LDAP service model properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) would be lost. This memo discusses the LDAP service model, how multi-master replication alters the service model, and how this alteration is harmful to existing directory applications.</t></abstract>
