<abstract><t>This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures for the Diameter Network address and port translation Control Application (DNCA).  The DNCA allows per endpoint control of large scale Network Address Translators (NATs) and Network Address and Port Translators (NAPTs), which are added to cope with IPv4-address space completion. The DNCA allows external devices to configure and manage a NAT device - expanding the existing Diameter-based AAA and policy control capabilities with a NAT and NAPT control component.  These external devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a Network Access Server (NAS), or can be more centralized control plane devices such as AAA-servers.  DNCA establishes a context to commonly identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or server, and a large scale NAT/ NAPT device.  This includes, for example, the control of the total number of NAT bindings allowed or the allocation of a specific NAT binding for a particular endpoint.  In addition, it allows large scale NAT devices to provide information relevant to accounting purposes.</t></abstract>
