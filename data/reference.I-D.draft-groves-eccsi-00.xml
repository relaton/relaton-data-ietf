<abstract><t>Many signature schemes currently in use rely on certificates for authentication of identity.  In Identifier based cryptography, this adds unnecessary overhead and administration.  The ECCSI signature scheme described in this document is certificate-less.  This scheme has the additional advantages of low bandwidth and low computational requirements.</t></abstract>
