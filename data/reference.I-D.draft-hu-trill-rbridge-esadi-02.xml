<abstract><t>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops. TRILL supports the multi-pathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using the IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) link state routing protocol and encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a hop count.  The ESADI (End System Address Distribution Information) protocol is a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) scoped way that RBridge can communicate end station addresses to each other.  An RBridge announcing VLAN-x connectivity (normally a VLAN-x forwarder) and running the TRILL ESADI protocol can receive remote address information and/or transmit local address information for VLAN-x to other such RBridges.  This document updates RFC 6325, particularly the documentation of the ESADI protocol.</t></abstract>
