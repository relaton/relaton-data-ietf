<abstract><t>The base PMIPv6 protocol does not have adequate mechanisms to support advanced multihoming such as simultaneous usage of all interfaces of a mobile node (MN) to receive and transmit data packets associated with a given prefix allocated to MN, and allow flow based routing according to preference, rules, and policies set by the MN or network entity.  This memo highlights such advanced multihoming related issues when mobility of the multiple interfaced mobile node (MuIF MN) is purely managed by PMIPv6 mechanism.  It also highlights the issue of lack of simultaneous attachment support when the mobility of the MuIF MN is managed by PMIPv6 and CMIPv6 mechanisms.</t></abstract>
