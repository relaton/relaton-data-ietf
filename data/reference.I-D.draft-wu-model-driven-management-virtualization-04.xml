<abstract><t>Model-driven service and network management provides a programmatic and standard-based approach for representing (virtual) services or networks and configuration to the network device that are used to build and deliver the service.  Models can be used at various phases of service and network management life cycle such as service instantiation, service provisionning, optimization, monitoring, and diagnostic.  Also, models can be designed to automate network management and provide closed-loop control for the sake of adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and maintenance.  This document provides a framework that describes and discusses an architecture for service and network management automation with YANG modeling technologies.  An applicability of YANG data models to automation of virtualized network service is also investigated.  The document aims to exemplify an approach to illustrate the journey from technology-agnostic services to technology-specific actions.</t></abstract>
