<abstract><t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication methods.  This document defines an authentication method for EAP called EAP-IBAKE, that is based on the Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE).  The IBAKE method provides mutual authentication through the use of identity-based encryption.  In addition to mutual authentication this method also provides perfect forward and backwards secrecy.</t></abstract>
