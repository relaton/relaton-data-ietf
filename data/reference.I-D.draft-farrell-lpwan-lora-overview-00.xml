<abstract><t>Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless technologies covering different Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  The common characteristics for LPWANs are large coverage, low bandwidth, small packet and application layer data sizes and long battery life operation.  One of these technologies is LoRaWAN developed by the LoRa Alliance.  LoRaWAN targets key requirements of the Internet of things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility and localization services.  This memo is an informational overview of LoRaWAN and gives the principal characteristics of this technology in order to help with the IETF work for providing IPv6 connectivity over LoRaWAN along with other LPWANs.</t></abstract>
