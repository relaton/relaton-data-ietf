<abstract><t>The DANE specification [RFC6698] describes how to use TLSA resource records in the DNS to associate a server's host name with its TLS certificate.  The association is secured with DNSSEC.  Some application protocols can use SRV records [RFC2782] to indirectly name the server hosts for a service domain.  (SMTP uses MX records for the same purpose.)  This specification gives generic instructions for how these application protocols locate and use TLSA records. Separate documents give the details that are specific to particular application protocols.</t></abstract>
