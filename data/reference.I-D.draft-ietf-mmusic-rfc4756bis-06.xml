<abstract><t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) supports grouping media lines. SDP also has semantics defined for grouping the associated source and Forward Error Correction (FEC)-based repair flows.  However, the semantics that was defined in RFC 4756 generally fail to provide the specific grouping relationships between the source and repair flows when there are more than one source and/or repair flows in the same group.  Furthermore, the existing semantics does not support describing additive repair flows.  This document addresses these issues by introducing new FEC grouping semantics.  SSRC-level grouping semantics is also introduced in this document for Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) streams using SSRC multiplexing.</t></abstract>
