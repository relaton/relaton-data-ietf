<abstract><t>According to IPv6 operation in cellular networks, one prefix can only be assigned to one interface of a mobile node by an access router and different mobile nodes can't share a prefix.  Managing Per-MN interface prefixes is likely to increase the processing load at the access router.  Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique in which the access router offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes to an DHCPv6 server.  The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node to the DHCPv6 server.  The access router next advertises the prefix information to the mobile node with a Router Advertisement message.  When the mobile node hands off, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server.  We also describe how AAA servers can help in prefix delegation.</t></abstract>
