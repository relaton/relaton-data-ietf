<abstract><t>Home networks are becoming more complex.  With the launch of new services such as home security, IP video, Smart Grid, etc., many Service Providers are placing additional IPv4/IPv6 routers on the subscriber network.  This document describes a self-configuring home router that is capable of operating in such an environment, and that requires no user interaction to configure it.  Compliant with draft- ietf-homenet-arch, it uses existing protocols in new ways without the need for a routing protocol.</t></abstract>
