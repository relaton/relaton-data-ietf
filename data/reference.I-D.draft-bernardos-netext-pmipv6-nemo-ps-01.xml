<abstract><t>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).  PMIPv6 enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without changing the IP address.  Current PMIPv6 specification does only support the movement of hosts within the localized mobility domain.  A mobile network (commonly referred to as a NEMO, NEtwork that MOves) can also benefit from the network-based localized mobility support provided by PMIPv6, but in a limited way.  This I-D describes what can be done with current standardized protocols, and describes the problem statement of fully supporting network mobility in Proxy Mobile IPv6.  The goal of this document is to present the problem -- and the use cases where this problem is relevant to be solved -- to collect feedback from the community about the interest in working on this problem.</t></abstract>
