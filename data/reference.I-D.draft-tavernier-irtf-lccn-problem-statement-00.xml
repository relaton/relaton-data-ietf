<abstract><t>Operational procedures and protocols of today's communication networks typically use explicitly defined mechanisms and representations to reach the goals associated to their design. This practice results into numerous protocols having a restricted space for (self-)adaptability and sensitivity respective to their network context (e.g. network traffic conditions, failure conditions, etc.). On the other hand, a wide spectrum of learning and optimization techniques is available such that network could learn and optimize their behavior in the running context. This document describes the opportunities and challenges for a Learning Capable Communication Network (LCCN).</t></abstract>
