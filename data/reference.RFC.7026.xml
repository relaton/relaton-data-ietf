<abstract><t>The MPLS Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) is a generalization of the applicability of the pseudowire (PW) Associated Channel Header (ACH).  RFC 5586 defines the concept of TLV constructs that can be carried in messages on the G-ACh by placing them in the ACH between the fixed header fields and the G-ACh message.  These TLVs are called ACH TLVs</t><t>No Associated Channel Type yet defined uses an ACH TLV.  Furthermore, it is believed that handling TLVs in hardware introduces significant problems to the fast path, and since G-ACh messages are intended to be processed substantially in hardware, the use of ACH TLVs is undesirable.</t><t>This document updates RFC 5586 by retiring ACH TLVs and removing the associated registry.</t></abstract>
