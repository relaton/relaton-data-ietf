<abstract><t>This document describes a self-managed network identifying network problems during failures and repairing them.  Self-managed Network Element (sNE) architectures and Network Management System (sNMS) architectures for centrally and distributedly managed networks are described.  A hierarchy among repairing entities is defined.  An in- band message format for Metro Ethernet networks is proposed for the fault management communication.</t></abstract>
