<abstract><t>A number of Internet applications have integrated supplemental features into the Domain Name System (DNS) to support their operations.  Many of these features assist in locating the appropriate service in a domain, or in transforming intermediary identifiers into names that the DNS can process.  Proposals to incorporate more sophisticated application behavior into the DNS, however, have raised questions about the applicability and extensibility of the DNS.  This document explores the architectural consequences of installing certain application features in the DNS, and provides guidance to future application designers.</t></abstract>
