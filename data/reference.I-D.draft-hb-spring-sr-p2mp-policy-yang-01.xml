<abstract><t>SR P2MP policies are set of policies that enable architecture for P2MP service delivery.  A P2MP policy consists of candidate paths that connects the Root of the Tree to a set of Leaves. The P2MP policy is composed of replication segments. A replication segment is a forwarding instruction for a candidate path which is downloaded to the Root, transit nodes and the leaves.  This document defines a YANG data model for SR P2MP Policy Configuration and operation.</t></abstract>
