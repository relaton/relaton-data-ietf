<abstract><t>Bootstrapping refers to the process of creating state (typically security associations) between two or more entities based on a trust relationship between these two or more parties AND a trusted third party. Some work has been done in the area of bootstrapping in the IETF recently. So far, the focus was on creating security associations. This document aims to attach authorization information to the bootstrapping process.</t></abstract>
