<abstract><t>This memo discusses an extension to a Bridge Protocol to detect and disclose changes in heighbouring host address parameters in a Multi-Lan system of Ethernets.  The problem is one which is appearing more and more regularly as the interconnected systems grow larger on Campuses and in Commercial Institutions.
