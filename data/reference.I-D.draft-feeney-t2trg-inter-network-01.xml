<abstract><t>The breadth of IoT applications implies that there will be many diverse, administratively independent networks operating in the same physical location.  In many cases, these networks will use unlicensed spectrum, due to its low cost and ease of deployment.  However, this spectrum is becoming increasingly crowded.  IoT networks will therefore be subject to wireless interference, both from similar networks and from networks that use the wireless channel in very different ways.  High-density, heterogeneous wireless environments present formidable challenges for network coexistence.  The PHY and MAC layers are primarily responsible for defining how radios use the channel.  But higher layer protocols are also a party to adverse interactions between networks.  To date, there have been few performance studies that fully reflect this aspect of the future IoT operating environment, particularly with respect to protocol behavior and network-scale interactions.  This document describes key challenges for coexistence and highlights some recent research results showing the impact of protocol level interactions on network performance.  It identifies two opportunities for the IRTF T2TRG community.  The first is to define best practices for performance evaluation and protocol design in the context of network coexistence.  The second is to investigate the use of higher layer protocols to actively participate in managing network coexistence.</t></abstract>
