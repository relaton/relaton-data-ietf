<abstract><t>TRILL supports multi-access LAN (Local Area Network) links that can have multiple end stations and RBridges attached.  Where multiple RBridges are attached to a link, native traffic to and from end stations on that link is handled by a subset of those RBridges called "Appointed Forwarders", with the intent that native traffic in each VLAN (Virtual LAN) be handled by at most one RBridge. But when two trill campuses are connected through a LAN network, AF selection for each campus should be selected differently. This type of scenario occurs when two different TRILL Campuses are connected to single LAN and want access to common set of VLAN's.  The following paper is an attempt to handle such scenario.</t></abstract>
