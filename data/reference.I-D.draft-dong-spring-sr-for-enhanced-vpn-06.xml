<abstract><t>This document describes the mechanism to associate Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs) with network resource attributes.  The resource- aware SIDs retain their original functionality, with the additional semantics of identifying the set of network resources available for the packet processing action.  These SIDs can be used to build SID lists with reserved network resources, which can be used for many network scenarios.  One typical use case is to provide SR virtual networks with required network topology and resource attributes.  The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</t></abstract>
