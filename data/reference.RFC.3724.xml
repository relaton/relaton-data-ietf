<abstract><t>The end-to-end principle is the core architectural guideline of the Internet.  In this document, we briefly examine the development of the end-to-end principle as it has been applied to the Internet architecture over the years.  We discuss current trends in the evolution of the Internet architecture in relation to the end-to-end principle, and try to draw some conclusion about the evolution of the end-to-end principle, and thus for the Internet architecture which it supports, in light of these current trends.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
