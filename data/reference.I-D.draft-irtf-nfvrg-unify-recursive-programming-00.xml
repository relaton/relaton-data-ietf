<abstract><t>The introduction of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in carrier- grade networks promises improved operations in terms of flexibility, efficiency, and manageability.  NFV is an approach to combine network and compute virtualizations together.  However, network and compute resource domains expose different virtualizations and programmable interfaces.  In [I-D.unify-nfvrg-challenges] we argued for a joint compute and network virtualization by looking into different compute abstractions.  In this document we analyze different approaches to orchestrate a service graph with transparent network functions relying on a public telecommunication network and ending in a commodity data center.  We show that a recursive compute and network joint virtualization and programming has clear advantages compared to other approaches with separated control between compute and network resources.  In addition, the joint virtualization will have cost and performance advantages by removing additional virtualization overhead.  The discussion of the problems and the proposed solution is generic for any data center use case; however, we use NFV as an example.</t></abstract>
