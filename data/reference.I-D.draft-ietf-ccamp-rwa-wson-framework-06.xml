<abstract><t>This memo provides a framework for applying Generalized Multi- Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture to the control of wavelength switched optical networks (WSON).  In particular we provide control plane models for key wavelength switched optical network subsystems and processes. The subsystems include wavelength division multiplexed links, tunable laser transmitters, reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADM) and wavelength converters. In addition, electro-optical network elements and their compatibility constraints relative to optical signal parameters are characterized.  Lightpath provisioning, in general, requires the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) process. This process is reviewed and the information requirements, both static and dynamic for this process are presented, along with alternative implementation architectures that could be realized via various combinations of extended GMPLS and PCE protocols.  This memo focuses on topological elements and path selection constraints that are common across different WSON environments as such it does not address optical impairments in any depth.</t></abstract>
