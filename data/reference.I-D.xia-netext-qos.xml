<abstract><t>This document describes Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain through enabling differentiated services. When a packet is encapsulated in a mobile access gateway (or a local mobility anchor), the differentiated services codepoint (DSCP) field in the outer header is mapped to the priority of a mobile node, or the precedence of an application of the mobile node.  Intermediary routers between the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor, which forward the packet based on the outer header of the packet, prioritize the packet according to the DSCP value of the outer header.</t></abstract>
