<abstract><t>While DNS highly depends on cache, its cache usage of non-existence information was limited to exact matching.  This draft proposes the aggressive use of a NSEC/NSEC3 resource record, which is able to express non-existence of range of names authoritatively.  With this proposal, shorter latency to many of negative responses is expected as well as some level of mitigation of random sub-domain attacks (referred to as "Water Torture" attacks).  It is also expected that non-existent TLD queries to Root DNS servers will decrease.</t></abstract>
