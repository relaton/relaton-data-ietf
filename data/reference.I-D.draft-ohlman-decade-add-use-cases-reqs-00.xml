<abstract><t>So far, the intended scope of the DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) working group has mainly been focused on peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.  There are however many non-P2P-based application that could also benefit from in-network storage.  The target of DECADE should thus specify a protocol that is also suitable for generic applications with certain characteristics and not only P2P applications.  This document enumerates a number of requirements that should be considered during the design and implementation of this protocol.</t></abstract>
