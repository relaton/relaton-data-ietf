<abstract><t>BFD mechanism [BFD] was original designed to detect failures in communication with a forwarding plane next hop. BFD operates on top of any data protocol being forwarded between two systems. This document describes how to use the BFD mechanism for exchanging OAM Notifications (e.g. AC and PWs Notifications) between OAM domains, for P2P PWs (Single Hop PW, or Multiple Hop PW). This proposal is presented as an alternative to the LDP Status Mechanism described in [PW-CNTL].</t></abstract>
