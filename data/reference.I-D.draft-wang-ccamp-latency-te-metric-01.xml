<abstract><t>Latency is such requirement that must be achieved according to the SLA signed between customers and service providers, so mechanism is needed to collect, compute and identify the latency by signaling and routing protocol.  This document describes the requirement and method to compute and identify the latency by control plane in today's network which is consisted of packet transport network and optical transport network in order to meet the latency SLA of the customer.  This document also describes RSVP-TE signaling and OSPF routing extensions needed to support the computation and identification of latency.  These extensions are intended to advertise and convey the information of node latency and link latency as TE performance metric.</t></abstract>
