<abstract><t>This document specifies a framework for using existing, modified and potential new networking technologies as components to provide an enhanced VPN (VPN+) service.  The purpose is to enable virtual private networks (VPNs) to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services.  A network enhanced with these properties can form the underpinning of network slicing, but will also be of use in its own right.</t></abstract>
