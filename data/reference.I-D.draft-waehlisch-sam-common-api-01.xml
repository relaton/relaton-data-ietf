<abstract><t>Group communication services are most efficiently implemented on the lowest layer available.  However, as the deployment status of multicast distribution largely varies throughout the Intenet, globally operational group solutions are frequently restricted to using a stable, upper layer protocol controlled by the application itself.  This document describes a common multicast API that serves the requirements of data distribution and maintenance for multicast and broadcast on a middleware abstraction layer, suitable for transparent underlay and overlay communication.  It proposes and discusses mapping mechanisms between different namespaces and forwarding technologies.  Additionally, it describes the application of this API at gateways operating between current multicast instances throughout the Internet.</t></abstract>
