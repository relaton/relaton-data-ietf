<abstract><t>The establishment of Human Rights as a Service (HRaaS) has significant potential benefits. Although the generic expressions of human rights in legal instruments largely precludes definitive HRaaS specification, the establishment of a measurable objective is compelling in the global marketplace for internet capabilities made available to the public, including new virtualised NFV-SDN based implementations and protocols. This HRaaS draft provides a structured enumeration of human rights found in the principal global legal instruments against which standards bodies can evaluate their specifications, vendors can differentiate their offerings, and users can compare those offerings and make informed decisions.</t></abstract>
