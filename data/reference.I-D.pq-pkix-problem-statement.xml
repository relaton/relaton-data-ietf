<abstract><t>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography will come uncertainty about the strength of cryptographic primitives.  For example; when will RSA and ECC fall?  Are Lattice schemes as strong as we believe?  The cryptographic community is calling for hybrid schemes that combine classic and post-quantum crypto in ways that remain strong so long as at least one of the algorithms used remains strong.  This document defines the problem statement for digital signatures in PKIX-like protocols, and gives an overview of the general families of solutions.</t></abstract>
