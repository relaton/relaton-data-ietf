<abstract><t>This document defines a framework for transcoding with SIP.  This framework includes how to discover the need for transcoding services in a session and how to invoke those transcoding services.  Two models for transcoding services invocation are discussed: the conference bridge model and the third party call control model.  Both models meet the requirements for SIP regarding transcoding services invocation to support deaf, hard of hearing, and speech-impaired individuals.</t></abstract>
