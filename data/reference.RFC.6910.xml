<abstract><t>The &quot;completion of calls&quot; feature defined in this specification allows the caller of a failed call to be notified when the callee becomes available to receive a call.</t><t>For the realization of a basic solution without queuing, this document references the usage of the dialog event package (RFC 4235) that is described as 'Automatic Redial' in &quot;Session Initiation                            Protocol Service Examples&quot; (RFC 5359).</t><t>For the realization of a more comprehensive solution with queuing, this document introduces an architecture for implementing these features in the Session Initiation Protocol where &quot;completion of                          calls&quot; implementations associated with the caller's and callee's endpoints cooperate to place the caller's request for completion of calls into a queue at the callee's endpoint; when a caller's request is ready to be serviced, re-attempt of the original, failed call is then made.</t><t>The architecture is designed to interoperate well with existing completion of calls solutions in other networks.</t></abstract>
