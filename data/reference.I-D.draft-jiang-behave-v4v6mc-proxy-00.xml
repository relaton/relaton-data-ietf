<abstract><t>During the long co-existing period of IPv6 and IPv4, the interoperation between IPv6 network and IPv4 network is essential. Multicast services across IPv6 and IPv4 networks are also needed. Besides the multicast translation mechanism, this document describes a multicast proxy solution. The multicast proxy is deployed at the border of IPv6/IPv4 networks. It acts as a multicast leaf in the network that the data source locates. It also acts as a multicast source in other IP network. Without translation, it multicasts the data retrieved and cached from different IP network.</t></abstract>
