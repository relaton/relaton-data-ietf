<abstract><t>This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,    and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This is a    preliminary discussion of the Network Block Transfer (NETBLT) protocol.    NETBLT is intended for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data    between computers.  It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow    controlled, and is structured to provide maximum throughput over a wide    variety of networks.  This description is published for discussion and    comment, and does not constitute a standard.  As the proposal may    change, implementation of this document is not advised.  See RFC-998.</t></abstract>
