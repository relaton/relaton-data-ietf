<abstract><t>As the increasing use of DNSSEC and IPv6, there are more public evidence and concerns on IPv6 fragmentation issues due to larger DNS payloads over IPv6.  This memo introduces an simple improvement on DNS server by replying an additional truncated response just after the normal fragmented response.  It can be used to relieve users suffering on DNS latency and failures due to large DNS response.  An ATR Experiment was done to show how well it works and some operational issues are discussed in this memo as well.</t></abstract>
