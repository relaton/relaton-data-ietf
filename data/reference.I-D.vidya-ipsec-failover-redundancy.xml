<abstract><t>Recovering from failure of IPsec gateways or servers maintaining large numbers of SAs may take several minutes, if they need to re- establish the IPsec SAs by re-running the key management protocol, IKEv2. This draft proposes IPsec and IKEv2 SA storage and retrieval mechanisms to improve the recovery time after an IPsec gateway or server failure.</t></abstract>
