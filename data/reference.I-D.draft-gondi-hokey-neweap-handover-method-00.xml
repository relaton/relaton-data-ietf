<abstract><t>The increase in the use of different access networks which involves different mechanisms for authentication and access authorizations, demands the new mechanisms to roam at any time anywhere with low latency. To overcome this process we need new mechanisms where a user terminal roams in different access networks with low latency and  efficiently. There is a need for unified signaling mechanisms for choosing and accessing networks.  In this draft we have discussed some of the processes involved in network selection, mobility management, security management in detailed to perform handover. The Handover information is passed to home server using the new handover method using EAP proposed vice versa in this draft. Even though there are different mechanisms provide this support such as IAPP context transfer mechanisms for seamless mobility some of the instances like supporting different access networks, roaming in access networks etc is not considered. The proposed mechanism is interoperable with the existing procedures involving security authentication and mobility during roaming.</t></abstract>
