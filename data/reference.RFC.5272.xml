<abstract><t>This document defines the base syntax for CMC, a Certificate Management protocol using the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS). This protocol addresses two immediate needs within the Internet Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) community:</t><t>1.  The need for an interface to public key certification products and services based on CMS and PKCS #10 (Public Key Cryptography Standard), and</t><t>2.  The need for a PKI enrollment protocol for encryption only keys due to algorithm or hardware design.</t><t>CMC also requires the use of the transport document and the requirements usage document along with this document for a full definition.
