<abstract><t>RFC 3344 [2] contains no provision to allow a home agent to inform a mobile node that it needs to stop acting as the home agent for the mobile node. Dynamical Home Agent assignment [3] is designed for assigning a optimal home agent for mobile node, not for proactively notifying a mobile node to change it's home agent. This document specifies a new MIP4 control message that can be used between a home agent and mobile node to signal a mobile node that it should acquire a new home agent.</t></abstract>
