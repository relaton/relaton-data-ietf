<abstract><t>This document defines terminology and provides requirements relating to a Location-by-Reference approach to handling location information within SIP signaling and other Internet messaging. The key for a Location-by-Reference mechanism is the Location URI, which is a reference to a location, and is used by either an end-device or a middlebox to represent a location, and is used as a key by a dereferencing protocol to get a usable form of location. An example application for which the Location-by-Reference mechanism is used is emergency call routing with voice-over-IP (VoIP) and general Internet multimedia systems, where Internet protocols are used end-to-end.</t></abstract>
