<abstract><t>Somewhat over a decade ago, the IETF responded to a series of perceived problems with the then-IAB by restructuring the way in which the IAB and IESG were constituted and assigning all standards- approval and closely-related processes to the IESG. In retrospect, that decision has had serious downsides: among them are the observations that the IESG has become overloaded to the point that the role requires an unreasonable level of investment and that the intertwining of managing WGs and then reviewing and approving their products has led to confusion and the risk, and sometimes the appearance, of inherent conflicts of interest and abuses. This document proposes to re-separate the "steering" and "WG management" functions that were orginally the IESG's responsibility from the "final review and standards approval" roles and respecifies the standards approval process in that context. The general concepts outlined in this document have been discussed informally in the community for some time. This document is provided as a specific proposal to facilitate a focused discussion.</t></abstract>
