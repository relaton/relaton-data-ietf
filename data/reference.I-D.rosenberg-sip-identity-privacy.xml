<abstract><t>RFC3323 defines procedures for privacy in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). These mechanisms make use of a privacy service that resides in the network, which can remove identifying information from messages. Its approach to privacy was compatible with the identity mechanisms in RFC 3325, which defined the P-Asserted-ID header field. However, its approach does not work well with the new cryptographic- based mechanisms in draft-ietf-sip-identity. As such, this document proposes a new framework for user privacy in SIP.</t></abstract>
