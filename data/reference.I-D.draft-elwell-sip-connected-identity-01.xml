<abstract><t>Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming request, the UAS can have a different identity from that in the To header. This document provides a means for that UA to supply its identity to the peer UA by means of a request in the reverse direction and for that identity to be signed by an authentication service. The same mechanism can be used to indicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., because of some action in a PSTN behind a gateway. This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
