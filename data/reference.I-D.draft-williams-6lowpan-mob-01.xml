<abstract><t>The 6LoWPAN problem statement [RFC4919] provides for a goal that 6LowPAN devices have simple interconnectivity to other IP networks including the Internet.  Such interconnectivity means that a global reachability requirement to 6lowpan networks is part of the 6LoWPAN architecture.  Here the 6LoWPAN devices must be reachable by any corresponding node, independent of the current location.  The 6LoWPAN architecture also describes support for various topologies which require mobility support.  Architectural considerations and analysis for mobility is needed to ensure proper performance for these usage scenarios.  The architectural considerations for mobility may present unique challenges to the 6LoWPAN given their requirements for low memory and power constraints.  Hence it is best to have mobility as an architectural consideration upfront rather than an after thought in the development of 6LoWPAN milestones.  This document provides a mobility perspective to the 6LoWPAN sensor network architecture.</t></abstract>
