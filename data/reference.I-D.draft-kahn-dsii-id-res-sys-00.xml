<abstract><t>Identifier Systems have been in existence for many years and are in widespread use. An opaque identifier conveys essentially nothing about the information identified and must be converted into useful intermediate information, known as state information, before the information being identified can be accessed or used. An identifier that is can be processed by a system in the Internet to provide useful and actionable intermediate state information is said to be resolvable. Although there is ongoing discussion about the value of opaque versus non-opaque identifiers, we assume the existence of a minimal syntax structure for the identifier and also that the resolution mechanisms only knows about the minimal syntax of the identifier. In this document we introduce the notion of interoperability of identifier resolution systems as a key component for enabling interoperability of heterogeneous information systems more broadly, and discuss the role of unique persistent resolvable identifiers.  Terminology is proposed to facilitate this discussion and a set of use cases demonstrating the need for interoperability of resolution systems are included.</t></abstract>
