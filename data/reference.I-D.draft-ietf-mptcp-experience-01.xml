<abstract><t>This document discusses operational experiences of using Multipath TCP in real world networks.  It lists several prominent use cases for which Multipath TCP has been considered and is being used.  It also gives insight in some heuristics and decisions that have helped to realize these use cases.  Further, it presents several open issues that are yet unclear on how they can be solved.</t></abstract>
