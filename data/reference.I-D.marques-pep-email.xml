<abstract><t>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) propositions for email are based upon already existing email and encryption formats (i.e., PGP/MIME) and designed to allow for easy implementable and interoperable opportunistic encryption: this ranging from key distribution to mechanisms of subject encryption.  The goal of pEp for email is to automatize operations in order to make email encryption usable by a wider range of Internet users, to achieve wide application of confidentiality and privacy practices in the real world.  This document defines basic operations of pEp's approach towards email and two PGP/MIME formats (pEp Email Format 1 and 2) to provide certain security guarantees.  The proposed operations and formats are targeted to Opportunistic Security scenarios and are already implemented in several applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).</t></abstract>
