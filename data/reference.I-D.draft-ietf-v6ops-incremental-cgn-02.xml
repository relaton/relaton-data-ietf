<abstract><t>Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected. As IPv4 address exhaustion approaches, the IPv4 to IPv6 transition issues become more critical and less tractable. Host-based transition  mechanisms used in dual stack environments are not able to meet the transition requirements. Most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain host-based transition mechanisms. Carrier- Grade NAT (CGN) devices with integrated transition mechanisms can reduce the operational change required during the IPv4 to IPv6 migration or coexistence period.  This document proposes an incremental CGN approach for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 hosts while leaving much of a legacy IPv4 ISP network unchanged. It is suitable for the initial stage of IPv4 to IPv6 migration. Unlike NAT444 based CGN alone, Incremental CGN also supports and encourages transition towards dual- stack or IPv6-only ISP networks. A smooth transition to IPv6 deployment is also described in this document.  An integrated configurable CGN device and an adaptive Home Gateway (HG) device are introduced. Both HG and CGN are re-usable devices during different transition periods. It avoids potential multiple upgrades. It enables IPv6 migration to be incrementally achieved according to the real user requirements.</t></abstract>
