<abstract><t>Classic Internet transport protocols use a single source IP Address and a single destination IP Address, as part of the identification for an individual transport data flow. This is problematic for multihomed hosts and for mobile hosts, collectively needing 'multiaddressing' support. The basic goal, then, is to find a method for multiaddressing that makes the smallest possible change to the architecture and to current systems, while maintaining flexibility for different emerging solutions. This draft proposes a framework for methods for creating Common Endpoint Locator Pools that can be used by and among the proposed solutions.</t></abstract>
