<abstract><t>In draft-bryant-mpls-synonymous-flow-labels the concept of MPLS synonymous flow labels (SFL) was introduced and it was shown how they could be used to support RFC6374 loss measurements.  In draft-bryant- mpls-sfl-control the request, lifetime management and withdrawal of SFLs was described.  In this memo we show how these two protocols can be run over UDP to support the operation of RFC6374 in systems that do not support the Generic Associated Channel Label (GAL) (RFC5586).</t></abstract>
