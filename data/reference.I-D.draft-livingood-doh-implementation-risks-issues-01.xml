<abstract><t>The DNS over HTTPS (DoH) protocol is specified in RFC8484.  This document considers Centralized DoH deployment, which seems one likely way that DoH may be implemented, based on recent industry discussions and testing.  This describes that implementation model, as well the potential associated risks and issues.  The document also makes recommendations pertaining to the implementation of DoH, as well as recommendations for further study prior to widespread adoption.</t></abstract>
