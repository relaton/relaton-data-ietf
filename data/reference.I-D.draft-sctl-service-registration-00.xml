<abstract><t>The DNS-SD Service Registration Protocol provides a way to perform DNS-Based Service Discovery using only unicast packets.  This eliminates the dependency on Multicast DNS as the foundation layer, which has worked well in some environments, like the simplest of home networks, but not in others, like large enterprise networks (where multicast does not scale well to thousands of devices) and mesh networks (where multicast and broadcast are supported poorly, if at all).  Broadly speaking, the DNS-SD Service Registration Protocol is DNS Update, with a few additions.</t></abstract>
