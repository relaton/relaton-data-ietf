<abstract><t>In Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routers may limit them to maintaining, at most, a few routes.  In some configurations, it is necessary to use these memory-constrained routers to deliver datagrams to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) can be used in some deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g., the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or a few routers and forward the IPv6 datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing tables on memory-constrained routers.  This document specifies a new IPv6 Routing header type for delivering datagrams within a RPL routing domain.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
