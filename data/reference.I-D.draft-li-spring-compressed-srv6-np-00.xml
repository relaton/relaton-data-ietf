<abstract><t>Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane by leveraging a new type of Routing Extension Header, called Segment Routing Header(SRH).  However, the overhead introduced by SRH may be a challenge for the current hardware capability, which would have much effect on the forwarding performance and the payload efficiency.  This document defines a compressed SRv6 network programming mechanism in order to reduce the overhead of SRv6 by introducing the Compressed Segment Identifier(C-SID) and the Compressed SRH(C-SRH).  The C-SRH can be a new Routing Header or an enhancement of SRH, which is compatible with SRH well.</t></abstract>
