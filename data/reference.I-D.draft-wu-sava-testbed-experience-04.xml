<abstract><t>Since the Internet uses destination-based packet forwarding, malicious attacks have been launched using spoofed source addresses. In an effort to enhance the Internet with IP source address validation, we prototyped an implementation of the IP Source Address Validation Architecture (SAVA) and conducted the evaluation on an IPv6 network.  This document reports our prototype implementation and the test results, as well as the lessons and insights gained from our experimentation.</t></abstract>
