<abstract><t>This document describes in detail the WCOR ("Welcomed Correspondence", or WCor/WC for short) extension to ESMTP. "Welcomed Correspondence" is explained in detail in Internet-Draft draft-szego-wcor-overview-00.txt [WCor-Overview]. This extension is based on the standard SMTP "Service Extensions" described in RFC 1869 [RFC1869]. ESMTP extensions themselves are not formally described here. Welcomed Correspondence capabilities are identified by the X-WCOR (while this document is in draft state) and eventually the WCOR keyword (when and if accepted to standards state) in the ESMTP commands list presented by a compliant ESMTP server implementation in response to an EHLO greeting.</t></abstract>
