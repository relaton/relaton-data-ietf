<abstract><t>From a carrier perspective, the possibility of turning a permanent connection (PC) into a soft permanent connection (SPC) and vice versa, without actually affecting data plane traffic being carried over it, is a valuable option.  In other terms, such operation can be seen as a way of transferring the ownership and control of an existing and in-use data plane connection between the management plane and the control plane, leaving its data plane state untouched.</t><t>This memo sets out the requirements for such procedures within a Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) network.  This  memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
