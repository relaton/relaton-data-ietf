<abstract><t>This document defines an HTTP header that allows to partition a single origin as defined in RFC 6454 into multiple origins, so that the same origin policy applies among them.  The header introduced in this document allows the portal to specify that resources that appear to be from the same origin should, in fact, be treated as though they are from different origins, by extending the 3-tuple of the origin to a 4-tuple.  The user agent is expected to apply the same-origin policy according to the 4-tuple rather than the 3-tuple.</t></abstract>
