<abstract><t>Although the SIP History-Info header is the solution adopted in IETF, the non-standard Diversion header is nevertheless widely implemented and used for conveying call diversion related information in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling. This document describes a recommended interworking guideline between the Diversion header and the History-Info header to handle call diversion information.  In addition, an interworking policy is proposed to manage the headers coexistence.  The History-Info header is described in [RFC4244] and the non-standard Diversion header is described, as Historic, in the [draft-levy-sip-diversion-11]. Note to the RFC-Editor: The reference to this draft should be replaced by the Historic RFC reference (work in progress).  Since the Diversion header is used in many existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is needed.</t></abstract>
