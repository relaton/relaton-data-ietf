<abstract><t>Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user shared simulations, are becoming increasingly used for serious work in addition to the traditional uses of research and entertainment. Based on actual need identified by interaction with various customers when working on virtual world interoperability over the last four years, this draft summarizes the main interoperability functions required to satisfy those needs.  From these use cases, requirements for the MMOX virtual world interoperability charter can be derived.</t></abstract>
