<abstract><t>Peer-to-peer applications, such as file sharing, real-time communication, and live and on-demand media streaming use a significant amount of Internet resources.  Such applications often transfer large amounts of data in peer-to-peer connections.  However, they usually have little knowledge of the underlying network topology.  As a result, they may choose their peers randomly with respect to the underlying network topology or they may choose their peers based on measurements and statistics that, in many situations, may lead to suboptimal choices.  This document describes problems related to improving traffic generated by peer-to-peer applications. In particular, this document discusses issues which better-than- random peer selection based on network-layer information may raise.</t></abstract>
