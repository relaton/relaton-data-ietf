<abstract><t>This document describes a protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal for multimedia sessions established with the offer/ answer model. This protocol is called Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE). ICE makes use of the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol, applying its binding discovery and relay usages, in addition to defining a new usage for checking connectivity between peers. ICE can be used by any protocol utilizing the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).</t></abstract>
