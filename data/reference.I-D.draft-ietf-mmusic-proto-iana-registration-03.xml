<abstract><t>Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services.  The data transport is augmented by RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality.  The RTP specification [RFC3550] establishes a registry of profile names for use by higher-level control protocols, such as the Session Description Protocol (SDP), to refer to the transport methods.  This specification describes the following new SDP transport protocol identifiers for transporting RTP Media over TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/ SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'.</t></abstract>
