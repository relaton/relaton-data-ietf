<abstract><t>There is a growing requirement for network operators to support multi-address familiy routing and forwarding services across their backbone networks. In general this is accomplished by constructing a mesh of tunnels between the backbbone provider edge routers and then advertising reachability to prefixes through specific tunnels. This document defines a new subsequence address family identifier associated with a tunnel end-point information. This enables a single egress provider edge router to use the border gateway protocol as a scalable and efficient means to distribute its tunnel end-point information to many ingress provider edge routers. The result is that the mesh of tunnels is in place and packets can be forwarded through these tunnels based on advertised reachability.</t></abstract>
