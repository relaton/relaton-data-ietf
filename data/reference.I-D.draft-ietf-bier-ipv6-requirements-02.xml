<abstract><t>The BIER WG includes, in it's charter, work on developing mechanisms to transport BIER natively in IPv6.  This document is intended to help the WG with this effort by specifying requirements for transporting packets, with Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) headers, in an IPv6 environment.  There will be a need to send IPv6 payloads, to multiple IPv6 destinations, using BIER.  There have been several proposed solutions in this area.  But there hasn't been a document which describes the problem and lists the requirements.  The goal of this document is to describe the BIER IPv6 requirements, summarize the proposed solutions, and guide the working group in understanding the benefits, and drawbacks, of the various solutions and to help in the development of acceptable solutions.</t></abstract>
