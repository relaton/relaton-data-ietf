<author initials='E.' surname='Juskevicius' fullname='E. Juskevicius'><organization /></author>
<date year='2011' month='March' />
<abstract><t>This document specifies requirements for new functionality to be added to the IETF Datatracker tool to make it possible for Working Group (WG) Chairs and their Delegates to input and update the status of the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) associated with their WGs.  After these requirements are implemented, WG Chairs will be able to use the Datatracker to provide everyone with more information about the status and progression of WG I-Ds than is currently possible. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
