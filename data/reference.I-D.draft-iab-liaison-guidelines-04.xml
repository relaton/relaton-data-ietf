<abstract><t>Whenever the IETF decides to enter into a liaison relationship with another organization, such as a Standards Development Organization (SDO), a consortium, or an industrial forum, a liaison manager is appointed. The procedures used by the IAB to establish and maintain liaison relationships between the IETF and other organizations are described in RFC 4052 [RFC4052]. This document expands on the role of liaison managers and liaison representatives giving guidelines on their mandate and the expectations, tasks and responsibilities placed on them.</t></abstract>
