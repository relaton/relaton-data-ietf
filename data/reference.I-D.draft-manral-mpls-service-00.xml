<abstract><t>With more and more enterprises using cloud based services, the distances between the user and the applications are growing.  A lot of the current applications are designed to work across LAN's and have various inherent assumptions.  For multiple applications such as High Performance Computing and Electronic Financial markets, the response times are critical as is packet loss, while other applications require more throughput.  [RFC3031] describes the architecture of MPLS based networks.  This draft extends the MPLS architecture to allow for latency, loss and jitter as properties.  Note MPLS architecture for Multicast will be taken up in a future version of the draft.</t></abstract>
