<abstract><t>The Internet sometimes faces such scenario that: a set of customer networks are connected to a transit core who delivers messages for them, to communicate with each other; the massages from one customer network to another are tunneled to pass through the transit core. The tunnels are known as "softwires".  It has been described in [I-D.ietf-softwire-mesh-framework] .  The customer networks may also need to run IP multicast applications across the transit core.  This memo provides a PE-based multicast framework for IPv6 transition.</t></abstract>
