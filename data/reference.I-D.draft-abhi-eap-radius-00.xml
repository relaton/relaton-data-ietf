EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-MD5, EAP-SIM uses radius protocol for communication bewteen radius server and the client. These protocols are used in both Wireless network authentication and in IKEV2 authentication to establish VPN tunnel.  +----------+        +----------+        +----------+ |          |  EAPOL |  EAP     | RADIUS |          | |  EAP     |&lt;------>|  Server  |&lt;------>|  RADIUS  | |  Client  |  EAPOW |          |  (EAP) |  Server  | |          |        |          |        |          | +----------+        +----------+        +----------+  This draft presents the security protocol which can be used to establish the secure communication channel between the radius server and  pass through server.
