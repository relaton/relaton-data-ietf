<abstract><t>The use of multiple interfaces is foreseen to provide ubiquitous, permanent and fault-tolerant access to the Internet, particularly on mobile nodes which are more prone to failure or sudden lack of connectivity. However, Mobile IPv6 currently lacks support for such multihomed nodes. The purpose of this document is to detail all the issues arising through the operation of Mobile IPv6 on multihomed mobile nodes. A taxonmy is used to describe the different situations where a mobile node is multihomed. Issues are explained for each multihomed configuration (number of interfaces, number of Home Addresses or number of Care-of Addresses), and classified into general IPv6 issues, issues pertaining to the specification of Mobile IPv6, and issues related to the implementation of Mobile IPv6. It is not the intention of this document to imply that all issues must be solved in the short term.</t></abstract>
