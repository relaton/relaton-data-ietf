<abstract><t>Security requirements for SPEERMINT can be found in draft-ietf-speermint-requirements.  This document presents different security threats related to SPEERMINT, classifying them into threats to the Lookup Function (LUF), to the Location Routing Function (LRF), to the Signaling Function (SF), and to the Media Function (MF). Various instances of the threats are briefly introduced inside the classification.  Finally, existing security solutions for SIP and RTP/RTCP are presented to describe countermeasures currently available for such threats.  The objective of this document is to identify and enumerate SPEERMINT-specific threat vectors.  Further, the document intends to give guidance for implementers on selecting appropriate countermeasures, and on fulfilling the SPEERMINT security requirements specified in draft-ietf-speermint-requirements.</t></abstract>
