<abstract><t>This document presents an illustrative framework for providing fast reroute in an IP or MPLS network through encapsulation and forwarding to &quot;not-via&quot; addresses.  The general approach described here uses a single level of encapsulation and could be used to protect unicast, multicast, and LDP traffic against link, router, and shared risk group failure, regardless of network topology and metrics.</t><t>The mechanisms presented in this document are purely illustrative of the general approach and do not constitute a protocol specification. The document represents a snapshot of the work of the Routing Area Working Group at the time of publication and is published as a document of record.  Further work is needed before implementation or deployment.</t></abstract>
