<abstract><t>A Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is formed by the spontaneous association of wireless and mobile devices capable of communicating among them even when there is no networking infrastructure available. Several unicast Internet gateway mechanisms have been proposed within the IETEF MANET WG. However, the particular nature of the IP Multicast model poses some additional requirements which need to be satisfied by candidate solutions. This document aims at identifying the requirements that a multicast solution for MANET interworking with a fixed IP Multicast network should satisfy.</t></abstract>
