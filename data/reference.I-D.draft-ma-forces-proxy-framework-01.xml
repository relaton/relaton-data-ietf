<abstract><t>In the future, in order to cut CAPex and OPex, it is desirable to integrate traditional routers into ForCES-based NEs. However, some in-service traditional routers may not implement ForCES protocol directly due to their inherent reasons. This document describes a framework where some mechanisms are specified to satisfy the above requirement and some security implications are considered.</t></abstract>
