<abstract><t>In traditional telecommunication system, operators usually provide general and limited security protection service for users during access (e.g.  AKA in 3G/4G network).  Now, with the development of network virtualization technology, the physical network device is became a network function software which is running on virtual machine and the network functions can be flexible and elastic.  So operators can provide more flexible security function to users through network function.  In order to provide more flexible security function, an interface between operator's network and user should be needed.  The interface will be used to request/negotiate/allocate/ operate (Virtual) Network Security Functions from operator's network. This draft describes use cases for using the interface in operator's network environment.</t></abstract>
