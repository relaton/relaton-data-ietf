<abstract><t>This document specifies an extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for rapid network prefix and service discovery in vehicular networks. It is assumed that a vehicle or a Road-Side Unit (RSU) have an external network interface and their internal network.  The extended IPv6 ND called vehicular ND can support vehicle-to-infrastructure communications as well as vehicle-to-vehicle communications.  This document defines new ND options to allow a vehicle to announce the network prefixes and services inside its internal network to another vehicle or RSU.</t></abstract>
