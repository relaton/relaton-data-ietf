<abstract><t>Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCII characters and a fixed-width font.  However, there is sometimes a need to supplement the ASCII text with graphics or picture images. The historic solution to this requirement, allowing secondary PDF and Postscript files, is seldom used because it is awkward for authors and publisher.  This memo suggests a more convenient scheme for attaching authoritative diagrams, illustrations, or other graphics to RFCs.  It further proposes conventions for additional input and display formats, to improve readability.  This proposal is based on draft-rfc-image-files-00, by Braden and Klensin, and revises it as little as possible, while expanding the goals of the effort.</t></abstract>
