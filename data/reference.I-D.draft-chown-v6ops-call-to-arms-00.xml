<abstract><t>The Internet Society (ISOC) has declared that June 8th 2011 will be World IPv6 Day, on which organisations are being encouraged to test their production IPv6 deployment capability.  Many significant content providers and networks have stated they will take part. Given this date is likely to see more IPv6 traffic flowing across the Internet than has ever been seen before, it seems timely to issue a call to arms to review the status of ongoing open issues in IPv6 deployment.  In this discussion document we list identified issues in IPv6 operations that may give rise to observed problems on June 8th. The World IPv6 Day should also create an excellent opportunity to observe the behaviour and performance of IPv6; it is thus very desirable to have appropriate measurement tools in place.</t></abstract>
