<abstract><t>The MPLS-forwarding-layer in a core network is a shared resource. The MPLS FIB at nodes in this layer contains labels that are dynamically allocated and locally significant at that node.  For some usecases like upstream-label-allocation, it is useful to be able to create virtual private MPLS-forwarding-layers over this shared MPLS-forwarding-layer.  This allows installing deterministic private label-values in the private-FIBs created at nodes participating in this private MPLS forwarding-layer, while preserving the "locally significant" nature of the underlying shared 'public' MPLS-forwarding-layer.  This specification describes the procedures to create such virtual private MPLS-forwarding layers (private MPLS-planes) using a new BGP family.  And gives a few example use-cases on how this private forwarding-layers can be used.</t></abstract>
