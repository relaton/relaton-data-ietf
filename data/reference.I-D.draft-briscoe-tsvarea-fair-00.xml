<abstract><t>We were moved to write this memo because the applied research and standards communities in networking are using completely unrealistic and impractical fairness criteria. The issue is not whether they should use this or that allocation scheme; they don't even allocate the right thing and they don't allocate it between the right entities. We explain as bluntly as we can that sharing out flow rates (as TCP and many other popular fairness mechanisms do) has no intellectual heritage from any concept of fairness in philosophy or social science, or indeed real life. Comparing and controlling flow rates alone will never achieve fairness and should never again be claimed as a fairness mechanism for production networks. Instead, a realistic fairness mechanism must share out the `cost' of each users actions on others.</t></abstract>
