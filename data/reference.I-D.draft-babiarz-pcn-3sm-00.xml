<abstract><t>This document proposes metering and marking mechanisms for PCN- enabled nodes to label packets with pre-congestion information. The marker marks all PCN packets with an admission-stop (AS) codepoint if the PCN traffic rate on a link exceeds its admissible rate (AR) and when it exceeds its supportable rate (SR), it marks some of those packets exceeding SR with an excess-traffic (ET) codepoint. The flows with ET-marked packets will be terminated until the aggregate PCN traffic on the path decreases below its SR. This document proposes metering and marking mechanisms for these objectives.</t></abstract>
