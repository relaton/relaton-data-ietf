<abstract><t>This document defines the KangarooTwelve eXtendable Output Function (XOF), a hash function with output of arbitrary length.  It provides an efficient and secure hashing primitive, which is able to exploit the parallelism of the implementation in a scalable way.  It uses tree hashing over a round-reduced version of SHAKE128 as underlying primitive.</t><t> This document builds up on the definitions of the permutations and of the sponge construction in [FIPS 202], and is meant to serve as a stable reference and an implementation guide.</t></abstract>
