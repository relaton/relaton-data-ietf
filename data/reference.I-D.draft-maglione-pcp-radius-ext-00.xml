<abstract><t>Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to pre-configure a port on a NAT device, a firewall, etc., so that IP packets of applications initiated from network side can be "port forwarded" to the correct user.  PCP is a client-server protocol and the PCP client needs to be provisioned with the FQDN of the server.  In a broadband network, customer information is usually stored on a RADIUS server and DHC protocol is used to populate user's configuration information.  This memo proposes a new RADIUS attribute to carry the FQDN of a PCP server, such that while the PCP server information is configured on a RADIUS server, the information can be conveyed to NAS via RADIUS protocol, and the co-located DHCP/DHCPv6 server can then populate the information to PCP client.</t></abstract>
