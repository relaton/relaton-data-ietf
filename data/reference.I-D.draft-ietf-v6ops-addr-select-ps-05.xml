<abstract><t>One physical link can carry multiple subnets.  Moreover, we can use multiple physical networks at the same time in a host.  In that environment, end hosts might have multiple IP addresses and be required to use them selectively.  Without an appropriate source/ destination address selection mechanism, the host will experience some trouble in communication.  RFC 3484 defines default source and destination address selection algorithms, but the multi-prefix environment considered here needs additional rules beyond those of the default operation.  This document describes the possible problems that end hosts could encounter in an environment with multiple subnets.</t></abstract>
