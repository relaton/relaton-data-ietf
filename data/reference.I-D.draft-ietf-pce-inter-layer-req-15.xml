<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) controlled networks.  MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed from layered client/server networks. It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers. PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements.  Generic requirements for a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in RFC 4657, "PCE Communication Protocol Generic Requirements". Generic requirements for a PCE discovery protocol are presented in RFC 4674, "Requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery".  This document complements the generic requirements and presents detailed sets of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements and PCE discovery protocol requirements for inter-layer traffic engineering.</t></abstract>
