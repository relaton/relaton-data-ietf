<abstract><t>Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white space".  The concept of allowing additional transmissions (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is a technique to "unlock" existing spectrum for new use.  An obvious requirement is that these additional transmissions do not interfere with the assigned use of the spectrum.  One approach to using the white space spectrum at a given time and location is to verify with a database for available channels.  This document describes a number of possible use cases of white space spectrum and technology as well as a set of requirements for the database query protocol.  The concept of TV white spaces is described including the problems that need to be addressed to enable white space spectrum for additional uses without causing interference to currently assigned use.  Use of white space is enabled by querying a database which stores information about the channel availability at any given location and time.</t></abstract>
