<abstract><t>This document describes an algorithm to generate one-time password values, based on HMAC [BCK1]. A security analysis of the algorithm is presented, and important parameters related to the secure deployment of the algorithm are discussed. The proposed algorithm can be used across a wide range of network applications ranging from remote VPN access, Wi-Fi network logon to transaction-oriented Web applications. This work is a joint effort by the OATH (Open AuTHentication) membership to specify an algorithm that can be freely distributed to the technical community. The authors believe that a common and shared algorithm will facilitate adoption of two-factor authentication on the Internet by enabling interoperability across commercial and open-source implementations.</t></abstract>
