<abstract><t>This document describes a threat model for the Web PKI context in which security mechanisms to detect mis-issuance of web site certificates will be developed. The threat model covers both syntactic and semantic mis-issuance, using a taxonomy of threats starting with whether the mis-issuance was done by the CA maliciously or not; then whether or not the certificate was logged; and then whether the log(s) or monitor(s) are benign or malicious, whether the certificate subject is self-monitoring and whether a client is doing any checks.</t></abstract>
