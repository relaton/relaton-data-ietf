<abstract><t>Amongst other things the IANA manages port assignments for TCP, UDP, and SCTP protocols. This document specifies the procedure by which those assignments take place. The distinction between so-called "well known ports" and other public static assignments is deprecated, the use of SRV records is encouraged, and documentation of port use is strongly encouraged.</t></abstract>
