<abstract><t>This document describes a two rate three color marker that has been in use for data services including Frame Relay services. This marker can be used for metering per-flow traffic in the emerging IP and L2 VPN services. The marker defined here is different from previously defined markers in the handling of the in-profile traffic. Furthermore this marker doesn’t impose peak rate shaping requirements on customer edge (CE) devices.</t></abstract>
