<abstract><t>Although the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3) is secure, operators and administrators have found that deploying it can be problematic in large distributions, due to a lack of integration between its User-Based Security Model (USM) and other authentication and user management infrastructure. This memo contains an evaluation of three proposals for an integrated security model for SNMP, and, based on these proposals, suggests how the ISMS (Integrated Security Model for SNMP) working group might move forward.</t></abstract>
