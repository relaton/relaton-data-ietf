<abstract><t>This document describes the Light Weight Access Point Handover Protocol (LWAPHP) which is a protocol allowing the access router to anchor and manage 802.11 handovers of the stations between a collection of wireless Access Points. The protocol like IEEE's IAPP aims to ensure that a station is connected to a single access point and provides an efficient context transfer mechanism during handover using neighbor graphs.</t></abstract>
