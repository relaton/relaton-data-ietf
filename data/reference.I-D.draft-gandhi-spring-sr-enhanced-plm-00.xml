<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm.  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  This document defines procedure for Enhanced Performance and Liveness Monitoring (PLM) in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses the probe messages defined in RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Light) as well as STAMP and is applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.</t></abstract>
