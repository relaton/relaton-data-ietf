<abstract><t>This document requests a DSCP from the IANA for a class of real-time traffic conforming to the Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior and admitted using a CAC procedure involving authentication, authorization, and capacity admission, as compared to a class of real-time traffic conforming to the Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior but not subject to capacity admission or subject to very coarse capacity admission. One of the reasons behind this is the need for classes of traffic that are handled under special policies, such as the non-preemptive Emergency Telecommunication Service, the US DoD's Assured Service (which is similar to MLPP), or e-911. These do not need separate DSCPs or separate PHBs that are separate from each other, but they need a traffic class from which they can deterministically obtain their service requirements from including SLA matters.</t></abstract>
