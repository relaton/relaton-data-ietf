<abstract><t>The Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) offers several authentication chemes, but many sites use redirection-based protocols to authenticate users.  Some servers are faced with a connundrum, having to choose between two mutually-exclusive options: redirect responses or 401 (authentication required) responses without knowing which the user-agent is most likely to support.  This document specifies a new HTTP request header, "Accept-Auth", that user-agents may use to indicate their authentication capabilities, including support (or not) for chasing redirects.  Also specified is a new HTTP authentication scheme named Redirect, operating via 3xx or 401 responses at the server's choice.</t></abstract>
