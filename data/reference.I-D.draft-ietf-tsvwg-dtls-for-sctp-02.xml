<abstract><t>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  The user of DTLS over SCTP can take advantage of most of the features provided by SCTP and its extensions, especially support of  o  multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.  o  dynamic reconfiguration of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  o  multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking.  o  unordered delivery.  o  dynamic reconfiguration of streams.  o  partially reliable data transfer.  However, the DTLS maximum user message size limit of 2^14 bytes applies also to DTLS over SCTP.  Since DTLS over SCTP uses the SCTP- AUTH extension, the DTLS user can not manage the keying material, since this is done by the DTLS layer.</t></abstract>
