<abstract><t>Routing protocols are designed to use cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate data being received from a neighboring router to ensure that it has not been modified in transit, and actually originated from the neighboring router purporting to have originating the data. Most of the cryptographic mechanisms defined to date rely on hash algorithms applied to the data in the routing protocol packet, which means the data is transported, in the clear, along with a signature based on the data itself.  These mechanisms rely on the manual configuration of the keys used to seed, or build, these hash based signatures.  This document outlines some of the problems with manual keying of these cryptographic algorithms.</t></abstract>
