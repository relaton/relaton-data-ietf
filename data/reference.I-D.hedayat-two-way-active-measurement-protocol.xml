<abstract><t>The IPPM One-way Active Measurement Protocol [OWAMP] provides a common protocol for measuring one-way metrics between network devices. OWAMP [OWAMP] can be used in both directions independently to measure one-way metrics in both directions between two network elements. However, it does not accommodate round-trip or two-way measurements. This draft proposes a Two-way Active Measurement Protocol, based on the One-way Active Measurement Protocol [OWAMP], that will accommodate two-way or round-trip measurements.</t></abstract>
