<abstract><t>Both WebDAV servers and clients frequently map URI-escaped characters inside a path segment to non-ASCII characters. These mappings can only be interoperable if there is a consensus about the appropriate character encoding. This document specifies a default encoding that is compatible with both the recommendations for URIs in HTML content and the "Internationalized Resource Identifiers" (IRI) specification. Furthermore, servers that implement a mapping to locally constrained names frequently do not support specific names, or silently map "similar" names to the same resource (for instance when content is stored in a filesystem that is case-preserving, but not case- sensitive). For these cases, discovery and error signalling features are defined.</t></abstract>
