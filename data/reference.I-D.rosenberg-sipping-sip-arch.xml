<abstract><t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and its many extensions and supporting technologies define a solution for multimedia communications on the Internet. Much of the design and architecture for SIP is based on a key set of architectural principles which, while commonly discussed on mailing lists and other forums, have not been explicitly captured.
