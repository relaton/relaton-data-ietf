<abstract><t>In Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6, one prefix can only be assigned to one mobile node by the home agent/ local mobility anchor (HA/LMA) and different mobile nodes can not share this home network prefix. Managing per-MN home network prefixes is likely to increase the processing load at the HA/LMA. Based on the idea that Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers as well as Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers can manage prefixes, we propose a new technique in which HA/LMA offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6/AAA server. HA/LMA requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node to the DHCPv6/AAA server. Based on this prefix, the mobile node can create a home address. When the mobile station leaves the network, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6/AAA server.</t></abstract>
