<abstract><t>This draft describes an example use of the RESTful CoAP protocol to control equipment in buildings such as HVAC and lighting.  A few basic design assumptions are stated first.  The uri structure is exploited to define multicast scopes.  RFC 3986 divides the uri in (1) a scheme, (2) an authority part, used here to locate the building under control, (3) a path, used here to locate the resource under control, and (4) a query and fragment part, only the query part is discussed in the context of service discovery.  This I-D supports the view that (1) building control will move in steps towards all-IP control networks building on the legacy efforts provided by DALI, LON, BACnet, ZigBee and other standards, and (2) the provision of a reliable group communication protocol is essential.</t></abstract>
