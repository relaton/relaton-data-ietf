<abstract><t>This document describes use cases that demonstrate the applicability of network data to evaluate the performance of wavelength division service.  The objective of this draft is not to cover the wavelength division service in detail.  Rather, the intention is to illustrate the requirements of network data used to evaluate the performance of wavelength division service.  General characteristics of network data and two typical use cases are presented in this document to demonstrate the different application scenarios of network data in wavelength division service.</t></abstract>
