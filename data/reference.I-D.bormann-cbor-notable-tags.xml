<abstract><t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.</t><t> In CBOR, one point of extensibility is the definition of CBOR tags. RFC 7049 and its revision 7049bis define a basic set of tags as well as a registry that can be used to contribute additional tag definitions [IANA.cbor-tags].  Since RFC 7049 was published, some 80 tag definitions have been added to that registry.</t><t> The present document provides a roadmap to a large subset of these tag definitions.  Where applicable, it points to a IETF standards or standard development document that specifies the tag.  Where no such document exists, the intention is to collect specification information from the sources of the registrations.  After some more development, the present document is intended to be useful as a reference document for the IANA registrations of the CBOR tags the definitions of which have been collected.</t></abstract>
