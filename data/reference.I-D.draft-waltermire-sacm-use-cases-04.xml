<abstract><t>This document identifies use cases, derived functional capabilities, and requirements needed to provide a foundation for creating interoperable automation tools and continuous monitoring solutions that provide visibility into the state of endpoints, user activities, and network behavior.  Stakeholders will be able to use these tools to aggregate and analyze relevant security and operational data to understand the organizations security posture, quantify business risk, and make informed decisions that support organizational objectives while protecting critical information.  Organizations will be able to use these tools to augment and automate information sharing activities to collaborate with partners to identify and mitigate threats.  Other automation tools will be able to integrate with these capabilities to enforce policies based on human decisions to harden systems, prevent misuse and reduce the overall attack surface.</t></abstract>
