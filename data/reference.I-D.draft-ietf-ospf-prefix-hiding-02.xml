<abstract><t>A transit-only network is defined as a network connecting routers only.  In OSPF, transit-only networks are usually configured with routable IP addresses, which are advertised in Link State Advertisements (LSAs) but not needed for data traffic.  In addition, remote attacks can be launched against routers by sending packets to these transit-only networks.  This document presents a mechanism to hide transit-only networks to speed up network convergence and minimize remote attack vulnerability.</t></abstract>
