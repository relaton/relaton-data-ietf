  <abstract><t>The purpose and content of all identified systems and software life cycle and service management information items (documentation) are specified in this standard.The information item contents are defined according to generic document types, as presented in Clause 7, and the specific purpose of the document (Clause 10).This International Standard provides a mapping of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008), ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013), and ISO/IEC 20000-2 (IEEE Std 20000-2:2013) clauses with a set of information items.This International Standard identifies records and information items based on analysis of references in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008), ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013) and ISO/IEC 20000-2:2012 (IEEE 20000-2:2013), which in some cases provide partial or complete outlines for the content of specific documents. However, the requirements for the life-cycle processes do not uniquely and unambiguously state the requirements for the information items contents or the information needed by a user of an information item. Moreover, the information from the life-cycle processes may overlap or may be created and revised at different times. In short, the analyzed references do not result in a logically complete list of information items.</t>
