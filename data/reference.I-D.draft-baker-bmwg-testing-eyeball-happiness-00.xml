<abstract><t>A barrier to the deployment of IPv6 is the amount of time it takes to open a session using common transport APIs in dual stack networks and networks with filtering such as proposed in BCP 38.  This note describes a test that can be used by a manufacturer or network operator to determine whether an application adequately meets the "happy eyeballs" requirements.  This test is not a test of a specific algorithm, but of the external behavior of the system as a black box. Any algorithm that has the intended external behavior will be accepted by it.</t></abstract>
