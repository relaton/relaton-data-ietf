<abstract><t>This document presents the RACK-TLP loss detection algorithm for TCP. RACK-TLP uses per-segment transmit timestamp and selective acknowledgement (SACK) [RFC2018] and has two parts: RACK ("Recent ACKnowledgment") starts fast recovery quickly using time-based inferences derived from ACK feedback.  TLP ("Tail Loss Probe") leverages RACK and sends a probe packet to trigger ACK feedback to avoid the retransmission timeout (RTO) events.  Compared to the widely used DUPACK threshold approach, RACK-TLP detects losses more efficiently when there are application-limited flights of data, lost retransmissions, or data packet reordering events.  It is intended to be an alternative to the DUPACK threshold approach in [RFC5681][RFC6675].</t></abstract>
