<abstract><t>This document provides a use-case and requirements that address the need for facilitating dynamic change of an operation plane, which includes virtually prepared multiple networks and/or data transmission paths, from a current operation one to a backup one during scheduled maintenance or an emergency such as a network disaster.  Specifically, the necessity of interfaces to establish consistent end-to-end data transmission paths over multiple domain networks is addressed.</t></abstract>
