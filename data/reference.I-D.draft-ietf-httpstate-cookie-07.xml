<abstract><t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers.  These headers can be used by HTTP servers to store state (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  Although cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers are widely used on the Internet.Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor)  If you have suggestions for improving this document, please send email to http-state@ietf.org.  Suggestions with test cases are especially appreciated. https://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpstate/</t></abstract>
