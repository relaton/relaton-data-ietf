<abstract><t>When a 'NAT traversal' capability is added to a class of signaling protocols which can control some traffic aggregation points, an attack based on a temporary access to the path followed by messages exists. Mobile IP [1] with NAT traversal [5] or IKE [2] with NAT traversal [6], including the IKEv2 [7] proposal, are potentially affected by this kind of attacks. This document claims this vulnerability is an intrinsic property of the NAT traversal capability, so is another point where the usage of NATs is very damaging.</t></abstract>
