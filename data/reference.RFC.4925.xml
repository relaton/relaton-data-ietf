<abstract><t>This document captures the problem statement for the Softwires Working Group, which is developing standards for the discovery, control, and encapsulation methods for connecting IPv4 networks across IPv6-only networks as well as IPv6 networks across IPv4-only networks.  The standards will encourage multiple, inter-operable vendor implementations by identifying, and extending where necessary, existing standard protocols to resolve a selected set of &quot;IPv4/IPv6&quot; and &quot;IPv6/IPv4&quot; transition problems.  This document describes the specific problems (&quot;Hubs and Spokes&quot; and &quot;Mesh&quot;) that will be solved by the standards developed by the Softwires Working Group.  Some requirements (and non-requirements) are also identified to better describe the specific problem scope.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
