<abstract><t>This document describes a non-standard, but widely implemented, modification to TCP's handling of ICMP soft error messages, that rejects pending connection-requests when those error messages are received.  This behavior reduces the likelihood of long delays between connection establishment attempts that may arise in a number of scenarios, including one in which dual stack nodes that have IPv6 enabled by default are deployed in IPv4 or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments.</t></abstract>
