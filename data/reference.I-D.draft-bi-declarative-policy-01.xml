<abstract><t>This document describes a declarative (also called intent based) policy model    to describe the user's intent on network policy. The intent policy model is a    specific data model specifies the desired state of the network system. It helps    the service management in Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) to model    the policy (a set of states described by constraints) that defines the final    results of a VPN service without specifying how it is monitored and managed during its lifecycle. One application for Distributed Data Center (DDC) scenarios with policy enforcement is provided with details of how to convert high level intent policy into lower level configurations.</t></abstract>
