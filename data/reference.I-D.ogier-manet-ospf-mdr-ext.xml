<abstract><t>This document describes an extension of OSPF-MDR which allows the option of using multipoint relays (MPRs) to select the MANET Designated Routers (MDRs), which form a CDS used for flooding LSAs. This extension allows each router to decide independently whether or not to select MPRs, so it provides additional flexibility without having to specify OSPF-MDR so that it either requires or prohibits MPRs. The use of MPRs in OSPF-MDR may provide some advantages (e.g., a CDS with a smaller stretch factor), although this may come with some costs in terms of overhead and/or response time. Simulations are planned to compare the performance of OSPF-MDR with and without MPRs.</t></abstract>
