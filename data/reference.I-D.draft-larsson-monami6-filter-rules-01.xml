<abstract><t>This document suggests a mechanism that could be used to control per- flow interface selection for communication to and from multi-homed nodes. A clear distinction is made between policies, filter rules and filters. In order to be able to use filter rules in a multi-access mobility context without excessive overhead, it is advantageous to be able to define filter definitions and bindings separately, as it is expected that it may be necessary to update the bindings much more often than the filter definitions.</t></abstract>
