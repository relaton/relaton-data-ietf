<abstract><t>The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) is a component of the IPsec architecture and is used to perform mutual authentication as well as to establish and to maintain IPsec security associations (SAs) between the respective parties.  IKEv2 supports several different authentication mechanisms, such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), certificates, and pre-shared secrets.  Diameter interworking for Mobile IPv6 between the Home Agent, as a Diameter client, and the Diameter server has been specified. However, that specification focused on the usage of EAP and did not include support for pre-shared secret based authentication available with IKEv2.  This document specifies IKEv2 server, as a Diameter client, to the Diameter server communication for IKEv2 with pre- shared secret based authentication.</t></abstract>
