<abstract><t>This document extends the integration of Mobile IP (MIP) and Multi- Protocol Label Switch (MPLS) with Layer2 Triggers (L2T) to expedite handoff and route optimization procedures. In the proposal, MPLS acts as only a fast second layer switch technique to setup a connection-oriented communication network, while MIP or IP acts as a signaling protocol to operate, administrate and manage MPLS network. L2Ts in this proposal are introduced to trigger signaling process of rerouting, extension and recovery of label switch paths (LSP) rather than to trigger registration or binding update of new care-of address (CoA), in traditional MIP. Moreover, in the proposed architecture, IP-in-IP tunneling is replaced by LSPs to support mobility, which reduces packet overhead thus mitigates network burden and makes it easy to support quality-of-service (QoS) or class-of-service (CoS). Therefore, the proposed scheme is well suited for time-constrained or delay-sensitive applications.</t></abstract>
