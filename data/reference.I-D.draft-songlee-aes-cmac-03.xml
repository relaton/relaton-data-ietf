<abstract><t>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has newly specified the Cipher-based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) which is equivalent to the One-Key CBC MAC1 (OMAC1) submitted by Iwata and Kurosawa. This memo specifies the authentication algorithm based on CMAC with 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This new authentication algorithm is named AES-CMAC. The purpose of this document is to make the AES-CMAC algorithm conveniently available to the Internet Community.</t></abstract>
