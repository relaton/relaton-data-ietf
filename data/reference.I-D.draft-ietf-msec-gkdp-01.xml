<abstract><t>This document specifies a group key distribution protocol (GKDP) based on IKEv2, the IPsec key management protocol; the new protocol is similar to IKEv2 in message and payload formats, and message semantics to a large extent. The protocol in conformance with MSEC key management architecture contains two components: member registration and group rekeying, and downloads a group security association from the GCKS to a member. This protocol is independent of IKEv2 except in its likeness.</t></abstract>
