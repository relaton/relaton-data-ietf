<abstract><t>When RBridges are connected by a bridge LAN link, they need to select out a Designated VLAN to be used for PDU exchange and TRILL data forwarding.  This document specifies an approach for RBridges to automatically determine a Designated VLAN on a LAN link for default configured RBridges. When a DVLAN has to be changed for the sake of a better connectivity of a LAN link, RBridges can change their Designated VLAN with least traffic interruption according to the soft Designated VLAN change method.</t></abstract>
