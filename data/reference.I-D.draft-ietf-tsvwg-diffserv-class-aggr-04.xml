<abstract><t>In the core of a high capacity network, service differentiation may still be needed to support applications' utilization of the network. Applications with similar traffic characteristics and performance requirements are mapped into diffserv service classes based on end- to-end behavior requirements of the applications as indicated by Diffserv Service Classes [5]. However, some network segments may be configured in such a way that a single forwarding treatment may satisfy the traffic characteristics and performance requirements of two or more service classes. In these cases, it may be desirable to aggregate two or more Diffserv Service Classes [5] into a single forwarding treatment. This document provides guidelines for the aggregation of Diffserv Service Classes [5] into forwarding treatments.</t></abstract>
