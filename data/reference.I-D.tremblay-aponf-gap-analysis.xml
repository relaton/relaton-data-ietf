<abstract><t>As operators struggle to optimize their network for different applications while maximizing network resources usage, there's growing business pressure to minimize operational tasks and the deployment time of new services.  New automation paradigms are meant to help reach these goals, including the optimization of network functions through application control.  This control could be signaled directly by an application, through a proxy or orchestrated in a centralized manner.  The current version of the Application-based Policy for Network Functions (APONF) proposed working group mentions the NSIS framework as a possible signaling protocol, through the definition of a new NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP).  The present memo analyses if this proposition is suitable for the designed purpose and if other protocols would be more suitable.</t></abstract>
