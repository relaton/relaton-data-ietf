<abstract><t>There is a common misconception that the IPv6 Addressing Architecture requires the use of only /64 subnet prefixes for subnet routing. This document clarifies the characterization of the relationship between IPv6 routing and the 64-bit boundary, which is that of a recommendation for the use of /64 subnet prefixes for subnet routing in most circumstances, not a requirement for such.  To further clarify the relationship, the document also provides operational guidance for the configuration of subnet prefixes and updates RFC 4291 accordingly.</t></abstract>
