<abstract><t>The Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSS-API) offers application programmers uniform access to security services atop a variety of underlying cryptographic mechanisms. This document updates the Java bindings for the GSS-API that are specified in "Generic Security Service API version 2 : Java Bindings" (RFC2853). This document obsoletes RFC2853 by making specific and incremental clarifications and corrections to it in response to identification of transcription errors and implementation experience. The note-worthy changes are in sections 4.12.1, 6.2.2, 6.3.2, and 6.8.1 of RFC2853, which are replaced by the sections 5.12.1, 7.2.2, 7.3.2, and 7.8.1 of this document, where numerical constants were either added or modified. The GSS-API is described at a language independent conceptual level in "Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1" (RFC2743). The GSS-API allows a caller application to authenticate a principal identity, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis. Examples of security mechanisms defined for GSS- API are "The Simple Public-Key GSS-API Mechanism" (RFC2025) and "The Kerberos Version 5 GSS-API Mechanism (RFC4121).</t></abstract>
