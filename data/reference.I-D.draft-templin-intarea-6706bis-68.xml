<abstract><t>This document specifies the operation of IP over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) interfaces using the Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) internetworking and mobility management service. AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links ND to IP forwarding.  Prefix delegation/registration services are employed for network admission and to manage the routing system. Multilink operation, mobility management, quality of service (QoS) signaling and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates.  Standard IP multicasting services are also supported.  AERO is a widely-applicable mobile internetworking service especially well-suited to aviation services, intelligent transportation systems, mobile Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and many other applications.</t></abstract>
