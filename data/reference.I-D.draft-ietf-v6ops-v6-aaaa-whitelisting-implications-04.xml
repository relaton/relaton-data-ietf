<abstract><t>The objective of this document is to describe the practice of whitelisting of DNS recursive resolvers in order to limit AAAA resource records responses, which contain IPv6 addresses, hereafter referred to as DNS Whitelisting, as well as the implications of this emerging practice and what alternatives or variations may exist. This practice is a type of IPv6 transition mechanism used by domains, as a method for incrementally transitioning inbound traffic to a domain from IPv4 to IPv6 transport.  The audience for this document is the Internet community generally, particularly IPv6 implementers.</t></abstract>
