<abstract><t>This memo recommends that RFC 4148, the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Registry be reclassified as Historic, and the IANA IPPM Metrics Registry itself be withdrawn from use.  The current registry structure has been found to be insufficiently detailed to uniquely identify IPPM metrics.  Despite apparent efforts to find current or even future users, no one has responded to the third quarter of 2010 call for interest in the RFC 4148 registry.</t></abstract>
