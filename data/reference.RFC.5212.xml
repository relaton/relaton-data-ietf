<abstract><t>Most of the initial efforts to utilize Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been related to environments hosting devices with a single switching capability.  The complexity raised by the control of such data planes is similar to that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks.  By extending MPLS to support multiple switching technologies, GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a multi-layered network of either a single switching technology or multiple switching technologies.</t><t>In GMPLS, a switching technology domain defines a region, and a network of multiple switching types is referred to in this document as a multi-region network (MRN).  When referring in general to a layered network, which may consist of either single or multiple regions, this document uses the term multi-layer network (MLN).  This document defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region / multi-layer networks and lists a set of functional requirements.  This memo  provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
