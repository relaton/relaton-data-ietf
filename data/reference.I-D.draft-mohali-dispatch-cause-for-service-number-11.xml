<abstract><t>RFC4458 defines a "cause" URI parameter, which may appear in the Request-URI of a SIP request, that is used to indicate a reason why the request arrived to the User Agent Server (UAS) receiving the message.  This document creates a new predefined value for the "cause" URI parameter to cover service number translation for cases of retargeting due to specific service action leading to the translation of a called service access number.  This document also provides a guidance for using the "cause" URI parameter within the History-Info header field because it was missing in RFC4458 whereas the combination of both is mandatory in some IP networks implementations.  This document updates RFC4458.</t></abstract>
