<abstract><t>Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may be established using signaling techniques described in [RFC4875]. However, [RFC4875] does not address many issues that comes when a P2MP-TE LSP is signaled in an inter-domain networks. Specifically, one of the issues in inter-domain networks is how to allow computation of a loosely routed P2MP-TE LSP such that it is re-merge free. This document provides a framework and required protocol extensions needed for establishing and controlling P2MP MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs in inter-domain networks.  This document borrows inter-domain TE terminology from [RFC 4726], e.g., for the purposes of this document, a domain is considered to be any collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility. Examples of such domains include Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) areas and Autonomous Systems (ASes).</t></abstract>
