<abstract><t>This memo presents requirements in the area of accounting and access control for IP multicasting.  The scope of the requirements is limited to cases that Authentication, Accounting and Authorization (AAA) functions are coordinated between Content Provider(s) and Network Service Provider(s). General requirements for accounting and admission control capabilities including quality-of-service (QoS) related issues are listed.  This memo assumes that these capabilities can be realized by functions implemented at edges of a network based on IGMP or MLD.  Finally, cases for Content Delivery Services (CDS) are described as application examples which could benefit from multicasting accounting and access control capabilities as described in the memo.  This memo defines requirements related to AAA issues for multi- entity provider models in which the network service provider and content provider cooperate to provide CDS and various related AAA functions for purposes such as protecting and accounting for the access to content and network resources.  The requirements are generally not relevant to cases in which there is not a reason to share AAA functions between separate entities.</t></abstract>
