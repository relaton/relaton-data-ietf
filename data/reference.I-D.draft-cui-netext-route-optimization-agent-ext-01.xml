<abstract><t>Route Optimization is a very useful feature in Mobile IPv6. Mobile node can communicate with correspondent node without the involvement of the home agent by Route Optimization. But there are some limitations to this feature. One problem is that the mobile node and the correspondent node must be capable for Route Optimization. This document introduces a Route Optimization Agent function used for Route Optimization and this extension mechanism can enable Route Optimization to be used between mobile node and simple IP node. In the extension solution, the Route Optimization Agent function may be implemented in LMA or MAG and the Agent entity can reflect the RO- related signal messages and fulfill the Route Optimization procedure on behalf of the simple IP node.</t></abstract>
