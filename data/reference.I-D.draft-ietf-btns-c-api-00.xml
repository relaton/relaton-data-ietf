<abstract><t>IPsec based security is usually transparent for applications and and they h have no common mechanism for gathering information about protected network connections and being aware of underlying security mechanisms. This document specifies an API that increases the visibility of IPsec to applications. The API allows applications to use the Stand-alone BTNS mode, control the channel bindigs, and control also other network security properties related to IPsec.</t></abstract>
