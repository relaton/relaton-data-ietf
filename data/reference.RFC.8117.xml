<abstract><t>Giving a hostname to your computer and publishing it as you roam from one network to another is the Internet's equivalent of walking around with a name tag affixed to your lapel.  This current practice can significantly compromise your privacy, and something should change in order to mitigate these privacy threats.</t><t>There are several possible remedies, such as fixing a variety of protocols or avoiding disclosing a hostname at all.  This document describes some of the protocols that reveal hostnames today and sketches another possible remedy, which is to replace static hostnames by frequently changing randomized values.</t></abstract>
