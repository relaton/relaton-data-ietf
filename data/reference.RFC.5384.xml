<abstract><t>A &quot;Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode&quot; Join message sent by a given node identifies one or more multicast distribution trees that that node wishes to join.  Each tree is identified by the combination of a multicast group address and a source address (where the source address is possibly a &quot;wild card&quot;).  Under certain conditions it can be useful, when joining a tree, to specify additional information related to the construction of the tree.  However, there has been no way to do so until now.  This document describes a modification of the Join message that allows a node to associate attributes with a particular tree.  The attributes are encoded in Type-Length-Value format.
