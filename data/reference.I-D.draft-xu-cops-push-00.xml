<abstract><t>COPS (RFC 2748) was originally designed for pull mode operation. The message exchanges for pull mode are efficient and support a close relationship between the protocol operations and state associated with particular events detected at the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP). The operation of push mode, as defined in COPS-PR (RFC 3084), is more awkward. Push mode involves extra messaging between the PEP and the Policy Decision Point (PDP) if one again wants to associate state arising from specific events (this time detected at the PDP) with specific protocol operations. This memo proposes to modify RFC 2748 to make push mode operation more efficient. Comments are invited on whether there are issues with the proposed solution.</t></abstract>
