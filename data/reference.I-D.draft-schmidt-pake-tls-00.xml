<abstract><t>This document describes how to integrate Password-Authenticated Key Agreement (PAKE) schemes into TLS.  These schemes enable two parties who share a potentially weak password to derive a common cryptographic key, allowing them to establish a secure channel.  The current document defines a generic way to integrate PAKE schemes into TLS.  In addition, it demonstrates how to use the well-known Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE) scheme in TLS as an example for the generic construction.</t></abstract>
