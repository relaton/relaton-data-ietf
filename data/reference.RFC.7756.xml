<abstract><t>This document describes an extension of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Internet Data Center Environments (SIIT-DC) architecture, which allows applications, protocols, or nodes that are incompatible with IPv6 and/or Network Address Translation to operate correctly with SIIT-DC.  This is accomplished by introducing a new component called an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, which reverses the translations made by an SIIT-DC Border Relay.  The application and/or node is thus provided with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity that provides end-to-end address transparency.</t><t>The reader is expected to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture described in RFC 7755.</t></abstract>
