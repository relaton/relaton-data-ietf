<abstract><t>Some service providers build and operate data centers that support over 100,000 servers.  In this document, such data centers are referred to as "large-scale" to differentiate them from smaller infrastructures.  The environments of this scale have a unique set of network requirements, with emphasis on operational simplicity and network stability.  This document summarizes ideas and experience of many people involved in designing and operating large scale data centers using BGP as the only control-plane protocol.  The intent here is to report a proven and stable routing design that could be leveraged by others in the industry.</t></abstract>
