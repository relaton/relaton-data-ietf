<abstract><t>This document is intended to provide an alternative perspective to the document prepared by Jim Fenton for DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), although it borrows from his substantial effort. This review removes emphasis on email-address domains, as DKIM allows signatures to be independent of the email-address. This document also considers the impact of adding an opaque-identifier and implementing abusive message replay abatement. This document considers threats against Internet mail and threats created when employing a signature-based method for establishing an accountable domain for a message, in particular DKIM. This document also ranks threat levels, modes of access, Bad Actors and their capabilities, and possible motivations for various attack scenarios.</t></abstract>
