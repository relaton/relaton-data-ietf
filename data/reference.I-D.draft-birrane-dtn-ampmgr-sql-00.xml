<abstract><t>This document describes a proposed public interface through which an application, such as a network management console, interacts with an Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP) Manager via a database supporting the Structured Query Language (SQL).  The use of SQL as an interfacing layer provides a natural way to describe interactions with an AMP Manager independent of a particular implementation of either the Manager or the application.  Specifically, this document presents a database schema capturing how to send controls to a Manager and how to accept reports received by a Manager from one or more AMP Agents.</t></abstract>
