<abstract><t>The common thinking for the last 10+ years has been to say that dual stack was the answer to v6 transition and that most things would be converted to dual stack way before we ran out of v4.  Well, it has not happened.  We are going to run out of IPv4 addresses soon, way before any significant IPv6 deployment will have occur.  As a result, broadband deployments now need to contemplate IPv6-only provisioning and NAT as a classic solution to maintain some form of connectivity between those environments and the legacy Internet.</t></abstract>
