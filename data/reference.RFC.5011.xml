<title>Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors</title>
<author initials='M.' surname='StJohns' fullname='M. StJohns'><organization /></author>
<date year='2007' month='September' />
<abstract><t>This document describes a means for automated, authenticated, and authorized updating of DNSSEC &quot;trust anchors&quot;.  The method provides protection against N-1 key compromises of N keys in the trust point key set.  Based on the trust established by the presence of a current anchor, other anchors may be added at the same place in the hierarchy, and, ultimately, supplant the existing anchor(s).</t><t>This mechanism will require changes to resolver management behavior (but not resolver resolution behavior), and the addition of a single flag bit to the DNSKEY record.
