<abstract><t>During discussions of a document to provide guidance on the use of addressing fields within the Resource Reservation Protocol Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling protocol used in Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS), it was determined that there was considerable variation in the implementation of options for the Explicit Route Object (ERO). Since there was a proposal to deprecate some of the options, it was felt necessary to conduct a survey of the existing and planned implementations. This document summarizes the survey questions and captures the results. Some conclusions are also presented. This survey was informal and conducted via email. Responses were collected and anonymized by the CCAMP working group chair.</t></abstract>
