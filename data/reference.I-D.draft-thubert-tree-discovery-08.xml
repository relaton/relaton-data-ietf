<abstract><t>This paper describes a simple distance vector protocol that exposes only a default route towards the infrastructure in a nested NEMO configuration.  The draft extends the Neighbor Discovery Protocol [RFC4861] in order to carry information and metrics which will help a Mobile Router select its Attachment Router(s) in an autonomous fashion and provides generic rules which guarantee that the interaction of different selection processes will not create loops.</t></abstract>
