<abstract><t>Cloud services are revolutionizing the way computational resources are provided, but at the expense of requiring an even more revolutionary overhaul of the networking infrastructure needed to deliver them.  Much recent work has focused on intra- and inter- datacenter connectivity requirements and architectures, while the "access segment" connecting the cloud services user to the datacenter still needs to be addressed.  In this draft we consider tighter integration between the network and the datacenter, in order to improve end-to-end Quality of Experience, while minimizing both networking and computational resource costs.</t></abstract>
