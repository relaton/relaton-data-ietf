<abstract><t>Documents intended to be shared among multiple constituencies must share a common format and transport mechanism. The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) defines a common XML format for document exchange. This draft outlines the SOAP wrapper for all IODEF documents and extensions to facilitate an inter-operable and secure communication of documents. The SOAP wrapper allows for flexibility in the selection of a transport protocol. The transport protocols will be provided through existing standards and SOAP binding, such as SOAP over HTTP(S) and SOAP over BEEP.</t></abstract>
