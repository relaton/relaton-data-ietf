<abstract><t>There are many deployment scenarios where an RSVP-TE LSP carries  multiple payloads. In these cases, it gets ambiguous on what  should value should be carried as L3PID in the Label Request  Object [RFC3209] or G-PID in the Generalized Label Request Object  Expires January 2009  [page 1]  draft-ali-mpls-sig-pid-multiplexing-case-00.txt  [RFC3471], [RFC3473]. The document propose use of some dedicated  PID values to cover some typical cases of multiple payload  carried by the LSP, including that indicates to the egress node  to ignore signaling to learn payload carried by the LSP.</t></abstract>
