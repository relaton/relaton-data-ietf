<abstract><t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) associates a "responsible" identity with a message and provides a means of verifying that the association is legitimate.  [RFC4871] DKIM defines a domain-level authentication framework for email using public-key cryptography and key server technology.  This permits verifying the source or intermediary for a message, as well as the contents of messages.  The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing domain to assert responsibility for sending a message, thus proving and protecting the identity associated with the message and the integrity of the messages itself, while retaining the functionality of Internet email as it is known today.  Such protection of email identity may assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing".  This document provides implementation, deployment, operational and migration considerations for DKIM.</t></abstract>
