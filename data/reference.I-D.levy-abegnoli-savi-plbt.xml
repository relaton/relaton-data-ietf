<abstract><t>Different documents [savi-fcfs] [savi-dhcp] [savi-send] propose different preference schemes to resolve binding entry collisions (same L3 address, different binding anchors) based of the address- assignment method that they cover.  For instance [fcfs] keeps the first entry and rejects others.  However, in heterogeneous deployments, all address-assignment methods co-exist, and there is a need for defining an algorithm that compare colliding entries across these different methods (and any other method not covered) to pick up a preferred one.  This document describes one such algorithum.</t></abstract>
