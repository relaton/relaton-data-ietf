<abstract><t>Summoning emergency help by the public is a core feature of telephone networks. This document describes how various IETF protocols and mechanisms are combined to place emergency calls. This includes how these calls are routed to the correct Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on the physical location of the caller, while providing the call taker the necessary information to dispatch a first responder to that location and to call back the caller if necessary. It describes at a high level how the pieces (recognizing a call as an emergency call, marking it as such, determining the location of the caller, routing the call based on location) go together, and references the Internet standards that define the details of these mechanisms.</t></abstract>
