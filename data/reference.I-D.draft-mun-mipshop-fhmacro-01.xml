<abstract><t>In Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), a mobile can experience a long handover latency and packet loss problems due to the MN's movement between access routers belonging to different Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) domain, called a macro mobility handover. To improve the performance of macro mobility handover, this document describes a new scheme that can execute the macro mobility handover rapidly and reduce both the handover latency and packet loss. The scheme described in this document is a fast macro mobility handover by applying FMIPv6 protocol to the edge access routers in MAP domain. The scheme supports two modes to be used according to the situation of the MN.</t></abstract>
