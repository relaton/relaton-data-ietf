<abstract><t>The size of the published presence information document may be large. As specified in "Event State Publication Extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)" a presence user agent publishes a full event state of presence information in every publication operation which modifies the current event state. This is done regardless of which presence information has been changed compared to the earlier publications.</t></abstract>
