<abstract><t>The latency associated with Mobile IPv6's Return Routability test can have an adverse impact on delay-sensitive applications. Early Binding Updates mitigate this issue by already using a new care-of address in parallel with testing it. We propose and analyze a credit-based mechanism that prevents misuse of Early Binding Updates for amplified flooding attacks and discourages such misuse for non-amplified flooding attacks.</t></abstract>
