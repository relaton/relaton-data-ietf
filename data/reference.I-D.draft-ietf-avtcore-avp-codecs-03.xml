<abstract><t>The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/ AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF).  This document updates RFC 3551, the RTP/AVP profile (and by extension, the profiles that build upon it) to reflect changes in audio codec usage since the document was originally published.</t></abstract>
