<abstract><t>A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the host operating system.  This semantic is available in all popular operating systems and is used in various protocol implementations. The Logical Interface support is required on the mobile node operating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging various network-based mobility management features such as inter-technology handoffs, multihoming and flow mobility support.  This document explains the operational details of Logical Interface construct and the specifics on how the link-layer implementations hide the physical interfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes on the attached access networks.  Furthermore, this document identifies the applicability of this approach to various link-layer technologies and analyzes the issues around it when used in context with various mobility management features.</t></abstract>
