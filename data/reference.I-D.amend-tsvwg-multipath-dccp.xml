<abstract><t>DCCP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers.  The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a DCCP session could improve resource usage within the network and, thus, improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failures.</t><t> This document presents a set of extensions to traditional DCCP to support multipath operation.  Multipath DCCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers.  The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as DCCP and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple DCCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.</t></abstract>
