<abstract><t>The RSVP model for communicating requests to network devices along a datapath has proven useful for a variety of applications beyond what the protocol designers envisioned, and while the architectural model generalizes well the protocol itself has a number of features that limit its applicability to applications other than IntServ. Network Layer Signaling is a modernized version that, among other things, is based on a "two-layer" architecture that divides protocol function into transport and application. This document describes the transport protocol.</t></abstract>
