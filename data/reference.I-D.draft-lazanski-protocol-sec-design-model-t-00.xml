<abstract><t>This document is a non-exhaustive set of considerations for protocol designers and implementers with regards to attack defence. These considerations can be used as an aid to analyse protocol design choice and in turn to help combat threats and defend users of these protocols and systems against malicious attacks.  First, we list well-known classes of attacks that pose threats, with relevant case studies and descriptions. Next, we give a list of defence measures against these attacks to be considered when designing and deploying protocols. Naturally, deployments of protocols vary greatly between use cases; therefore, some attacks and defensive measures outlined may require more consideration than others, dependent on use case.  This RFC can be used by protocol designers to write the Security Considerations section in an RFC. The impact on attack defence of a protocol should be considered in multiple use cases across the multiple layers of the internet in its this section. Defence against malicious attacks can be improved and it can be weakened by design features of protocols. Designers should acknowledge the role of protocols in attack prevention, detection and mitigation; this document aims to be a useful guide in doing so.</t></abstract>
