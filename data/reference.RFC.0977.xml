<abstract><t>NNTP specifies a protocol for the distribution, inquiry, retrieval, and    posting of news articles using a reliable stream-based transmission of    news among the ARPA-Internet community.  NNTP is designed so that news    articles are stored in a central database allowing a subscriber to    select only those items he wishes to read.  Indexing, cross-referencing,    and expiration of aged messages are also provided. This RFC suggests a    proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests    discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract>
