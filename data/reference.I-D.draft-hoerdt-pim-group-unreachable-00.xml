<abstract><t>Currently, PIM-SM is the most widely deployed multicast routing protocol in the Internet. However in IPv6 this multicast protocol lacks a simple connectivity debugging tool, making it difficult to identify multicast routing problems. When a host wants to receive a multicast group or channel, if the corresponding PIM-Join message cannot be propagated in the network, nothing exists to inform the receiver or the network about this failure. We propose a simple error notification message based on ICMP/ICMP6 which is able to indicate where and why the error happened in the network without using a multicast traceroute mechanism.</t></abstract>
