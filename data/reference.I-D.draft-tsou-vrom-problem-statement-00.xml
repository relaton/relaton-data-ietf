<abstract><t>The adoption of cloud computing brings a number of benefits but also a number of challenges to the data center operations.  Such challenges include automation and management of data center resources including servers, storage and networking elements.  In particular, this document describes the problem of operational and management challenges that virtualization brings in the (carrier) cloud data center as an enabler of new technologies such as self-provisioning and elastic capacity and related benefits of consolidation, reduced total cost of ownership, and energy management.  This document does not cover the problem of address resolution in massive data centers. It does not cover technologies related to VDI either.</t></abstract>
