<abstract><t>The Authorized Firewall Control Protocol provides an interface that allows network entities to request firewall and NAT services and resources. It is an instance of a protocol that provides authorizations and other security servcies, and interworks with other such instances. AFWC uses its authorization facilities to provide network administrators more control over network border admissions decisions than is provided by other firewall pinholing protocols.</t></abstract>
