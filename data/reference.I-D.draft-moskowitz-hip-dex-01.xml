<abstract><t>This document specifies the Host Identity Protocol Diet EXchange (HIP DEX), a variant of the HIP Base EXchange (HIP BEX) [rfc5201-bis]. The HIP DEX protocol design aims at reducing the overhead of the employed cryptographic primitives by omitting public-key signatures and hash functions.  In doing so, the main goal is to still deliver similar security properties to HIP BEX.  The HIP DEX protocol is primarily targeted at computation or memory- constrained sensor devices.  Like HIP BEX, it is expected to be used together with another suitable security protocol such as the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) [rfc5202-bis] for the protection of upper layer protocols.  HIP DEX can also be used as a keying mechanism for a MAC layer security protocol as is supported by IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE.802-15-4.2011].</t></abstract>
