<abstract><t>The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) [RFC8175] describes a protocol for modems to advertise the status of wireless links between reachable destinations to attached routers.  The core specification of the protocol assumes that every modem in the radio network has an attached DLEP router, and requires that the MAC address of the DLEP interface on the attached router be used to identify the destination in the network, for purposes of reporting the state and quality of the link to that destination.  This document describes a DLEP Extension allowing modems that do not meet the strict requirement above to use DLEP to describe link availability and quality to one or more destinations reachable beyond a device on the Layer 2 domain.</t></abstract>
