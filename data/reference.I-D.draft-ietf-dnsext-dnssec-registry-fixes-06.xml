<abstract><t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data.  There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms that is incomplete in that it lacks the implementation status of each algorithm.  This document provides an applicability statement on algorithm status for DNSSEC implementations.  This document replaces that registry table with a new IANA registry table for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers which lists each algorithm's status based on the current reference.  If that status is not defined in the original specification, this document assigns a status.</t></abstract>
