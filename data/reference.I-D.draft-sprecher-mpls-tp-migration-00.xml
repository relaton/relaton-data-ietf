<abstract><t>MPLS-TP defines a packet-based network architecture and a comprehensive set of tools that allow service providers to reliably deliver next generation services and applications, in a simple, scalable, and cost-effective way.  Such services are BW-hungry based and require strict guaranteed SLA.  Delivering next generation services over MPLS-TP based network in an economic way, enables service providers to increase their revenue while remaining competitive.  This document presents the motivations for migrating from different transport networks and services to MPLS-TP, and discusses the considerations and startegies for the migration.  The document also proposes specific activities and techniques needed to ensure smooth migration path from the different tranmsport networks and services to MPLS-TP</t></abstract>
