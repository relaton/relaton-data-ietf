<abstract><t>One of the major features or requirements of Cloud is on-demand CRUD (Create / Read / Update / Delete) of Cloud resources or associated resources.  The on-demand feature dictates that resources are CRUD in a time-frame in the order of seconds or few minutes since the arrival of the resource CRUD request.  Many network resources cannot be CRUD in that time-frame.  With the support of programmable networking (or SDN) in the model of I2RS will facilitate programming of network resources rapidly, thus facilitating CRUD of Cloud or related network resources on-demand.  Network resources associated with many network services can be either a Cloud resource or directly associated with a Cloud resource.  These resources should be CRUD on-demand in Cloud timescale.  In this draft, employing Hybrid (virtual) Cloud as a use case and using I2RS as the "model", we will define few requirements for programmable on-demand interfaces to network services or I2NS.</t></abstract>
