<abstract><t>This document revises the RFC 3775 rules on how Alternate Care-of Address option is processed.  Alternate Care-of Address option is used to carry the current care-of address inside a Mobility Header message.  This is used in addition to the source address in the packet in order to ensure that the care-of address is protected by IPsec ESP, the security mechanism that protects Mobility Header messages.  Unfortunately, RFC 3775 did not require verification that the source address and care-of address are the same.  This document adds that requirement.</t></abstract>
