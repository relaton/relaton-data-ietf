<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism for a user agent client to request the marking of a previously sent Instant Message as cancelled.  From a user's perspective, the user agent server, or other proxies or relay points in the network, can effectively remove the first message, giving the impression the first message was cancelled.  This document describes the utility of such a function, as well as the futility of attempting to create a true message cancellation feature.</t></abstract>
