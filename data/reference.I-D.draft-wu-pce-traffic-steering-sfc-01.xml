<abstract><t>This document provides an overview of the usage of Path Computation Element (PCE) with Service Function Chaining (SFC); which is described as the definition and instantiation of an ordered set of such service functions (such as firewalls, load balancers), and the subsequent "steering" of traffic flows through those service functions.  Further this document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and instantiate Service Function Paths (SFP).</t></abstract>
