<abstract><t>By introducing new Information Elements (IEs), this draft extends the existing BGP-related IEs to enable IPFIX [RFC7011] to export BGP community information, including BGP standard communities [RFC1997], BGP extended communities [RFC4360], and BGP large communities [RFC8092].  Network traffic information can then be accumulated and analyzed at the BGP community granularity, which represents the traffic of different kinds of customers, services, or geographical regions according to the network operator's BGP community planning. Network traffic information at the BGP community granularity is useful for network traffic analysis and engineering.  To clarify, no new BGP community attribute is defined in this document and this document does not replace BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defined in RFC7854.  The IEs introduced in this document are used by IPFIX, together with other IEs, to facilitate the IPFIX Collector analyzing network traffic at the BGP community granularity without needing to run the heavy BGP itself.  When needed, the IPFIX Mediator or Collector can use the IEs introduced in this document to report the BGP community-related traffic flow information it gets either from Exporters or through local correlation to other IPFIX devices.</t></abstract>
