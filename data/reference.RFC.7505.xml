<abstract><t>Internet mail determines the address of a receiving server through the DNS, first by looking for an MX record and then by looking for an A/AAAA record as a fallback.  Unfortunately, this means that the A/AAAA record is taken to be mail server address even when that address does not accept mail.  The No Service MX RR, informally called &quot;null MX&quot;, formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domain announces that it accepts no mail, without having to provide a mail server; this permits significant operational efficiencies.</t></abstract>
