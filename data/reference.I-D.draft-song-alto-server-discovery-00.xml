<abstract><t>A set of mechanisms are required to discover an Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Server.  These mechanisms enable applications to find a reliable information source which provides them with information regarding the underlying network.  By providing this information it would be possible to greatly increase application performance, reduce congestion and optimize the overall traffic across different networks.  This document specifies the use of general means such as DHCP, DNS or static configuration for ALTO server discovery.</t></abstract>
