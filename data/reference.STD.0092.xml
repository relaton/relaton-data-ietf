<abstract><t>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application-level protocol for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.  This document defines the rules for encoding IPP operations, attributes, and values into the Internet MIME media type called &quot;application/ipp&quot;.  It also defines the rules for transporting a message body whose Content-Type is &quot;application/ipp&quot; over HTTP and/or HTTPS.  The IPP data model and operation semantics are described in &quot;Internet                                      Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics&quot; (RFC 8011).</t></abstract>

<abstract><t>The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) is an application-level protocol for distributed printing using Internet tools and technologies.  This document describes a simplified model consisting of abstract objects, attributes, and operations that is independent of encoding and transport.  The model consists of several objects, including Printers and Jobs.  Jobs optionally support multiple Documents.</t><t>IPP semantics allow End Users and Operators to query Printer capabilities; submit Print Jobs; inquire about the status of Print Jobs and Printers; and cancel, hold, and release Print Jobs.  IPP semantics also allow Operators to pause and resume Jobs and Printers.</t><t>Security, internationalization, and directory issues are also addressed by the model and semantics.  The IPP message encoding and transport are described in &quot;Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Encoding                                   and Transport&quot; (RFC 8010).</t><t>This document obsoletes RFCs 2911, 3381, and 3382.</t></abstract>
