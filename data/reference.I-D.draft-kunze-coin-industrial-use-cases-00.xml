<abstract><t>Cyber-physical systems and the Industrial Internet of Things are characterized by diverse sets of requirements which can hardly be satisfied using standard networking technology.  One example are latency-critical computations which become increasingly complex and are consequently outsourced to more powerful cloud platforms for feasibility reasons.  The intrinsic physical propagation delay to these remote sites can, however, already be too high for given requirements.  The challenge is to develop techniques that bring together these requirements.  Utilizing available computational capabilities within the network can be a solution to this challenge which makes in-network computing concepts a promising starting point. This document discusses select industrial use cases to demonstrate how in-network computing concepts can be applied to the industrial domain and to point out essential requirements of industrial applications.</t></abstract>
