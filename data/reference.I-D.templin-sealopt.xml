<abstract><t>The Subnetwork Encapsulation and Adaptation Layer (SEAL) provides a mid-layer header designed for the encapsulation of an inner network layer packet within outer network layer headers.  SEAL also supports a transport mode of operation, where the inner payload corresponds to an ordinary transport layer payload.  However, SEAL can also provide benefit when used as an IPv6 destination option that contains a digital signature inserted by the source.  The source can thereafter use the signature to verify that any ICMPv6 messages received actually came from a router on the path, while destinations that share a secret key with the source can verify the signature to ensure data origin authentication.</t></abstract>
