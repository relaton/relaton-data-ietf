<abstract><t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated with 5G services.  These applications require better isolation and have more stringent performance requirements than that can be provided with traditional overlay VPNs.  An enhanced VPN may be used for 5G transport network slicing, and will also be of use in more generic scenarios.  This document specifies the IGP mechanisms with necessary extensions to build a set of Segment Routing (SR) based virtual networks with customized topology and resource attributes in the network.  These virtual networks could be used as the underlay of enhanced VPN service.  The proposed mechanism is applicable to both Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</t></abstract>
