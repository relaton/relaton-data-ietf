<abstract><t>This document introduces the Glass to Glass Internet Ecosystem (GGIE).  The GGIE goal is to improve how the Internet is used for all video, both amateur and professional, reflecting that the line between amature and professional video technology is increasinly blurred.  As the Glass to Glass (camera lens to viewing screen) name implies GGIE's scope is from the original recording by a lens, through the steps of editing, packaging, distributed and searching, and finally viewing.  GGIE is not a complete end to end architecture or solution, it is use cases and technical specifications that can serve as foundational building blocks for new Internet video innovation.  This is a companion effort to the GGIE W3C Taskforce in the W3C Web and TV Interest Group.  This document is being discussed on the ggie@ietg.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
