<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation in support of traffic engineering in networks controlled by Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS).</t><t>MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed from layered client/server networks.  It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers.  PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements.</t><t>Generic requirements for a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in RFC 4657, &quot;Path Computation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol Generic Requirements&quot;.  Generic requirements for a PCE discovery protocol are presented in RFC 4674, &quot;Requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery&quot;.</t><t>This document complements the generic requirements and presents detailed sets of PCC-PCE communication protocol requirements and PCE discovery protocol requirements for inter-layer traffic engineering. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
