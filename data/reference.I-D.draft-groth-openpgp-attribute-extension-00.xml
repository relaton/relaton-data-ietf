<abstract><t>A RFC was accepted extending TLS usage to include OpenPGP keys (RFC 5081) as an alternative or in addition to X.509 certificates, however the author did not really standardise the way the information in OpenPGP keys was to be presented and this could be detrimental or fragment efforts to utilise OpenPGP keys in this manner.  The author didn't touch on the issue generating confidence scores beyond potential use of Certificate Authorities.</t></abstract>
