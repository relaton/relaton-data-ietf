<abstract><t>This document provides a methodology and framework for quantifying the performance impact of the monitoring of IP flows on a network device and the export of this information to a Collector.  It identifies the rate at which the IP flows are created, expired, and successfully exported as a new performance metric in combination with traditional throughput.  The metric is only applicable to the devices compliant with RFC 5470, &quot;Architecture for IP Flow Information Export&quot;.  The methodology quantifies the impact of the IP flow monitoring process on the network equipment.  This document is not an Internet Standards  Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
