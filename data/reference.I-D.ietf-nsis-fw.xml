<abstract><t>The Next Steps in Signaling working group is considering protocols for signaling information about a data flow along its path in the network. The NSIS suite of protocols is envisioned to support various signaling applications that need to install and/or manipulate such state in the network. Based on on existing work on signaling requirements, this document proposes an architectural framework for these signaling protocols. This document provides a model for the network entities that take part in such signaling, and the relationship between signaling and the rest of network operation. We decompose the overall signaling protocol suite into a generic (lower) layer, with separate upper layers for each specific signaling application.</t></abstract>
