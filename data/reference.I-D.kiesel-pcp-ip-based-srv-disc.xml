<abstract><t>The Port Control Protocol (PCP) provides a mechanism to control how incoming packets are forwarded by upstream devices such as Network Address Translator IPv6/IPv4 (NAT64), Network Address Translator IPv4/IPv4 (NAT44), IPv6 and IPv4 firewall devices, and a mechanism to reduce application keep alive traffic.  This document establishes a well-known IP address for the PCP Server and documents how PCP clients embedded in endpoints can use it during the discovery and regular operation phases.</t></abstract>
