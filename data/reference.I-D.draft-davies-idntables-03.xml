<abstract><t>This memo describes a method of representing the domain name registration policy for a zone administrator using Extensible Markup Language (XML).  These policies, known as "Label Generation Rulesets" (LGRs), are particularly used for the implementation of Internationalised Domain Names (IDNs).  The rulesets are used to implement and share policy on which specific Unicode codepoints are permitted for registrations, which alternative codepoints are considered variants, and what actions may be performed on those variants.</t></abstract>
