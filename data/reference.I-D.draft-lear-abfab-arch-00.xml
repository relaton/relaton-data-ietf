<abstract><t>Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in the space of federated authentication and authorization.  Most of this effort has focused on two common use cases: network and web-based access, with few common building blocks within the architecture. This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions to the commonly used mechanisms for both federated and non-federated authentication and authorization, including Radius/Diameter, GSS/GS2, and SAML, to primarily address non-web based authentication, in a that will scale to large numbers of federations.</t></abstract>
