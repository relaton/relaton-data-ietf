<abstract><t>This document details an online coding method for network coding called CISEW: Coding Interval-based Sliding Encoding Window.  The method is proposed as a building block that could be integrated in a complete network coding protocol.  This building block is responsible of:  - decoding: maintaining and decoding of the set of received coded payloads,  - recoding: selecting the content of generated coded payloads,  - signaling: allowing for nodes to collect the information on the state of their neighbors.  CISEW is based on a sliding window method; it generates coded payloads using only a small subset of original payloads.  This allows for some real-time decoding (online decoding).  CISEW is a overhaul and redesign of a similar method called SEW, part of the previously proposed protocol DRAGONCAST.  CISEW refines the signaling and algorithms of SEW, and makes them more general.  CISEW offers a general framework for online network coding, with associated signaling.  From this framework, several online coding policies can be implemented.</t></abstract>
