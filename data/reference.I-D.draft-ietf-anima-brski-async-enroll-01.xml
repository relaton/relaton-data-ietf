<abstract><t>This document describes enhancements of bootstrapping a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI) to also operate in domains featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between involved components. Moreover, newly introduced are methods to perform the BRSKI approach in environments, in which the role of the pledge changes to a server instead of the client.  This changes the interaction model as the pledge is pushed to interact with the registrar instead of pulling information from the registrar.  To support both, BRSKI-AE relies on the exchange of it authenticated self-contained objects (signature- wrapped objects) also for requesting and distributing of domain specific device certificates.  The defined approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment protocol allowing the application of existing and potentially new certificate management protocols.</t></abstract>
