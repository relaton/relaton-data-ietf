<title>Securely Available Credentials Protocol</title>
<author initials='S.' surname='Farrell' fullname='S. Farrell' role='editor'><organization /></author>
<date year='2004' month='June' />
<abstract><t>This document describes a protocol whereby a user can acquire cryptographic credentials (e.g., private keys, PKCS #15 structures) from a credential server, using a workstation that has locally trusted software installed, but with no user-specific configuration.  The protocol's payloads are described in XML.  This memo also specifies a Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol (BEEP) profile of the protocol.  Security requirements are  met by mandating support for TLS and/or DIGEST-MD5 (through BEEP).  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
