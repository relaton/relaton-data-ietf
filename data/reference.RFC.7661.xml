<abstract><t>This document provides a mechanism to address issues that arise when TCP is used for traffic that exhibits periods where the sending rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion window.  It provides an experimental update to TCP that allows a TCP sender to restart quickly following a rate-limited interval.  This method is expected to benefit applications that send rate-limited traffic using TCP while also providing an appropriate response if congestion is experienced.</t><t>This document also evaluates the Experimental specification of TCP Congestion Window Validation (CWV) defined in RFC 2861 and concludes that RFC 2861 sought to address important issues but failed to deliver a widely used solution.  This document therefore reclassifies the status of RFC 2861 from Experimental to Historic.  This document obsoletes RFC 2861.</t></abstract>
