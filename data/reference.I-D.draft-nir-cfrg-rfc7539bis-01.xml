<abstract><t>This document defines the ChaCha20 stream cipher as well as the use of the Poly1305 authenticator, both as stand-alone algorithms and as a "combined mode", or Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm.  RFC 7539, the predecessor of this document, was meant to serve as a stable reference and an implementation guide.  It was a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG).  This document merges the errata filed against RFC 7539 and adds a little text to the Security Considerations section.</t></abstract>
