<abstract><t>The Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol is implemented by devices called TRILL Switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges).  TRILL supports both point-to-point and multi-access links and is designed so that a variety of link protocols can be used between TRILL switch ports.  This document standardizes methods for encapsulating TRILL in IP (v4 or v6) so as to use IP as a TRILL link protocol in a unified TRILL campus.</t></abstract>
