<abstract><t>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are frequently used for large-scale content delivery.  As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs.  There is a requirement for interconnecting standalone CDNs so that their collective CDN footprint can be leveraged for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to end users.  However, no standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitate such CDN interconnection.  The "CDN Interconnect Problem Statement" Internet-Draft outlines the problem area for the IETF with a view towards creating a working group.  This working group would work on an interoperable and scalable solution for CDN interconnection.  The goal of the present document is to start outlining the requirements for such a "CDN Interconnection" solution.</t></abstract>
