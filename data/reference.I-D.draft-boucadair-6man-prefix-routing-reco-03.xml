<abstract><t>The length of IP prefixes is an information used by forwarding and routing processes is policy-based.  As such, no maximum length must be assumed by design.  Discussions on the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing revealed a need for a clear recommendation on which bits must be used by forwarding decision-making processes.  This document sketches a recommendation to be followed by forwarding and routing designs with regards to the prefix length.  The aim is to avoid hard-coded routing and forwarding designs that exclude some IP prefix lengths.</t></abstract>
