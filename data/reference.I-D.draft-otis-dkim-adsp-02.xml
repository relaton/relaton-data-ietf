<abstract><t>Author Domain Signing Practices (ADSP) advertises the adoption level of DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), as described in [RFC4871], for outbound messages publicly exchanged using SMTP, as described in [RFC2821].  Application of ADSP by Mail User Agents (MUAs) might need to be offered as an option, to accommodate messages exchanged over different public protocols.  This document describes records that authors' domains can publish to advertise their DKIM practices for outgoing messages containing the Author Domain.  ADSP will not dictate any specific use of DKIM identity parameters.  Such identity restrictions go beyond the charter and unnecessarily limit ADSP applicability.  Confirmation of an individual author's identity is orthogonal to and fully independent of ADSP.</t></abstract>
