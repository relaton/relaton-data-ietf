<abstract><t>When an IP address is shared among several subscribers -- with a NAT or with an application-level proxy -- it is impossible for the server to differentiate between different clients.  Such differentiation is valuable in several scenarios.  This memo describes a technique to differentiate TCP and UDP clients sharing an IP address.  The proposed method uses an ICMP Echo Request packet, which allows for more information about the user mapping to be transmitted than in the case of using the TCP option - and allows the use with UDP and other protocols.</t></abstract>
