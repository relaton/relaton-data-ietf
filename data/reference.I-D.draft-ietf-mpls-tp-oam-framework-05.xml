<abstract><t>Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) procedures as specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE), pseudowire (PW) and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented with additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching management for packet transport applications that do not rely on the presence of a control plane.  This document describes a framework to support a comprehensive set of OAM procedures that fulfills the MPLS-TP OAM requirements [12].  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t></abstract>
