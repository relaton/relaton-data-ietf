<abstract><t>This document describes the Universal Voting Markup Language (UVML), a syntax for the structured representation of opinion in free text. Using UVML, opinions can be encoded in text, image, or video, and reliably interpreted by either human readers or automated-agents. UVML supports both rating and ranking semantics.  Ratings may be scored using symbols associated with the five most commonly used opinion dimensions: quality(*), importance(!), outlook($), support- opposition(+), and likelihood(%).  In addition, UVML defines a syntax for optionally including a demographic signature by which voters can publish basic demographic information with their UVML votes.  The design of UVML leverages cross-cultural sentiment and voting-systems scholarship.</t></abstract>
