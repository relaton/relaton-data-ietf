<abstract><t>One of the treaties administered by the International Telecommunications Union is the International Telecommunications Regulations (ITRs), whose purpose is to promote the development of telecommunication services.  The 1988 version of the ITRs opened the way for privatisation, liberalization, and the growth of the Internet and mobile networks.  Given the subsequent significant structure and technological changes, the ITU membership agreed to meet in 2012 to revise the ITRs.  While consensus was found on an overwhelming majority of the treaty text, some provisions proved to be controversial, leading to a split in the membership and sharp criticism of selected provisions.  As a result, some ITU Member States did not sign the treaty.  This document analyses that criticism and attempts to place it in context; it identifies problems that may arise if states to not accede to the treaty, and suggests a way forward, concluding that not acceding may have undesirable results for the citizens of non-signatory countries and for interoperability in general.</t></abstract>
