Mobility is beneficial when the user moves, either inside or outside the enterprise network, and acquires a new IP address.  This document describes a solution using Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4) and mobility extensions to IKEv2 (MOBIKE) to provide secure connectivity and mobility.  This document specifies an  Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and  requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t></abstract>
