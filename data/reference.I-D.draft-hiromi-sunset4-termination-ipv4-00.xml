<abstract><t>After sun-setting of IPv4, many devices are connected to IPv6 single stack network. In this document we describe a workaround of IPv6 enabled network configuration. At this moment, the condition of IPv6 adoption on the consumer devices such as PC, tablet, mobile terminal and entertainment devices are various. For example, some devices are fully support IPv6 client but some are not. It is very hard to provide IPv6 network service with these various conditioned devices. To solve this problem, we tried to verify some configurations to connect these devices into IPv6 enabled consumer network for termination of IPv4 network services.</t></abstract>
