<abstract><t>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network diagnostics by providers and users, as well for as public policy.  To conduct such measurements, user networks gather data, either on their own initiative or instructed by a measurement controller, and then upload the measurement results to a designated measurement server.  Understanding the various scenarios and users of measuring broadband performance is essential to development of the system requirements.  The details of the measurement metrics themselves are beyond the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
