<abstract><t>This draft proposed a generic routing method and protocol for a regular data center network, named as the fault-avoidance routing (FAR) protocol.  FAR protocol provides a generic routing method for all kinds of network architectures that are proposed for large-scale cloud data centers over the past few years.  FAR protocol is well designed to fully leverage the regularity in the topology and compute its routing table in a simple way.  Fat-tree is taken as an example architecture to illuminate how to apply FAR protocol in this draft.</t></abstract>
