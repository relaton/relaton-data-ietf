<abstract><t>The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is used along with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) to provide a control channel between media senders and receivers.  This allows constructing a feedback loop to enable application adaptation and monitoring, among other uses.  The basic reporting mechanisms offered by RTCP are generic, yet quite powerful and suffice to cover a range of uses.  This document provides guidelines on extending RTCP if those basic mechanisms prove insufficient.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
