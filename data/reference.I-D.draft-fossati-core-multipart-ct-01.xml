<abstract><t>This memo defines a new content format encoding that can be used to combine several different media types into a single CoAP message- body.  The proposed encoding provides a cheap framing facility aimed at minimizing the overhead bits as much as possible.  Its main use case is for applications whose purpose is as simple as just pulling together a number of known content formats, with the caveat that their juxtaposition must not raise any semantic ambiguity on the receiving side (i.e. strictly ordered, with no optional parts).</t></abstract>
