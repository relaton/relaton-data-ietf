<abstract><t>We propose here a service that enables nodes located behind one or more IPv4 NATs to obtain IPv6 connectivity by tunneling packets over UDP; we call this the Teredo service. Running the service requires the help of 'Teredo servers' and 'Teredo relays'; the Teredo servers are stateless, and only have to manage a small fraction of the traffic between Teredo clients; the Teredo relays act as IPv6 routers between the Teredo service and the 'native' IPv6 Internet; the relays can also provide interoperability with hosts using other transition mechanisms such as '6to4'.</t></abstract>
