<abstract><t>Ability to convey a trait information of caller, such as calling party category which includes things like Law Enforcement, Technical Support, Anonymous Caller from Payphone etc. and type of location where the call initiated which includes things like Police Station, Hotel/Motel, Fire Station, Jail etc. might be useful for receiving entity of the call to make an authorization decision on its treatment of incoming call. This draft proposes an approach for conveying trait information for caller's category and call initiating point in SIP using the Security Assertion Markup Language(SAML). It relies on a third party to act as an asserting party to provide information described above. This draft is in a fairly early state and has many details that are missing. This version tries to describe and illustrate what the SAML based solution would look like to aid in evaluating SAML as solution to carry calling party's category and call initiating location information.</t></abstract>
