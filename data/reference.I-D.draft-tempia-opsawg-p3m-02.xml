<abstract><t>This document describes a method to achieve performance measurements of live traffic, applicable to any packet based traffic stream, including L2, L3, MPLS traffic, unicast and multicast.  The method can be easily implemented using tools and features already available on existing routing platforms without any protocol extension and, for this reason, it does not raise any interoperability issue.  However, the method could be further improved by means of some extension to existing protocols, but this aspect is left for further study and it is out of the scope of the document.</t></abstract>
