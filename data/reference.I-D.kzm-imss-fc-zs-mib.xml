<abstract><t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes managed objects for information related to a Fibre Channel Zone Server. At present, this memo is being proposed to T11.5 (http://www.t11.org). The plan is that it will later become a work item of IETF's IMSS working group.</t></abstract>
