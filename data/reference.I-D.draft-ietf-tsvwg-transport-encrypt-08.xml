<abstract><t>This document describes some implications of applying end-to-end encryption at the transport layer.  It first identifies in-network uses of transport layer header information.  Then, it reviews some implications of developing end-to-end transport protocols that use encryption to provide confidentiality of the transport protocol headers, or that use authentication to protect the integrity of transport header information.  Since measurement and analysis of the impact of network characteristics on transport protocols has been important to the design of current transports, it also considers the impact of transport encryption on transport and application evolution.</t></abstract>
