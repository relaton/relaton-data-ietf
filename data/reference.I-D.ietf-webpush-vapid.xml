<abstract><t>An application server can use the method described to voluntarily identify itself to a push service.  The "vapid" authentication scheme allows a client to include its an identity in a signed token with requests that it makes.  The signature can be used by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server to a single entity.  The identification information can allow the operator of a push service to contact the operator of the application server.  The signature can be used to restrict the use of a push subscription to a single application server.</t></abstract>
