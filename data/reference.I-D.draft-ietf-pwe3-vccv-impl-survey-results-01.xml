<abstract><t>Most pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential to the emulation, to inhibit ECMP behavior, and to discriminate OAM from PW packets.  However, some encapsulations treat the Control Word as optional.  As a result, implementations of the CW, for encapsulations for which it is optional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model and service provider network.  Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity Verification (CV) Types.  This flexibility has led to reports of interoperability issues within deployed networks and associated drafts to attempt to remedy the situation.  This survey of the PW/VCCV user community was conducted to determine implementation trends.  The survey and results is presented herein.</t></abstract>
