<abstract><t>The GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) work is extending GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of Ethernet LSPs.  IEEE Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) specifies an adjunct OAM flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks.  CFM can be also used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and triggering recovery mechanisms.  The ITU-T Y.1731 specification builds on CFM and specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including Performance Monitoring, for Ethernet networks.  This memo specifies extensions of GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the setup of the associated Ethernet OAM (CFM and Y.1731) entities for point-to-point Ethernet LSPs.Changes from previous version Two alternative ways to extend RSVP-TE with OAM configuration are summarised in a new appendix ("Discussion on alternatives").  The description of RSVP-TE extensions is restructured; a new section is added ("Technology Independent Extensions") to identify common technology independent extensions.  Note, this part may be moved to a separate framework document leaving only the Ethernet specific extensions in this document.  Some nits and typos cleared.</t></abstract>
