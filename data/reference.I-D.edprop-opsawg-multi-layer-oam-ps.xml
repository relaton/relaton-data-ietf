<abstract><t>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms are critical building blocks in network operations.  They used for service fulfillment assurance, and for service diagnosis, troubleshooting, and repair.  The current practice is that many technologies rely on their own OAM protocols and procedures that are exclusive to a given layer.  At present, there is little consolidation of OAM in the management plane or well-documented inter-layer OAM operation.  Vendors and operators dedicate significant resources and effort through the whole OAM life-cycle each time a new technology is introduced.  This is exacerbated when dealing with integration of OAM into overlay networks, which require better OAM visibility since there is no method to exchange OAM information between overlay and underlay.  This document analyzes the problem space for multi-layer OAM in the management plane with a focus on layer and technology independent OAM management considerations.  It concludes that an attempt to define an architecture for consolidated management should be undertaken, and if this attempt satisfies key objectives, a gap analysis and a program of standardization should follow.</t></abstract>
