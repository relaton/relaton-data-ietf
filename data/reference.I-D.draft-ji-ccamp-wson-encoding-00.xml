<abstract><t>Reconfigurable add/drop optical multiplexers(ROADM) featured highly asymmetric switching capability, is an essential element in current wavelength switched optical network(WSON).Because the multiple degree Reconfigurable add/drop optical multiplexer(ROADM) can not only add/ drop wavelength but also switch wavelength, it is necessary to know the switch connectivity offered by such a network element. With the development of ROADM, the constraint of wavelength and direction is abated, so the encoding of the ROADM needs improvement. This memo provides a novel encoding for different ROADMs, Which is applicable to the encoding of different kind of ROADMs.</t></abstract>
