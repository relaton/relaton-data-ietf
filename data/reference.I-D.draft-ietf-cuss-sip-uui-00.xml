<abstract><t>There is a need for applications using SIP to exchange User to User Information (UUI) data during session establishment.  This information, known as call control UUI, is a small piece of data inserted by an application initiating the session, and utilized by an application accepting the session.  This data is opaque to SIP and its function is unrelated to any basic SIP function.  This document defines a new SIP header field, User-to-User, to transport UUI, along with an extension mechanism.</t></abstract>
