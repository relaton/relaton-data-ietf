<abstract><t>This document describes a Fully-Specified FEC scheme, corresponding to FEC Encoding ID 6 (to be confirmed (tbc)), for the RaptorQ forward error correction code and its application to reliable delivery of data objects.  RaptorQ codes are a new family of codes that provide superior flexibility, support for larger source block sizes and better coding efficiency than Raptor codes in RFC5053.  RaptorQ is also a fountain code, i.e., as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated by the encoder on-the-fly from the source symbols of a source block of data.  The decoder is able to recover the source block from any set of encoding symbols for most cases equal to the number of source symbols and in rare cases with slightly more than the number of source symbols.  The RaptorQ code described here is a systematic code, meaning that all the source symbols are among the encoding symbols that can be generated.</t></abstract>
