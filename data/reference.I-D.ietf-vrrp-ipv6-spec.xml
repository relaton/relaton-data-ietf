<abstract><t>This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for IPv6. It is version three (3) of the protocol. It is based on the original version of VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC2338. VRRP specifies an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN. The VRRP router controlling the IP address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Master, and forwards packets sent to these IP addresses. The election process provides dynamic fail over in the forwarding responsibility should the Master become unavailable. The advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switch over to back up routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [ND] mechanisms.</t></abstract>
