<abstract><t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows an organization to take responsibility for a message, in a way that can be validated by a recipient. The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agent's. DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public-key cryptography and key server technology. This permits verifying the signer of a message, as well as the integrity of its contents. The ultimate goal of this framework is to permit a signing domain to assert responsibility for a message, thus proving and protecting the identity associated with the message and the integrity of the messages itself, while retaining the functionality of Internet email as it is known today. Such protection of email identity can assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing". This document provides an overview of the DKIM service and describes how it can fit into a messaging service. It also describes how DKIM relates to other IETF message signature technologies.</t></abstract>
