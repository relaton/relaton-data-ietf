<abstract><t>Threshold secret sharing (TSS) provides a way to generate N shares from a value, so that any M of those shares can be used to reconstruct the original value, but any M-1 shares provide no information about that value.  This method can provide shared access control on key material and other secrets that must be strongly protected.  This note defines a threshold secret sharing method based on polynomial interpolation in GF(256) and a format for the storage and transmission of shares.  It also provides usage guidance, describes how to test an implementation, and supplies test cases.</t></abstract>
