<abstract><t>BGP is utilised as a key intra- and inter-autonomous system routing protocol in modern IP networks.  The failure modes, as defined by the original protocol standards, are based on a number of assumptions around the impact of session failure.  Numerous incidents both in the global Internet routing table and within service provider networks have been caused by strict handling of a single invalid UPDATE message causing large-scale failures in one or more autonomous systems.  This memo describes the current use of BGP within service provider networks, and outlines a set of requirements for further work to enhance the mechanisms available to a BGP implementation when erroneous data is detected.  Whilst this document does not provide specification of any standard, it is intended as an overview of a set of enhancements to BGP to improve the protocol's robustness to suit its current deployment.</t></abstract>
