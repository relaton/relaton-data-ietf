<abstract><t>As IPv6 network grows, there will be more engineers and also non- engineers who will have the need to use an IPv6 address in text. While the IPv6 address architecture [RFC4291] section 2.2 depicts a flexible model for text representation of an IPv6 address, this flexibility has been causing problems for operators ,system engineers, and customers.  The following draft will describe the problems that a flexible text representation has been causing.  This document also recommends a text representation method that best avoids confusion.</t></abstract>
