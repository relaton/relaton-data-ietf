<abstract><t>With the increase number of protocols and applications that rely on digital certificates to authenticate either the communication channel (TLS) or the data itself (PKIX), the need for providing an efficient revocation system is paramount.  Although the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) allows for efficient lookup of the revocation status of a certificate, the distribution of this information via HTTP (or very rarely) HTTPS is not particularly efficient for high volume websites without incurring in high distribution costs (e.g., CDN).  In particular, this specification defines a new set of messages (i.e., OCSPv2 Request and OCSPv2 Response) that address the inefficiencies of OCSPv1 by (a) providing range-based responses to optimize (reduce) the number of pre-computed responses required by a CA, and (b) allowing the inclusion of other (certificate chain) responses in the same response for round-trip and caching optimization.  The deployment of OCSPv2 to validate the status of a certificate is meant to lower the costs of providing revocation services and increase the efficiency of the service, thus allowing for short-lived responses (i.e., hours instead of days).</t></abstract>
