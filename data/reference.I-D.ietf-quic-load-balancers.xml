<abstract><t>The QUIC protocol design is resistant to transparent packet inspection, injection, and modification by intermediaries.  However, the server can explicitly cooperate with network services by agreeing to certain conventions and/or sharing state with those services. This specification provides a standardized means of solving three problems: (1) maintaining routability to servers via a low-state load balancer even when the connection IDs in use change; (2) explicit encoding of the connection ID length in all packets to assist hardware accelerators; and (3) injection of QUIC Retry packets by an anti-Denial-of-Service agent on behalf of the server.</t></abstract>
