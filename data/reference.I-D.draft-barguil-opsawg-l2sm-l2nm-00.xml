<abstract><t>This document defines a Yang Data model, L2NM, that can be used to manage the provisioning of Layer 2 VPN services in a Service Provider Network.  The Yang module defined in this document provides representation of the Layer 2 VPN Service and is aimed at being used by a Network Controller, which can derive from it the configuration information that will be sent to the network devices, as well the the underlay transport network in a service provider environment.  RFC 8466 defines a Layer 2 VPN service model (L2SM) that can be used in the communication between a Customer and the Network Operator.This document complements L2SM by creating a network-centric view of the service to be used in the communication between the entity that interacts directly with the customer, the service orchestrator, (either fully automated or a human operator) and the entity in charge of network orchestration and control (a.k.a., network controller/ orchestrator).  The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in RFC 8342.</t></abstract>
