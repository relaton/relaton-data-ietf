<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced a set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation Element as a tool to help MPLS-TE and GMPLS LSP tunnels placement. In the PCE architecture, a main assumption has been done concerning the information that the PCE needs to perform its computation: the Traffic Engineering Database (TED) contains all pertinent and suitable information regarding the network that is in the scope of a PCE.  Nevertheless, the TED requirements as well as the TED information have not yet been formalized.  In addition, some recent RFC (like the Backward Recursive Path Computation procedure) or WG draft (like draft-ietf-pce-hierarchy ...) suffer from a lack of information in the TED, leading to a non optimal result or to some difficulties to deploy them.  This memo tries to identity some TED requirements for the PCE.  It is split in two main section: the identification of the specific information to be stored in the TED and how it may be populated.</t></abstract>
