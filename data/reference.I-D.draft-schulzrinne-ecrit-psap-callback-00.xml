<abstract><t>After an emerency call is completed it is possible that the need for further communication between the call-taker and the emergency caller arises.  For example, further assistance may be needed but the communication previously got interrupted.  A call-taker may trigger a callback towards the emergency caller using the contact information provided with the initial emergency call.  This callback would then be treated like any other call.  As a consequence, it may get blocked by authorization policies configured by the person seeking help or may get forwarded to his answering machine.  The current ECRIT framework document addresses callbacks in a limited fashion and thereby covers a few scenarios.  This document discusses shortcomings and raises the question whether additional solution techniques are needed.</t></abstract>
