<abstract><t>This document discusses common practices used in deploying routing protocols in both public and private networks.  The focus is not to describe how routing protocols should be deployed, but rather how they are generally deployed, to provide those working on specifications which impact the operation of routing protocols with guidance in what will likely be deployed, or what will likely not be deployed.  The focus in thie document will be ionterdomain routing,but it will cover aspects of intradomain routing, as well.</t></abstract>
