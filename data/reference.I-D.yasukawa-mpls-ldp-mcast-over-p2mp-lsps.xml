<abstract><t>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) includes the facility to provision point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) which can be used to construct P2MP tunnels across MPLS networks. The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) has also been extended to support label distribution for multicast traffic by forming multicast LSPs. When traffic for a user network is carried across a provider network, it is common practice for the traffic to be placed in tunnels. This document examines the requirements to carry multicast LDP traffic across a provider network within P2MP MPLS tunnels, and introduces solution models that meet those requirements. Note that the requirements and solutions discussed in this document are also applicable to the use of multicast LDP on multi-access networks.</t></abstract>
