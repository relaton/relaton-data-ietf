<abstract><t>Certain application protocols are highly transactional and require substantial care when dealing with latency.  Queries for versioning information are, in these circumstances, costly.  In addition, there is a desire to allow for a means to specify a lightweight means to alternative transport protocols, such as making use of SCTP instead of TCP.  This memo specifies a new DNS RR with an eye toward the least necessary roundtrips to determine various protocols, port numbers, and options for a given service instance.</t></abstract>
