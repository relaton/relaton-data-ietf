<abstract><t>In many environments, firewall, NAT and IP addressing issues make remote management of devices containing SIP user agents difficult. This document defines a SIP event package for notifying a device that it should connect to a management entity for management operations. This type of "call-home" management avoids the need to maintain persistent TCP connections to, or generate additional STUN traffic with, the management entity.</t></abstract>
