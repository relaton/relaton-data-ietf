<abstract><t>The IPv6-based end-user device is commonly not able to utilize the advantages introduced by the mobile IP protocols. However, this specification describes how an end-user device supporting only IPv6 protocol stack may be provided with a mobility service by the mobile IPv4-based access network. The unaltered end-user device relies on the functionalities of the two network-side entities, the Home Agent and the new Proxy Mobile Node, acting on its behalf and providing the IP layer mobility management.</t></abstract>
