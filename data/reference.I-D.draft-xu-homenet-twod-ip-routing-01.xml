<abstract><t>Home network design faces many challenges currently.  Two of them are multi-homing and policy enforcement.  Different with other types of networks, home network operators are usually not professional technicians or geeks.  The problems we face are fundamentally related with the poor semantics provided by current destination-based routing protocol.  TwoD-IP routing protocol is a link state routing protocol that makes routing decisions based on both destination and source addresses. This document describes the mechanism for supporting flexible multi- homing and policy routing across home networks.</t></abstract>
