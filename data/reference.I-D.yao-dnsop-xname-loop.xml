<abstract><t>The Domain Name System (DNS) has provided some means, such as CNAME or DNAME, where a query can be redirected to a different name.  The zone operator should be careful about this redirection, which may forms a loop.  The detail analysis of xNAME loop detection and its impacts are not specified in the RFC 1035 and RFC 2672.  This document gives a detail analysis of xNAME loop and its impacts.  It also gives some advices for using xNAME.</t></abstract>
