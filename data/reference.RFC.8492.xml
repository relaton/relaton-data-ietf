<abstract><t>This memo defines several new ciphersuites for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support certificateless, secure authentication using only a simple, low-entropy password.  The exchange is called &quot;TLS-PWD&quot;.  The ciphersuites are all based on an authentication and key exchange protocol, named &quot;dragonfly&quot;, that is resistant to offline dictionary attacks.</t></abstract>
