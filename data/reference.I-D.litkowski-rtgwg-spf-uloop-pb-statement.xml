<abstract><t>A micro-loop is a packet forwarding loop that may occur transiently among two or more routers in a hop-by-hop packet forwarding paradigm.  In this document, we are trying to analyze the impact of using different Link State IGP implementations in a single network in regards of microloops.  The analysis is focused on the SPF triggers and SPF delay algorithm.</t></abstract>
