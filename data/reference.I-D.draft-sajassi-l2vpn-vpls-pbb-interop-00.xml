<abstract><t>The scalability of H-VPLS (either with MPLS or Ethernet access network) can be improved by incorporating Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB - - 802.1ah) functionality in PE devices. PBB is being worked on in IEEE as an amendment to 802.1Q to improve the scalability of MAC addresses and service instances in Provider Ethernet networks. This draft describes how IEEE 802.1ah functionality can be used in the H-VPLS access network to attain better scalability in terms of number of customer MAC addresses and number of service instances that can be supported. This draft also describes the scenarios and the mechanisms for incorporating PBB functionality within H-VPLS (with either MPLS or Ethernet access network) and interoperability between them.</t></abstract>
