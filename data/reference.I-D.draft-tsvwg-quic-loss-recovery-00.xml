<abstract><t>QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) is a new multiplexed and secure transport atop UDP, designed from the ground up and optimized for HTTP/2 semantics.  While built with HTTP/2 as the primary application protocol, QUIC builds on decades of transport and security experience, and implements mechanisms that make it attractive as a modern general-purpose transport.  QUIC implements the spirit of known TCP loss recovery mechanisms, described in RFCs, various Internet-drafts, and also those prevalent in the Linux TCP implementation.  This document describes QUIC loss recovery, and where applicable, attributes the TCP equivalent in RFCs, Internet- drafts, academic papers, and/or TCP implementations.</t></abstract>
