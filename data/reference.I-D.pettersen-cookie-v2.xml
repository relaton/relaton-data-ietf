<abstract><t>This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and responses.  It describes three HTTP headers, Cookie, Cookie2, and Set-Cookie2, which carry state information between participating origin servers and user agents.  The method described here differs from both Netscape's Cookie proposal [Netscape], and [RFC2965], but it can, provided some requirements are met, interoperate with HTTP/1.1 user agents that use Netscape's method.  (See the HISTORICAL section.)  This document defines new rules for how cookies can be shared between servers within a domain.  These new rules are intended to address security and privacy concerns that are difficult to counter for clients implementing Netscape's proposed rules or the rules specified by RFC 2965.  This document reflects implementation experience with RFC 2965 and obsoletes it.</t></abstract>
