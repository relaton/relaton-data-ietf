<abstract><t>For more than 30 years, a large number of implementations of the TCP/ IP protocol suite have been subject to a variety of attacks, with effects ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) or data injection, to information leakage that could be exploited for pervasive monitoring. The root of these issues has been, in many cases, the poor selection of transient numeric identifiers in such protocols, usually as a result of insufficient or misleading specifications.  This document formally updates RFC3552, such that RFCs are required to include a security and privacy analysis of the transient numeric identifiers they specify.</t></abstract>
