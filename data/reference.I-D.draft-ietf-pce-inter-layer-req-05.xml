<abstract><t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of path computation in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. MPLS and GMPLS networks may be constructed from layered client/servicr networks. It is advantageous for overall network efficiency to provide end-to-end traffic engineering across multiple network layers. PCE is a candidate solution for such requirements. Generic requirements for a communication protocol between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in "PCE Communication Protocol Generic Requirements". Generic requirements for PCE discovery protocol are presented in "Requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE) Discovery".</t></abstract>
