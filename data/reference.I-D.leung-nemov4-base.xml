<abstract><t>This document describes the support of Mobile Networks, as defined in Mobile IPv4, by the Mobile Router and Home Agent. A Mobile Router is responsible for the mobility of one or more network segments or subnets moving together. The Mobile Router hides its mobility from the nodes on the mobile network. The nodes on the Mobile Network may be fixed in relationship to the Mobile Router and may not have any mobility function. Extensions to Mobile IPv4 are introduced to support Mobile Networks.</t></abstract>
