<abstract><t>Within the Domain Name System, several names have been reserved or used for special purposes, some at the top level and some at other levels.  RFC 2606 identified An IANA registry of Reserved and Special Names is established to reduce the likelihood of conflict of names and the consequent ambiguity.
