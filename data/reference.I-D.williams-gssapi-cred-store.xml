<abstract><t>The details of Generic Security Service (GSS) credential store management vary by platform and even by GSS mechanism. Credential store management is an interesting concept that requires exploration. This document defines a small extension to the GSS-API for GSS-API credential store management. While exploration of the credential store management problem is the goal of this document, implementation of these interfaces is not discounted nor discouraged.</t></abstract>
