<abstract><t>Due to the dramatically increased network traffic and the desire of differentiated services, it is essential for operators to provide the traffic steering service under limited network resources and maximize their benefits at the same time.  The traditional method for traffic steering depends on static configuration which is time consuming and error-prone.  As development of SDN, the controller is introduced for traffic steering with the global view of network topology and route information.  This document describes typical use cases for traffic steering services and proposes the traffic steering solution based on BGP controller.</t></abstract>
