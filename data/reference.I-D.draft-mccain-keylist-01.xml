<abstract><t>This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client may subscribe to an organization's keylist to keep its internal keystore up-to-date.  Ensuring that all members of an organization have their colleagues' most recent PGP public keys is critical to maintaining operational security.  Without the most recent keys and a source of trust for those keys (as this document specifies), users must manually update and sign each others keys -- a system that is untenable in larger organizations.  This document proposes a experimental format for the keylist file as well as requirements for clients who wish to implement this experimental keylist subscription functionality.</t></abstract>
