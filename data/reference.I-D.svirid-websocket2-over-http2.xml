<abstract><t>This document specifies a new protocol called WebSocket2 ontop of HTTP/2.  The WebSocket2 protocol enables two-way binary communication between a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code.  This protocol has little incommon with the WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] other than client side API compatibility.  Please send feedback to the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
