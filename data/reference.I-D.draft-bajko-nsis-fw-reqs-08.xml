<abstract><t>3GPP2 is working in specifying a way to allow the mobile network subscribers to configure the Firewalls in their network according to their needs[3]. This document defines requirements for a Firewall Configuration Protocol. It has been produced by a number of 3GPP2 member companies and endorsed by 3GPP2. It contains 3GPP2 requirements to a next generation Firewall Configuration Protocol.  With the number of threats that keep increasing on the Internet, many networks have decided to deploy Firewalls to reduce the possible risks and protect their users as well as their network resources. Firewalls can however present many issues with new protocols, applications and scenarios to be supported. Data packets may be discarded at the Firewalls. In addition, the clients may often be the only parties that know the requirements and details of the data communications. This document therefore explains why a protocol allowing clients to configure Firewalls would be useful, and attempts to identify the requirements and features to be supported by such a protocol.</t></abstract>
