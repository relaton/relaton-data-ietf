<abstract><t>This document presents edge-assisted marked flow termination (EMFT) for PCN.  It assumes packet-size independent excess marking, i.e. packets exceeding the supportable rate (SR) of a link are marked as "excess-traffic" (ET).  EMFT terminates only flows with at least one ET-marked packet.  The problem is to avoid that all flows with ET- marked packets are terminated.  This draft proposes two solutions. Flow-based EMFT (F-EMFT) considers single flows separately and terminates them when sufficiently many packets of them have been received by the PCN egress node with an ET-mark.  Aggregate-based EMFT (A-EMFT) considers ingress-egress-aggregates and terminates flows thereof sufficiently many ET-marked packets have been received for that aggregate.</t></abstract>
