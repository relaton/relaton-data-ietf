<abstract><t>This document recommends that IETF formally require its standards work to be IP version agnostic or to explicitly include support for IPv6, with some exceptions.  It further recommends that IETF revisit and update the previous attempts to review existing standards for IPv6 compliance.  It makes this recommendation in order to ensure that it is possible to operate without dependencies on IPv4.</t></abstract>
