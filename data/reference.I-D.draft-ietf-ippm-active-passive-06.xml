<abstract><t>This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive performance assessment.  The construction of Metrics and Methods can be described as Active or Passive.  Some methods may use a subset of both active and passive attributes, and we refer to these as Hybrid Methods.  This memo also describes multiple dimensions to help evaluate new methods as they emerge.</t></abstract>
