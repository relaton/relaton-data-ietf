<abstract><t>There have been many implementations and deployments of legacy syslog over TCP for many years.  That protocol has evolved without being standardized and has proven to be quite interoperable in practice.  The aim of this specification is to document three things: how to transmit standardized syslog over TCP, how TCP has been used as a transport for legacy syslog, and how to correlate these usages.</t></abstract>
