<abstract><t>This document describes an architecture based on the Host Identity Protocol (HIP), for active tags, i.e. RFIDs (Radio Frequency Identifiers) that include tamper resistant computing resources, as specified for example in the ISO 14443 or 15693 standards. HIP-Tags never expose their identity in clear text, but hide this value (typically an EPC-Code) by a particular equation (f) that can be only solved by a dedicated entity, referred as the portal. HIP exchanges occurred between HIP-Tags and portals; they are shuttled by IP packets, through the Internet cloud.</t></abstract>
