<abstract><t>In current Cloud and Data Center (DC) environment, the manageable virtualized resources aggregated by the Resource Management Platform (RMP) may be supplied by different types of hypervisor implementations.  The RMP needs to support a variety of hypervisor APIs to allow access, management and integration of different types of resources.  In order to decouple the RMP from any particular hypervisor implementation, a unified API needs to be developed.  This draft presents the requirements and preliminary implementation considerations for such an API.</t></abstract>
