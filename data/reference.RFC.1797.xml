<abstract><t>There appears to be some interest in experimenting with subnetting the class A addresses. It is suggested that conducting an experiment now to identify and fix any software that does not properly handle subnetted class A addresses would be useful and important. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.  This does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</t></abstract>
