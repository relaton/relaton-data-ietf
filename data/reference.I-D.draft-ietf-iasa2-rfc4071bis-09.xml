<abstract><t>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established in 2005.  In the years since then, the needs of the IETF evolved in ways that required changes to its administrative structure.  The purpose of this document is to document and describe the IASA 2.0 structure.  Under IASA 2.0, the work of the IETF's administrative and fundraising tasks is conducted by an administrative organization, the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company ("IETF LLC").  Under this structure, the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) was eliminated, and its oversight and advising functions transferred to the IETF LLC Board.  The IETF LLC provides the corporate legal home for the IETF, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and financial support for the operation of the RFC Editor.  This document describes the structure of the IETF Administrative Support Activity, version 2 (IASA 2.0).  It defines the roles and responsibilities of the IETF LLC Board, the IETF Executive Director, and ISOC in the fiscal and administrative support of the IETF standards process.  It also defines the membership and selection rules for the IETF LLC Board.  This document obsoletes RFC 4071, RFC 4333, and RFC 7691.</t></abstract>
