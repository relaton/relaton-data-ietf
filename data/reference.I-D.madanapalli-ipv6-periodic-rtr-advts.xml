<abstract><t>Periodic IPv6 router advertisements are a concern in mobile and cellular networks in which the hosts are attached to the network and access router but switch state to dormant mode in order to conserve battery power. In addition the air interface is a resource that should be used optimally and hence periodic router advertisements that an access router would send should be limited. Transmission of Periodic router advertisements to hosts on a link by a router should be optional. At the very least the interval between such router advertisements should be configurable to a value that is significantly higher than currently specified. This document provides a recommendation for the periodic router advertisement interval (MaxRtrAdvInterval) and router lifetime.</t></abstract>
