<abstract><t>The management of data is entirely centralized on servers in a server client model which leads the servers to be high-value targets for adversaries.  Also, firmware consumers fail to download the latest firmware image if the author is disappeared in the server client model.  The distribution of network for managing the manifest and firmware image files thus required.
