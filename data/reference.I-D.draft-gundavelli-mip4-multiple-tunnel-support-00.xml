<abstract><t>This document defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol for allowing a mobile node or a mobile router with multiple interfaces to register a care-of address for each of the available interfaces and to simultaneously establish multiple Mobile IP tunnels to the home agent, each through a different interface path.  This capability is required for enabling a mobile node to utilize all the available wireless access links and build an higher aggregated data pipe to the home agent by setting the home address reachability over all of those tunnel paths.</t></abstract>
