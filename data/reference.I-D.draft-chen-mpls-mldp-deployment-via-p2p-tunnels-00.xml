<abstract><t>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to- Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths.  The existing specification for this functionality assumes that a pair of LDP neighbors which support the P2MP/MP2MP capability are directly connected.  However, the real deployment may not have all the nodes along the LSP path to be P2MP/MP2MP capable so that the CapEx of the deployment can be reduced or the deployment of the LDP P2MP/MP2MP can be in phases instead of updating the whole network. This document provides a solution for finding the first upstream node which supports the LDP P2MP/MP2MP along the path from the current node to the root node.</t></abstract>
