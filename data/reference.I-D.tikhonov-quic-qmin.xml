<abstract><t>This specification defines QMIN, a compression format and protocol for HTTP/2 ([RFC7540]) headers.  QMIN is based on HPACK ([RFC7541]). The modifications to HPACK are meant to allow robust compression use in QUIC: That is, no head-of-line blocking and low overhead.  QMIN is guided by HPACK design principles.  It inherits all of HPACK's data structures and retains binary compatibility with it.  While designed with QUIC in mind, QMIN can be used in other contexts.</t></abstract>
