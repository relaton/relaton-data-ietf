<abstract><t>Networks of low power wireless devices introduce novel IP routing issues.  Low-power wireless devices, such as sensors, actuators and smart objects, have difficult constraints: very limited memory, little processing power, and long sleep periods.  As most of these devices are battery-powered, energy efficiency is critically important.  Wireless link qualities can vary significantly over time, requiring protocols to make agile decisions yet minimize topology change energy costs.  Routing over such low power and lossy networks has novel requirements that existing protocols may not address.  This document provides a brief survey of the strengths and weaknesses of existing protocols with respect to this class of networks.  From this survey it examines whether existing and mature IETF protocols can be used without modification in these networks, or whether further work is necessary. is necessary.</t></abstract>
