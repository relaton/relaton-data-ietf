<abstract><t>This specification defines an application profile of the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization, to request and provision keying material in group communication scenarios that are based on CoAP and secured with Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE).  This application profile delegates the authentication and authorization of Clients that join an OSCORE group through a Resource Server acting as Group Manager for that group.  This application profile leverages protocol-specific transport profiles of ACE to achieve communication security, server authentication and proof-of-possession for a key owned by the Client and bound to an OAuth 2.0 access token.</t></abstract>
