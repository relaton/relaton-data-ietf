<abstract><t>The IETF has designed process changes over the last ten years in one of two ways -- announcement by the IESG, sometimes based on informal agreements with limited community involvement, and awareness, and formal use of same mechanism as is used for protocol specification. The first mechanism has often proven to be too lightweight, the second too heavyweight. There is a middle ground. This document proposes a middle-ground approach to the system of making changes to IETF process, one that relies heavily on a "propose and carry out an experiment, evaluate the experiment, and then establish permanent procedures based on operational experience" model rather than the ones that have been attempted previously.</t></abstract>
