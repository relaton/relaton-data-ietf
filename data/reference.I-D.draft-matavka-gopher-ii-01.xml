<abstract><t>The Gopher protocol is over twenty years old.  Changing practices and unofficial extensions have caused Gopher as currently used to differ, but remain largely compatible with, the standard established in its official governing document, *The Internet Gopher Protocol (a distributed document search and retrieval protocol)*, known as *RFC 1436*.  Therefore, this document attempts to establish a contemporary specification of the Gopher communications protocol, departing as little as possible from current practice.</t></abstract>
