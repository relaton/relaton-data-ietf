<abstract><t>Following the theme "Everything that can be connected will be connected", engineers and researchers designing smart object networks need to decide how to achieve this in practice.  How can different forms of embedded and constrained devices be interconnected?  How can they employ and interact with the currently deployed Internet?  This memo discusses smart objects and some of the architectural choices involved in designing smart object networks and protocols that they use.</t></abstract>
