<abstract><t>The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols such as Bundle Protocol and Licklider.  The specifications of these protocols contain fields that are subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the group created adhoc registries[DTNRGREG].  As the specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group would like to handoff the registries to IANA for official custidy.  This document describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA.</t></abstract>
