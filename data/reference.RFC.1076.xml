<abstract><t>This RFC specifies a query language for monitoring and control of network entities.  This RFC supercedes RFC 1023, extending the query language and providing more discussion of the underlying issues. This language is a component of the High-Level Entity Monitoring System (HEMS) described in RFC 1021 and RFC 1022.  Readers may wish to consult these RFCs when reading this memo.  RFC 1024 contains detailed assignments of numbers and structures used in this system.  Portions of RFC 1024 that define query language structures are superceded by definitions in this memo.  This memo assumes a knowledge of the ISO data encoding standard, ASN.1.</t></abstract>
