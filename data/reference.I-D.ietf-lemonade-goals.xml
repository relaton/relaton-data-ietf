<abstract><t>This document is a history capturing the background, motivation and thinking during the LEMONADE definition and design process. The LEMONADE Working Group -- Internet Messaging to support diverse service environments -- is chartered to provide enhancements to Internet mail to facilitate its use by more diverse clients. In particular, by clients on hosts not only operating in environments with high latency/bandwidth-limited unreliable links but also constrained to limited resources. The enhanced mail must be backwards compatible with existing Internet mail.</t></abstract>
