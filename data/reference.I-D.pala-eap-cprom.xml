<abstract><t>With the increase number of devices, protocols, and applications that rely on strong credentials (e.g., digital certificates, keys, or tokens) for network access, the need for a standard credentials provisioning layer is paramount.  In particular, since EAP is deployed for authentication needs, the authors extend this use-case by including support for provisioning and management of credentials.  In particular, this specification defines how to support the provisioning of strong credentials to users and/or devices without the need for providing IP connectivity.  The use of EAP not only for provisiong but also for managing network credentials provides a general conduit that can be exploited in different environments (e.g., Wired and WiFi networks credentials management).</t></abstract>
