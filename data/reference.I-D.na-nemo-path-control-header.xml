<abstract><t>In this memo, we propose a unified Route Optimization (RO) scheme that can solve several types of RO problem by using Path Control Header (PCH) Piggybacking. In our scheme, Home Agent (HA) does piggyback the PCH on the packet which is reversely forwarded from Mobile Router (MR). That enables any PCH-aware routing facility on the route to make a RO tunnel with MR using the Care-of address of MR contained in the PCH. By applying to some already known NEMO RO problems, we show that our scheme can incrementally optimize the routes via default HA-MR tunnel through the simple PCH interpretation.</t></abstract>
