<abstract><t>This document provides the entry point to the set of documentation on a new Congestion Exposure (ConEx) protocol.  It motivates a new ConEx field at the IP layer, focusing on the 'why' rather than the 'how'. In the absence of such a protocol, traffic is subjected to numerous traffic management checks and limits as it crosses the Internet.  The purpose of this protocol is to expose congestion to network operators, so that they have no need to intervene at all when there is no congestion, and so they have exactly the right information when there is congestion.  Then it will at least be possible for traffic management to be application-neutral, openly transparent and free of unnecessary restraints.  Although traffic management is the focus of this document, it also briefly introduces a number of other important potential uses for ConEx, demonstrating its role as a generative technology and justifying its placement in the IP layer.</t></abstract>
