<author initials='G.' surname='Zorn' fullname='G. Zorn'><organization /></author>
<date year='2001' month='March' />
<abstract><t>This document describes the method used to derive initial MPPE session keys from a variety of credential types.  It is expected that this memo will be updated whenever Microsoft defines a new key derivation method for MPPE, since its primary purpose is to provide an open, easily accessible reference for third-parties wishing to interoperate with Microsoft products.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
