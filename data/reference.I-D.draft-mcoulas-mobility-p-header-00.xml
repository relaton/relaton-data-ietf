<abstract><t>Voice call continuity and media over IP session mobility operations are typically characterized by the movement of a specific segment of a communication session across networks and/or devices. This movement may be implemented through the use of SIP procedures that result in the establishment of a new segment replacing the existing segment. This document proposes a private extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enable User Agents (UA) to indicate that a SIP request is associated with a mobility operation for an existing session.</t></abstract>
