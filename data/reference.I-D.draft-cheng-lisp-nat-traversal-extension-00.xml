<abstract><t>This draft specifies several special NAT traversal scenarios when two or more LISP Sites/MNs which locate behind the same NAT equipment communicate with each other.  When these LISP Sites/MNs communicate with each other, it may cause routing latency and will increase re- encapsulation load on Re-encapsulating Tunnel Routers(RTRs) based on existing LISP-NAT strategy.  In this draft, we give detail descriptions of these scenarios.  Also we propose some suggestions to solve the problems.  According to our strategy, a new kind of message is used for RTRs to send relative information of Corresponding Sites/MNs to xTRs.</t></abstract>
