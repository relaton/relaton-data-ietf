<abstract><t>This memo describes conventions for exchange and presentation of text in SIP sessions through the Message Session Relay Protocol MSRP.  It covers two different methods for taking the initiative to transmit. These methods are timer initiated real-time text and user requested en-bloc transmission in Messaging.  The document gives specific guidance on handling of text presentation and presentation control of conversational sessions.  It specifies how the capability to conduct MSRP sessions with real-time text is declared so that session negotiation can make decisions on what transport protocol to use and how to route the calls to get the desired support for text communication.</t></abstract>
