<title>Host extensions for IP multicasting</title>

<abstract><t>This memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation of the Internet Protocol (IP) to support multicasting.  IP multicasting is the transmission of an IP datagram to a &quot;host group&quot;, a set hosts identified by a single IP destination address.  A multicast datagram is delivered to all members of its destination host group with the same &quot;best-efforts&quot; reliability as regular unicast IP datagrams.  It is proposed as a standard for IP multicasting in the Internet.  This specification is a major revision of RFC-988.</t></abstract>
