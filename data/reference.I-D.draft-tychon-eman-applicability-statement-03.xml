<abstract><t>The objective of Energy Management (EMAN) is to provide an energy management framework for networked devices. In this document the applicability of the EMAN framework for a variety of network scenarios is presented. This document lists a number of use cases and the target devices that can potentially implement the EMAN framework and the associated MIB modules. Thus, these use cases be useful to identity additional monitoring requirements that need to be considered so that EMAN can provide a solution for those use cases. Furthermore, we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to other energy monitoring standards and architectures.</t></abstract>
