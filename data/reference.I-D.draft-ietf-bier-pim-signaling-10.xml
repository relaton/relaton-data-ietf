<abstract><t>Consider large networks deploying traditional PIM multicast service. Typically, each portion of these large networks have their own mandates and requirements.  It might be desirable to deploy BIER technology in some part of these networks to replace traditional PIM services.  In such cases downstream PIM states need to be signaled over BIER Domain toward the source.  This draft explains the procedure to signal PIM joins and prunes through a BIER Domain, as such enable provisioning of traditional PIM services through a BIER Domain.</t></abstract>
