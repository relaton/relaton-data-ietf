<abstract><t>Bluetooth protocol suite defines a set of security mechanisms between its devices. All the authentication procedure is based on the knowledge of a shared secret called PIN. Bluetooth suggests to use systems such as Diffie-Hellman method or others else to initiate the PIN between two unknown devices.
