<abstract><t>LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide local in-network loss recovery.  It can be used with tunneling protocols to efficiently recover lost packets on a single segment of an end-to-end path instead of leaving recovery to the end-to-end protocol, traversing the entire path.  [I-D.welzl-loops-gen-info] defines the information to be carried between LOOPS ingress and egress nodes in a generic way, giving a guideline on defining the common elements to embed LOOPS functions in various tunnel protocols.  The present document specifies how to embed LOOPS in the overlay tunnel protocol chosen for the initial LOOPS specification, Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].</t></abstract>
