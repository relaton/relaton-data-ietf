<abstract><t>This document proposes protection methods for the BIER-TE architecture [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].  These include 1+1 (live-live) path/tree [RFC7431] redundancy, 1:1 path/tree protection, as well as fast reroute (FRR) methods.  The latter may protect against link and/ or node failures and leverage infrastructure tunnels, BIER-in-BIER encapsulation, or header modification for implementation.  In particular, this memo describes FRR for BIER-TE in detail.  FRR for BIER-TE requires support from the BIER-TE controller and the BFRs that are attached to a link/adjacency for which FRR protection is desired.  FRR relies on the BIER header described in [RFC8279] which is also used by BIER-TE.  It does not require extensions or modifications to existing BIER-TE tables.  However, the presented FRR procedures need some additional forwarding plane logic on the BFR. An additional table is needed that carries information about pre- computed backup paths.  When a failure is detected, the information from this table is used to modify the bitstring in the BIER header before forwarding a packet over a backup path.  To prevent undesired packet duplication, packets should be tunneled on the backup paths.</t></abstract>
