<abstract><t>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (RFC1350) is a simple, lock-step, file transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a Local Area Network. TFTP has been used for this application because it is very simple to implement. The Employment of a lock-step scheme limits throughput when used on a LAN.  This document describes a TFTP option which allows the client and server to negotiate a window size of consecutive blocks to send as an alternative for replacing the single block lock-step schema. The TFTP option mechanism employed is described in TFTP Option Extension (RFC2347).</t></abstract>
