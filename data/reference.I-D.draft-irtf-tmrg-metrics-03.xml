<abstract><t>This document discusses the metrics to be considered in an evaluation of new or modified congestion control mechanisms for the Internet. This includes metrics for the evaluation of new transport protocols, of proposed modifications to TCP, of application-level congestion control, and of Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanisms in the router. This document is intended to be the first in a series of documents aimed at improving the models that we use in the evaluation of transport protocols. This document is a product of the Transport Modeling Research Group (TRMG), and has received detailed feedback from several members of the Research Group (RG). We are not aware of any controversies regarding the content of this document.</t></abstract>
