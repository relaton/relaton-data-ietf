<abstract><t>DNS-SD allows a client to find a list of named instances of a service name over a particular transport within a domain of interest using standard DNS queries.  As the number of potential responders increases, DNS-SD based discovery doesn't scale well.  To mitigate the scaling issues, schemes to narrow down the search context would be needed.  The document proposes to include key/value pairs in the form of a DNS TXT record along with the service name in the DNS query to assist with the discovery process.  The DNS TXT record can be placed in the additional section of the query without requiring any changes to the structure of DNS messages.</t></abstract>
