<abstract><t>With the boom of Multi-CDN services, more enterprises tend to apply Multi-CDN service to deliver better end user experience to online global audiences.  However, the current Multi-CDN strategy has some defects.  Different Multi-CDN providers have various implementations of CDN balancing, yet there is no such unified DNS protocol because that multiple CNAMEs violates DNS standards.  Some Multi-CDN implementations MAY have extra lookups for CDN redirection which causes longer query latency.  This document aims to provide an exclusive DNS RR type CDNNAME(CDN name) for Multi-CDN implementation.</t></abstract>
