<abstract><t>In traditional telecommunication system, operators usually provide general and limited security protection service for users during access (e.g. AKA in 3G/4G network). Now, with the development of network virtualization technology and data center, the physical network device is became a network function software which is running on virtual machine of server and the network functions can be flexible and elastic. So operators can provide more flexible security function to users.  In order to provide more flexible security service, interfaces between operator's network and user should be needed.  These interfaces will be used to request/achieve operate (Virtual) Network Security Functions from operator's network. This draft describes use cases for using the interface in operator's network environment.</t></abstract>
