<abstract><t>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography will come uncertainty about the strength of cryptographic primitives.  For example; when will RSA and ECC fall?  Are Lattice schemes as strong as we believe?  The cryptographic community is calling for hybrid schemes that combine classic and post-quantum crypto in ways that remain strong so long as at least one of the algorithms used remains strong.  This document defines the problem statement for digital signatures in PKIX protocols, and gives an overview of the general families of solutions.</t></abstract>
