<abstract><t>This document provides the method that autonomously and dynamically schedules TSCH slotframe based on the current traffic load. In the introduction part, we introduce some basic knowledge on TSCH and RPL. After this, we introduce some existing TSCH schedulers and their limitations. They are classified as centralized, distributed, and autonomous. Then, we propose a novel autonomous and dynamic TSCH cell scheduler. With this, each node schedules its own TSCH slotframe and allocates additional cells based on the current traffic load without any negotiation or traffic overhead. Since they allocate additional cells only when needed, energy efficient operation can be achieved simultaneously.</t></abstract>
