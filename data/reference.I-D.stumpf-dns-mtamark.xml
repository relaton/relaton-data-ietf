<abstract><t>In contrast to other more extensive approaches to deal with unsolicited email, commonly called "spam", this memo discusses a very simple authentication scheme. It uses marking of hosts in reverse DNS (IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA zones) to allow the receiving mail transfer agents to decide whether the connecting (sending) host is a designated mail transfer agent (MTA) or not. Despite being a weaker scheme than most of the other proposals currently discussed, it can reduce the amount of spam and viruses/ worms significantly and has the advantage that it can be implemented based on existing and well-established Internet technology like DNS without any changes to that technology. This document is part of the LMAP work of the Anti-Spam Research Group (ASRG) of the IRTF.</t></abstract>
