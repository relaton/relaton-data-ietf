<abstract><t>The absence of appropriate mechanisms for information exchange between Network Operators and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and content providers leads to avoidable inefficiency for the delivery of contents to end users in situations like congestion, selection of best distributed delivery end point, etc.  This document describes the need of an information exchange interface between Network Operators and CDNs to collaborate in order to provide the best service quality to the end users.</t></abstract>
