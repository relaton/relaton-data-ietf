<abstract><t>The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), and related extensions are intended to support machine-to-machine communication in systems where one or more nodes are resource constrained, in particular for low power wireless sensor networks.  This document defines a publish- subscribe Broker for CoAP that extends the capabilities of CoAP for supporting nodes with long breaks in connectivity and/or up-time.  There is work in progress to resolve some of the transfer layer issues by using a more RESTful approach.  Please see https://github.com/core-wg/pubsub/blob/master/proposal.txt</t></abstract>
