<abstract><t>This document specifies NAT44 [RFC3022] with Large Scale NAT [draft-ietf-behave-lsn-requirements-02] integration options along with production model experience.  The NAT44/LSN implementation is associated with the NAT444 [draft-shirasaki-nat444-04] model. Service Providers are preparing for IPv4 address depletion by enabling IPv6 and/or extending connectivity for IPv4 to support legacy Internet end points.  This document provides practical integration options for Large Scale NAT systems which enable provider NAT44 and is applicable primarily to service providers.  The document does not intend to argue the merits of NAT444 versus other IPv4 run out technology options.</t></abstract>
