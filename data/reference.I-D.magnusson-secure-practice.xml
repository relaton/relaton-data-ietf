<abstract><t>IETF members is per tradition a focused group, working with all aspects of network interconnectivity and processing. But, as requested by the IETF Security Chair at IETF-75, there is an emerging need of a more formal review of Information Security issues, in relation to the IETF Standard work.  During IETF-75, the author noted in several sessions participants voicing a somewhat different view on security issues, compared to what I have experienced as norm and practice within several End-Users organizations. Some key practices, often dependent on rulesets as SOX "Best Practice" framework, seemed to not be to well-known in those discussions I attended. This document intends to, with some simple examples, review and highlight some effects of these gaps and questions they arises.</t></abstract>
