<abstract><t>The document describes several use cases of peering of non-VoIP services between two or more Service Providers.  These Service Providers create a peering relationship between themselves thus enabling their users to collaborate with users on the other Service Provider network.  The target of the document is to drive requirements for peering between domains that provide the non-VoIP based collaboration services and presence and Instant Messaging (IM) in particular.</t></abstract>
