<abstract><t>This document introduces the experimental extension to User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - Extendable User Datagram Protocol (EUDP) - that allows to extend its header (and, therefore, functionality) by options.  Such solution lets the client to choose what features will be provided and what will not, and, therefore, is more liberal than, for instance, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), that make use of many functions mandatory, but may be more complicated than UDP, since may provide other needed functions, except only core transport features.</t></abstract>
