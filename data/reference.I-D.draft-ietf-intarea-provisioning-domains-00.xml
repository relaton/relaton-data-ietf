<abstract><t>An increasing number of hosts and networks are connected to the Internet through multiple interfaces, some of which may provide multiple ways to access the internet by means of multiple IPv6 prefix configurations.  This document describes a way for hosts to retrieve additional information about their network access characteristics.  The set of configuration items required to access the Internet is called a Provisioning Domain (PvD).  The PvD is identified by a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  This identifier, retrieved using a new Router Advertisement (RA) option, is associated with the set of information included within the RA and may later be used to retrieve additional information associated with the PvD by way of an HTTP- over-TLS request.</t></abstract>
