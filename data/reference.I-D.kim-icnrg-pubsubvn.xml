<abstract><t>As autonomous vehicle is becoming a major research in automotive engineering, the importance of vehicular network is also increasing. Content-oriented vehicular network requires new communication architecture that is different from the existing IP-based architecture. ICN is one of the best alternatives for vehicular network to serve as communication infrastructure. ICN only supports pull-based communication. Therefore, an efficient communication method is needed for disseminating safety information for vehicles, and the publish/subscribe(pub/sub) system can be a good alternative. This document proposes a pub/sub service architecture and procedures for disseminating safety information between vehicles and infrastructure.</t></abstract>
