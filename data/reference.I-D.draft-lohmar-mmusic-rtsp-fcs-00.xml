<abstract><t>RTSP defines the setup and control for on demand and live streaming media sessions, which are delivered via an external media transport protocol such as RTP/UDP.  RTSP does not define a mechanism to change the content during an on-going streaming session.  Such a mechanism improves the streaming experience when a user browses through multiple offerings on a single streaming site.  This document describes several methods to improve content switching. The basic principle is to re-use already established transport sessions (e.g.  RTP/UDP sessions) and negotiate new content to be delivered on the existing sessions.  If additional transport sessions are necessary, those sessions are established separately.  This principle of re-using the RTSP control and transport sessions decreases the content switch delay to a large extent and improves the end-user experience.  The present document defines a mechanism for switching to new content, both when the client already has the content description available and when it does not.  This document additionally considers switching of a single media stream in a session, when several alternative media components are available.  For instance, the content may provide several alternate audio tracks in different languages to be played with a single video stream.  The principle of Fast Content Switching and Start-up is also defined in 3GPP TS 26.234 [3GPP.26.234] for RTSP 1.0 [RFC2326].</t></abstract>
