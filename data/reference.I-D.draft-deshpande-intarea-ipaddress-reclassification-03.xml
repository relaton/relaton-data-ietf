<abstract><t>This draft proposes IP address reclassification. By understanding how the Network is evolving from wireless technologies and comparing with an abstract mathematical topological space model, changes such as addition of a Virtual address space and Virtual BGP neighborship are proposed. The limitations of current Internet Architecture are identified and the corrections needed for the traffic bottleneck present in the current Internet Architecture are described further. The interdependence of IPv6 ULA addressing scheme, multipath and multipath TCP with the virtual neighborship and the virtual address space are explored.</t></abstract>
