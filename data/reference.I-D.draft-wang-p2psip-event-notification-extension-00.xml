<abstract><t>The p2p technology is data centric, where the data objects are distributed in the p2p overlay according to the routing algorithm. Applications access the data objects via peer/client protocol or gateways, and some of them require data replicas to be synchronized in real time, such as a data object stored in overlay and its cache copy in client memory. This can be achieved by introducing an event notification extension to p2p protocol. This document describes the subscribe/notify mechanism for p2psip and define several new methods to implement such extension.</t></abstract>
