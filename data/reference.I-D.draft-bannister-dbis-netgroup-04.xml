<abstract><t>This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS) described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support netgroup and netservice databases.  A netgroup database schema SHALL be backwards compatible with the Network Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries so that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510].  A netgroup database represents groups of hosts, users and domains.  A netservice database schema is a new extension to netgroups that allows administrators to describe services or configuration options for a user or system based upon their netgroup membership.  This document describes configuration maps [draft-bannister-dbis- mapping-00] for netgroup and netservice databases, and database entries referenced by those maps.</t></abstract>
