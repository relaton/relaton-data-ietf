<abstract><t>In PIM-SM shared networks, there is typically more than one upstream router. When duplicate data packets appear on the LAN from different routers, assert packets are sent from these routers to elect a single forwarder. The PIM assert packets are sent periodically to keep the assert state. The PIM assert packet carries information about a single multicast source and group, along with the metric-preference and metric of the route towards the source or RP. This document defines a standard to send and receive multiple multicast source and group information in a single PIM assert packet in a shared network. This can be particularly helpful when there is traffic for a large number of multicast groups.</t></abstract>
