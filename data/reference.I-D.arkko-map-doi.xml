<abstract><t>The Mobile Application Part (MAP) protocol is a signaling protocol for cellular networks. The MAP Security (MAPSEC) protocol provides a secure way to transport MAP messages. To use MAPSEC, however, Security Associations (SAs) are needed. This document defines how such SAs can be created automatically. We use the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) as a framework for managing SAs and establishing keys. The framework can be specialized to a particular task. Such a specialization is called a Domain of Interpretation (DOI), and this document defines the MAPSEC DOI. This specialization is very similar to the Internet Key Exchange protocol and the ISAKMP specialization for IP Security, except that non-IP protocols are being negotiated.</t></abstract>
