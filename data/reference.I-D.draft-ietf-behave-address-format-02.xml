<abstract><t>This document discusses the algorithmic translated to a corresponding IPv4 address, and vice versa, using only statically configured information.  It defines a Well-Known Prefix for use in algorithmic translations, while allowing organizations to also use Network Specific Prefixes when appropriate.  Algorithmic translation is used in IPv4/IPv6 translators, as well as other types of proxies and gateways (e.g., for DNS) used in IPv4/IPv6 scenarios.
