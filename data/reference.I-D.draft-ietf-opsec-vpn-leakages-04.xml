<abstract><t>The subtle way in which the IPv6 and IPv4 protocols co-exist in typical networks, together with the lack of proper IPv6 support in popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) products, may inadvertently result in VPN traffic leaks.  That is, traffic meant to be transferred over an encrypted and integrity protected VPN connection may leak out of such connection and be sent in the clear on the local network towards the final destination.  This document discusses some scenarios in which such VPN leakages may occur as a result of employing IPv6-unaware VPN software.  Additionally, this document offers possible mitigations for this issue.</t></abstract>
