<abstract><t>Data source authentication is an important requirement to provide multicast security. Data source authentication assures that the member claiming to send the data is the actual sender. An imposter member should not be able to claim to be the sender of the data. This document proposes a scheme by which data source authentication can be acheived. This approach does not use digital signatures or assume any time synchronization between the sender and the receivers. Instead of directly authenticating a multicast communication, it is split into a 1-to-1 authenticated unicast to GCKS followed by an authenticated multicast by GCKS. Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are used instead of digital signatures in both the authenticated unicast and the authenticated multicast.</t></abstract>
