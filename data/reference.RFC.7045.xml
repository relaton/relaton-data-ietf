<abstract><t>Various IPv6 extension headers have been standardised since the IPv6 standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to clarify how intermediate nodes should deal with such extension headers and with any that are defined in the future.  It also specifies how extension headers should be registered by IANA, with a corresponding minor update to RFC 2780.</t></abstract>
