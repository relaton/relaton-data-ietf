<abstract><t>This memo describes a method of protecting TCP connections against off-path, third party spoofing attacks, by making use of the TCP Timestamps option specified in RFC1323. The original basis of the idea was proposed by Kacheong Poon. This memo discusses its issues to add complementary ideas to his original approach. Viable ideas in this memo will be incorporated into his upcoming draft.</t></abstract>
