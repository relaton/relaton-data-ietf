<abstract><t>This document describes an architecture of the Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework which enables traffic steering between Network Security Functions (NSFs) for security policy enforcement.  Such traffic steering enables the composite inspection of network traffic by steering the traffic through multiple types of security functions according to the information model for the NSF- facing interface in the I2NSF framework.  This document explains the additional components integrated into the I2NSF framework and their functionalities to achieve NSF-triggered traffic steering.  It also describes representative use cases to address major benefits from the proposed architecture.</t></abstract>
