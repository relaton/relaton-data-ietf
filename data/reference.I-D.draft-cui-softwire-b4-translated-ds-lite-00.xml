<abstract><t>The well known Dual Stack lite (DS-lite) technology does great contribution to the deployment of IPv6 and alleviate the shortage of IPv4 address by making it possible to share a single IPv4 address between many hosts.  However, the original DS-lite model make AFTR the bottleneck of whole system, thus AFTR's efficiency limits the capability of whole DS-lite model.  This draft proposes a B4- translated Ds-lite to alleviate the burden of AFTR so that AFTR is able to serve more B4s.</t></abstract>
