<abstract><t>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support the next generation of the pan European in- vehicle emergency call service defined under the eSafety initiative of the European Commission (generally referred to as "eCall"). eCall is a standardized and mandated system for a special form of emergency calls placed by vehicles, providing real-time communications and an integrated set of related data.  This document also registers MIME Content Types and an Emergency Call Additional Data Block for the eCall vehicle data and metadata/control data, and an INFO package to enable carrying this data in INFO requests.</t></abstract>
