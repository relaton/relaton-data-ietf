<abstract><t>A long long time ago Data Encryption Standard (DES) was standardized. Some 30 years later (2003) is was withdrawn as a standard by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), today 6 years later, its time for DES to finally die.  By 2008 it was possible to brute force DES keys in 6.4 days using less than USD 10k worth of hardware. So by 2008 DES had passed its sell-by date.  This document updates RFC1964, RFC4120, and RFC4121 to deprecate the use of DES in Kerberos.</t></abstract>
