<abstract><t>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops. TRILL supports the multi-pathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) link state routing and encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a hop count.  The ESADI (End System Address Distribution Information) protocol is a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) scoped way that RBridge can communicate end station addresses to each other.  An RBridge announcing VLAN-x connectivity (normally a VLAN-x forwarder) and running the TRILL ESADI protocol can receive remote address information and/or transmit local address information for VLAN-x to other such RBridges.  The purpose of this document is to improve and update the documentation of the ESADI protocol. It updates RFC 6325. The ESADI RBridge instance states, DRB (Designated RBridge) election procedure, and ESADI sub-TLV are specified in this document.</t></abstract>
