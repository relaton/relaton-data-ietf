<abstract><t>In this document we propose a revision to the BGP route selection rules that would avoid unnecessary best path transitions between external paths under certain conditions. The proposed revision would help the overall network stability, and more importantly, would eliminate certain BGP route oscillations in which more than one external paths from one BGP speaker contribute to the churn.</t></abstract>
