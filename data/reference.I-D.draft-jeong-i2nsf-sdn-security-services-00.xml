<abstract><t>This document provides requirements for security services based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with two representative use cases: (i) centralized firewall system for intra-domain networks and (ii) centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system between inter-domain networks.  For the centralized firewall system, this document raises challenging issues in existing firewalls and a use case of centralized firewall system based on SDN.  For the centralized DDoS- attack mitigation system, this document also raises challenging issues in existing DDoS-attack mitigation techniques and a use case of centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system based on SDN.</t></abstract>
