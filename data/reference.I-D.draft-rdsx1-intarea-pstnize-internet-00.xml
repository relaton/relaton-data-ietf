<abstract><t>This draft discusses the features and functions that the Internet must support in order to be as robust and trustworthy as the public switched telephone network (PSTN, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Public_switched_telephone_network).  In general the PSTN-like features and functions include verifiable addressing and numbering, higher privacy and security, increased reliability (no more than around five minutes of unplanned outage over one year time period), survivability and resiliency, desirable level of scalability, alarms, correlation, and diagnosis capability, and local/international level of accountability.  Incorporation of these (or similar) features are expected to harden the Internet.  The topics related to Internet hardening were discussed during IETF88 technical plenary (http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/88/technical- plenary.html) in Vancouver, BC, Canada in Nov. 2013.  A follow-up joint W3C/IAB workshop on strengthening the Internet against pervasive monitoring (STRINT, https://www.w3.org/2014/strint) was held before IETF89 meeting in London, UK.  During the IETF90 Technical Plenary Session (http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/90/minutes/minutes-90-iab- techplenary) on Monday, 21 July 2014 in Toronto, Canada the Technical Topic discussion focused on Network topology and geography.  The presentations revealed that for business relationship and/or policy reasons, local traffic routinely cross national borders for so called 'efficient' routing, thereby facilitating monitoring, copying, and surveillance of traffic from users' sessions by both authorized and unauthorized entities.  All of the technical presentations are available at the website of IETF90 proceedings(http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/90/slides/slides-90-iab- techplenary-9.pdf).  In this draft, we discuss the requirements for PSTNization of Internet interfaces, protocols, services, and management and configuration capabilities.  NOTE: We are looking for additional contributors to update the contents of Section 2 to Section 6.  If you are interested, please send an email to draft-rdsx1-intarea-pstnize-internet@tools.ietf.org with the relevant Section Number and Section Title in the Subject line of your email with an estimated completion time.</t></abstract>
