<abstract><t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a text-based protocol for initiating and managing communication sessions. The protocol is extended by the SIP-events framework to provide, e.g., subscriptions and notifications to presence information that are carried in presence documents. SIP can be compressed by using Signaling Compression (SigComp), which is enhanced by using the SIP/SDP dictionary to achieve better compression rates. However, the SIP/SDP dictionary is not able to increase the compression factor of (typically lengthy) presence documents. This memo defines the presence-specific static dictionary that SigComp may use in order to achieve higher efficiency. The dictionary is compression algorithm independent.</t></abstract>
