<abstract><t>This document builds on the GMPLS overlay model [RFC4208] and defines extensions to the GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) to support route diversity within the core network for sets of LSPs initiated by edge nodes. A particular example where route diversity within the core network is desired, are dual-homed edge nodes. The document also defines GMPLS UNI extensions to deal with latency requirements for edge node initiated LSPs.  This document is also applicable to the L1VPN framework [RFC4847] to extend the L1VPN from the basic mode to the enhanced mode by including additional constraints, focusing upon the overlay extension service model. Route Diversity for customer LSPs are common requirement applicable to L1VPNs. This document describes L1VPN compatible mechanisms to achieve diversity for sets of customer LSPs. The extended overlay service model can support other extensions for L1VPN signaling, for example, those related to latency requirements.</t></abstract>
