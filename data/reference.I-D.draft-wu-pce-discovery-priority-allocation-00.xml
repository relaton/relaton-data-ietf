<abstract><t>Each network domain may contain multiple PCE servers.  It provides redundancy to the PCCs in the event of a server failure.  However load balance decision is made by PCC,it doesn't enable real load balance across the PCE servers if PCC still tries PCE one by one and PCE doesn't indicate the load status to the PCC.  This document proposes new PCE discovery sub-TLV that can be announced as attribute in the OSPF advertisement (defined in [RFC5088 ]) to distribute priority information.</t></abstract>
