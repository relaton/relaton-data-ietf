<abstract><t>This document describes a convention for sending "a=ssrc" attributes in SDP together with "a=simulcast" attributes.  This allows SFUs that need SSRC information to have this info easily accessible.  Given that it is intended as an interim measure, it does not aim for being published as an RFC.</t></abstract>
