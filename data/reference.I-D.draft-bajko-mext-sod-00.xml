<abstract><t>The Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 protocols only provide a means to secure the user plane traffic but do not provide any mechanisms by which the security is triggered as a result of mobility or the MN attaching via different access networks.  This document proposes extensions to Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 protocols, allowing the Mobile Node to signal to the Home Agent its preference for user plane traffic security, and for the Home Agent to override that preference based on policy settings.</t></abstract>
