<abstract><t>This document defines extensions to the current sockets API for Host Identity Protocol (HIP).  The extensions focus on the use of public- key based identifiers discovered via DNS resolution, but define also interfaces for manual bindings between HITs and locators.  With the extensions, the application can also support more relaxed security models where the communication can be non-HIP based, according to local policies.  The extensions in document are experimental and provide basic tools for futher experimentation with policies.</t></abstract>
