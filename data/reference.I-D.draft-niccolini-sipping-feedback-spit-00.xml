<abstract><t>This memo describes requirements and gives an overview of possible solutions to send feedbacks using the SIP protocol for the scope of SPIT (SPam over Internet Telephony) identification. Feedback information from the users to the SPIT identification system (e.g., working closely with the callee's SIP proxy server) are important for SPIT detection and prevention and the overall system could benefit from such information and increase its effectiveness. The basic idea is that each user who receives a SPIT call reports it to the SPIT identification system (for example, using a button on the user interface of the client). This memo identifies the parameters that the SPIT identification system may need in order to detect abusive behaviors; moreover it proposes an overview of technical solutions how such information can be sent back to the SPIT identification system by means of the SIP protocol.</t></abstract>
