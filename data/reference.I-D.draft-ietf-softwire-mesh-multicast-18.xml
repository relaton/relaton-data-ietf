<abstract><t>The Internet needs to support IPv4 and IPv6 packets.  Both address families and their related protocol suites support multicast of the single-source and any-source varieties.  During IPv6 transition, there will be scenarios where a backbone network running one IP address family internally (referred to as internal IP or I-IP), while the attached client networks running another IP address family (referred to as external IP or E-IP).  The I-IP backbone should offer both unicast and multicast transit services to the client E-IP networks.  Softwire Mesh is a solution providing E-IP unicast and multicast support across an I-IP backbone.  This document describes the mechanism for supporting Internet-style multicast across a set of E-IP and I-IP networks supporting softwire mesh.  We focus on IPv4- over-IPv6 scenario in this document, due to lack of real-world use cases for IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario.</t></abstract>
