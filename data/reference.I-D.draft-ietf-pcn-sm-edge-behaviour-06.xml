<abstract><t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting the quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain.  The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559.  This memo is one of a series describing possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN-domain.  The behaviour described here is that for a form of measurement-based load control using two PCN marking states, not- marked, and excess-traffic-marked.  This behaviour is known informally as the Single Marking (SM) PCN-boundary-node behaviour.</t></abstract>
