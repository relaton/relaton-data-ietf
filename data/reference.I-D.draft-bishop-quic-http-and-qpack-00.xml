<abstract><t>HTTP/2 [RFC7540] uses HPACK [RFC7541] for header compression. However, HPACK relies on the in-order message-based semantics of the HTTP/2 framing layer in order to function.  Messages can only be successfully decoded if processed by the receiver in the same order as generated by the sender.  This draft refines HPACK to loosen the ordering requirements for use over QUIC [I-D.hamilton-quic-transport-protocol] and describes changes to [I-D.shade-quic-http2-mapping] to leverage the new compression.</t></abstract>
