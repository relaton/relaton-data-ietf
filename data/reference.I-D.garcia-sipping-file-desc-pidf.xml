<abstract><t>The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic format for representing presence information for a presentity.  Presentities publish their presence information, typically towards presence agents.  PIDF has been extended to provide rich presence information, including, for example, the location of the presentity, their activities, mood, the capabilities of their user agents, etc. Presentities are willing to provide the description of available files at watcher's disposal.  This might be the case for photographs taken with a mobile device, a recorded lecture audio file, etc.  This document extends the PIDF to provide the syntax and format for the description of files within the PIDF.</t></abstract>
