<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  CoAP is based on datagram transport, which limits the maximum size of resource representations that can be transferred without too much fragmentation.  The Block option provides a minimal way to transfer larger representations in a block-wise fashion.  This short I-D extracts the Block option from its previous home, the coap-misc draft.  This should enable to progress it separately.</t></abstract>
