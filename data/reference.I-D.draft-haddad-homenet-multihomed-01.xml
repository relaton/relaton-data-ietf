<abstract><t>So far, multihoming in Homenet must be supported by the hosts as there is no mean to use simultaneously the different ISPs of the Homenet without risking flow disruption.  In this memo, we propose to revise the way multihoming is conceived in Homenet by relying on the infrastructure instead of the hosts.  We also propose a high level solution that answers this particular problem.</t></abstract>
