<abstract><t>The Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) for Network Localized Mobility Management (NETLMM) is a single point of failure for the Localized Mobility Management Domain (LMMD) and a focal point for all mobile node (MN) traffic. These shortcomings can be addressed by distributing the MAP function equally among the Access Routers (ARs) in the LMMD and deploying hierarchically organized supporting nodes in the backhaul network. This document specifies a Hierarchical MAP (HMAP) and its use in operational delployments that support traffic distribution and fault tolerance. Solutions for both IPv4 and IPv6 are given.</t></abstract>
