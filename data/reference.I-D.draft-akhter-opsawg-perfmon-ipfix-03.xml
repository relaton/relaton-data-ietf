<abstract><t>There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance of RTP based applications.  This performance data provides information essential in validating service level agreements, fault isolation as well as early warnings of greater problems.  This document describes IPFIX Information Elements related to RTP performance measurement of network based applications.  In addition, to the performance information several non-metric information elements are also included to provide greater context to the reports.  The measurements use audio/video applications as a base but are not restricted to these class of applications.  These new IPFIX Information Elements can describe the entire duration of an RTP stream or a smaller time slice of it.</t></abstract>
