<abstract><t>These years, wireless technologies, including the application of 6LoWPAN protocol, are more and more been applied in industrial environment to improve productivity and safety of the plants. In spite of the fact that [RFC4944] has introduced the methods of transmitting IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks, industrial automation field, either process automation or factory automation, has its special characteristics and requirements. If 6LoWPAN is been used in industrial environment, some change SHOULD be made in the adaption layer. This document defines a Scheduling Header, to make the adaption layer meet the requirements of industrial scheduling for transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Additionally, this document also provides an application example of Scheduling Header.</t></abstract>
