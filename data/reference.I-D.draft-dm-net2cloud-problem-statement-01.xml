<abstract><t>This document describes common approaches deployed by enterprises for interconnection of workloads &amp; applications hosted in Cloud DCs with on-premises DCs &amp; branch offices. This document also describes some of the (network) problems that many enterprises face when they have workloads &amp; applications &amp; data split among hybrid data centers, especially for those enterprises with multiple sites that are already interconnected by VPNs (e.g. MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN) and leased lines.  Current operational problems in the field are examined to determine whether there is a need for enhancements to existing protocols or whether a new protocol is necessary to solve them.</t></abstract>
