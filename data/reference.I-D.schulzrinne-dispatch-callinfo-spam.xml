<abstract><t>Called parties often wish to decide whether to accept, reject or redirect calls based on the likely nature of the call.  For example, they may want to reject unwanted telemarketing or fraudulent calls, but accept emergency alerts from numbers not in their address book. This document describes SIP Call-Info parameters and a feature tag that allow originating, intermediate and terminating SIP entities to label calls as to their type, spam probability and references to additional information.</t></abstract>
