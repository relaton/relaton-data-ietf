<abstract><t>This document defines a protocol to securely assign a Pledge to an owner and to enroll it into the owner's network.  The protocol uses an artifact that is signed by the Pledge's manufacturer.  This artifact is known as a &quot;voucher&quot;.</t><t> This document builds upon the work in [RFC8366] and [BRSKI], but defines an encoding of the voucher in CBOR rather than JSON, and enables the Pledge to perform its transactions using CoAP rather than HTTPS.</t><t> The use of Raw Public Keys instead of X.509 certificates for security operations is also explained.</t></abstract>
