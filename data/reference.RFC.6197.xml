<abstract><t>Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) maps service identifiers and location information to service contact URIs.  If a LoST client wants to discover available services for a particular location, it will perform a &lt;listServicesByLocation&gt; query to the LoST server. However, the LoST server, in its response, does not provide context information; that is, it does not provide any additional information about the geographical region within which the returned list of services is considered valid.  Therefore, this document defines a Service List Boundary that returns a local context along with the list of services returned, in order to assist the client in not missing a change in available services when moving.  This document  defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
