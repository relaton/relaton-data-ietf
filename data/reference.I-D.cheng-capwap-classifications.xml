<abstract><t>This document describes classifications for wireless local area network (WLAN) functionality. The main benefit of a consistent system of classification is accommodating the diversity of WLAN designs as seen in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points framework. This draft describes policies with which classifications may be used. The document analyzes various WLAN architectures and recent standardization efforts to derive key requirements for a CAPWAP WLAN protocol. It is envisioned that protocol development based on these requirements will enable interoperability among the various WLAN designs.</t></abstract>
