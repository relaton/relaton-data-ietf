<abstract><t>The aim of this Internet Draft is to define a standard compliant security framework for Low-power and Lossy Networks, in order to enable the possibility to encrypt and authenticate messages exchanged by nodes at the MAC layer. The framework is fully compatible with both IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.4e standards and offers a wide range of security features to network architectures developed within the 6TiSCH Working Group. In particular, it offers: (i) different kinds of security architectures; (ii) an efficient mechanism for initializing a secure IEEE 802.15.4 domain; and (iii) a lightweight mechanism to negotiate link keys among devices.</t></abstract>
