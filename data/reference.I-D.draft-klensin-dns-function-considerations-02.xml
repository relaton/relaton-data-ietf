<abstract><t>The basic design of the Domain Name System was completed almost 30 years ago.  The last half of that period has been characterized by significant changes in requirements and expectations, some of which either require changes to how the DNS is used or that can be accommodated only poorly or not at all.  This document asks the question of whether it is time to either redesign and replace the DNS to match contemporary requirements and expectations (rather than continuing to try to design and implement incremental patches that are not fully satisfactory) or to draw some clear lines about functionality that is not really needed or that should be performed somewhere else.</t></abstract>
