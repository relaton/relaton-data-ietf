<abstract><t>This document defines Address Settlement by Peer-to-Peer (ASP), a peer-to-peer (P2P) binary signaling protocol for usage on the Internet. A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract hash table service between a set of cooperating peers that form the P2P network. ASP is designed to support a P2P Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) network, but it can be utilized by other applications with similar requirements. ASP introduces the notion of usages, which are a collection of data types that are required for a particular application. For SIP, these types include location, STUN and TURN servers. ASP defines a security model based on a certificate enrollment service that provides peers with unique identities. ASP also provides protocol extensibility and defines a migration methodology, allowing for major upgrades of the P2P network without service disruption.</t></abstract>
