<abstract><t>This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in the    ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for    improvements.  One of the services frequently neglected in computer    network design is a high-quality, time-of-day clock capable of    generating accurate timestamps with small errors compared to one-way    network delays.  Such a service would be useful for tracing the progress    of complex transactions, synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring    network performance and isolating problems.  In this memo one such clock    service design will be described and its performance assessed.  This    design has been incorporated as an integral part of the network routing    and control protocols of the Distributed Computer Network (DCnet)    architecture.</t></abstract>
