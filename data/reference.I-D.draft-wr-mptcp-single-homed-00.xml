<abstract><t>Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at the end- systems.  While this scenario is certainly becoming increasingly a reality (e.g. mobile devices), currently most end-systems are single- homed (e.g. residential broadband customers).  This memo describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to multipath TCP that are not available at the end-systems but somewhere within the network. This can be thought of as a form of proxy multi-homing.</t></abstract>
