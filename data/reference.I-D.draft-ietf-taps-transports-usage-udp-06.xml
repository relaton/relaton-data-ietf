<abstract><t>This is an informational document that describes the transport protocol interface primitives provided by the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and the Lightweight User Datagram Protocol (UDP-Lite) transport protocols.  It identifies the datagram services exposed to applications and how an application can configure and use the features offered by the Internet datagram transport service.  RFCxxxx documents the usage of transport features provided by IETF transport protocols, describing the way UDP, UDP-Lite and other transport protocols expose their services to applications and how an application can configure and use the features that make up these services.  This document provides input to and context for that document, as well as offering a road map to documentation that may be of help to users of the UDP and UDP-Lite protocols.  XXX RFC-Ed Note - please replace RFCxxxx with the published RFC number for I-D.ietf-taps-transports-usage, when these documents are both published XXX.</t></abstract>
