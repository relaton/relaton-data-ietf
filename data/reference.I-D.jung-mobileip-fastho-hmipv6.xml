<abstract><t>This document addresses Fast Handover over HMIPv6 networks. The MIPv6 mobility could be more enhanced by combining FMIPv6 with HMIPv6, in which MIPv6 is benefited from all the advantages of the respective schemes. An additional benefit by combining FMIPv6 with HMIPv6 is that the overall handover latency in FMIPv6 will be more reduced since in HMIPv6 the MN sends a location update with the local MAP, rather than the HA and CN that are typically further way. This document describes how to use FMIPv6 for HMIPv6 (F-HMIPv6). The F-HMIPv6 is designed to be friendly with the data transport feature of HMIPv6. In F-HMIPv6, the tunnel for fast handover is established between MAP and NAR, rather than between PAR and NAR. For this purpose, the MN exchanges the FMIPv6 messages with MAP, not PAR. The F-HMIPv6 utilizes the FMIPv6 messages for handover support without further defining any new messages.</t></abstract>
