<abstract><t>This document primarily regards the difference between the intended configuration and the applied configuration of a device and how intended and applied configuration relate to the operational state of a device.  This document defines requirements for the applied configuration's data model and its values, as well as for enabling a client to know when a configuration has been fully applied or not, how to access operational state, and how to relate intended configuration nodes to applied configuration and derived state nodes.</t></abstract>
