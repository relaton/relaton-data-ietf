<abstract><t>There have been known issues with multicast, in an 802.11 environment, which have prevented the deployment of multicast in these wifi environments.  IETF multicast experts have been meeting together to discuss these issues and provide IEEE updates.  The mboned working group is chartered to receive regular reports on the current state of the deployment of multicast technology, create "practice and experience" documents that capture the experience of those who have deployed and are deploying various multicast technologies, and provide feedback to other relevant working groups. As such, this document will gather the problems of wifi multicast into one problem statement document so as to offer the community guidance on current limitations.</t></abstract>
