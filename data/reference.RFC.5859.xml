<abstract><t>This memo documents existing usage for the &quot;TFTP Server Address&quot; option.  The option number currently in use is 150.  This memo documents the current usage of the option in agreement with RFC 3942, which declares that any pre-existing usages of option numbers in the range 128-223 should be documented, and the Dynamic Host Configuration working group will try to officially assign those numbers to those options.  The option is defined for DHCPv4 and works only with IPv4 addresses.  This document is not an Internet Standards  Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
