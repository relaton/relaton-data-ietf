<abstract><t>This document presents a taxonomy of a set of &quot;Alternative Network                  Deployments&quot; that emerged in the last decade with the aim of bringing Internet connectivity to people or providing a local communication infrastructure to serve various complementary needs and objectives. They employ architectures and topologies different from those of mainstream networks and rely on alternative governance and business models.</t><t>The document also surveys the technologies deployed in these networks, and their differing architectural characteristics, including a set of definitions and shared properties.</t><t>The classification considers models such as Community Networks, Wireless Internet Service Providers (WISPs), networks owned by individuals but leased out to network operators who use them as a low-cost medium to reach the underserved population, networks that provide connectivity by sharing wireless resources of the users, and rural utility cooperatives.</t></abstract>
