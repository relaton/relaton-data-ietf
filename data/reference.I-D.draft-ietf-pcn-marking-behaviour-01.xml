<abstract><t>This document standardises the two marking behaviours of PCN-nodes: threshold marking and excess traffic marking.  Threshold marking marks all PCN-packets if the PCN traffic rate is greater than its configured rate.  Excess traffic marking marks a proportion of PCN- packets, such that the amount marked equals the traffic rate in excess of its configured rate.  Setting the configured rates below the physical link rates enables PCN-nodes to provide information to support admission control and flow termination in order to protect the quality of service of established inelastic flows.</t></abstract>
