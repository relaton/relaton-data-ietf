<abstract><t>This document is an attempt to consolidate terminology in the field privacy by data minimization.  It motivates and develops definitions for anonymity/identifiability, (un)linkability, (un)detectability, (un)observability, pseudonymity, identity, partial identity, digital identity and identity management.  Starting the definitions from the anonymity and unlinkability perspective and not from a definition of identity (the latter is the obvious approach to some people) reveals some deeper structures in this field.</t></abstract>
