<abstract><t>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has selected SIP [2]as the session establishment protocol for the 3GPP IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS). IMS is part of the Release 5 of the 3GPP specifications. Although SIP is a protocol that fulfills most of the requirements to establish a session in an IP network, SIP has never been evaluated against the specific 3GPP requirements for operation in a cellular network. In this document we express the requirements identified by 3GPP to support SIP for the Release 5 of the 3GPP IMS in cellular networks.</t></abstract>
