<abstract><t>The Centralized Conferencing Manipulation Protocol (CCMP) can create, retrieve, change and delete objects describing a centralized conference, such as state and capabilities of the conference, participants, and their roles.  The conference information is contained in XML documents and fragments conforming to the centralized conferencing data model schema.  Even though the goal of the CCMP is to appropriately manage conference state, the mechanisms upon which the protocol itself is built are based on a state-less request/response paradigm.  Conferencing clients send requests to conference servers, which respond to the client with the conference information.</t></abstract>
