<abstract><t>AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed at Carnegie Mellon University during the 1980s.  AFS-3 heavily leverages Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributed architecture.  This memo extends the volume management interface to support getting and setting of AFS volume attributes via an extensible Tag-Length-Value (TLV) encoding, which is based upon AFS-3 extensible discriminated unions.  TLV-based get and set RPCs are specified, along with a tag enumeration RPC.  In addition, tags are allocated for existing volume and transaction metadata, and implementation-private tags are allocated for metadata related to the OpenAFS Demand Attach File Server, and the RxOSD protocol suite.  Internet Draft Comments  Comments regarding this draft are solicited.  Please include the AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments.  AFS-3 Document State  This document is in state "draft", as per the document state definitions set forth in [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-standardisation].</t></abstract>
