<abstract><t>This specification defines a NAT that allows IPv6-only hosts that are inside the NAT to operate with IPv4 hosts that are outside the NAT. It requires no modifications to the v4 hosts or applications, or to the operating system of v6 hosts, but it does require some changes to v6 applications.  Typically this specification would be used to allow the hosts inside a NAT to connect to hosts outside it; but under some limitations, it can also allow hosts outside to connect to hosts inside. The goal of this draft is to consider what is the minimal feasible approach to this problem.  The draft is being discussed on the behave@ietf.org list.</t></abstract>
