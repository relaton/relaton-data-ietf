<abstract><t>This document describes how implementors of Mobile IPv6 can use IPv6-based network facilities to perform remote testing of their implementation with other groups participating in this testing program. The document aims to describe how one may become part of a testing group, what can be tested through this method, and the steps necessary to connect to remote Mobile IPv6 entities. This draft is not meant for deployment, and no change in Mobile IPv6 implementation is needed in order to participate in testing.</t></abstract>
