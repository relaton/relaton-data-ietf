<abstract><t>This document describe the scenarios where multiples early dialogs can be created.  The main use case is based on forking.  But also forwarding of SIP Invites and other applications may create early dialogs.  The scenarios shown describe how a correlation/multiplexing of multiple early dialogs caused by forked or forwarded INVITEs in Back to Back User Agents can apply.  Existing RFC's are analyzed how forking is described and points to facts which may be taken in to consideration.</t></abstract>
