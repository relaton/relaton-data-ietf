<abstract><t>RFC TBD describes a new model and set of requirements to implement a labeling system on Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) objects where the entity in charge of doing the label enforcement is under the control of a central authority rather than the recipient of the object.  This document describes a protocol to be used by senders and recipients of CMS objects to communicate with a centralized label enforcement server.  The document outlines how a client will get the set of labels or policies that it can use for sending messages, composes a secure CMS object with a label on it and gets the necessary keys to decrypt a CMS object from the server.  This document is designed to be used with RFC TBD2 which describes the extensions used in CMS objects to hold the label information.</t></abstract>
