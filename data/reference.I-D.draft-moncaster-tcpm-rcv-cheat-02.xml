<abstract><t>The TCP protocol relies on receivers sending accurate and timely feedback to the sender.  Currently the sender has no means to verify that a receiver is correctly sending this feedback according to the protocol.  A receiver that is non-compliant has the potential to disrupt a sender's resource allocation, increasing its transmission rate on that connection which in turn could adversely affect the network itself.  This document presents a two stage test process that can be used to identify whether a receiver is non-compliant.  The tests enshrine the principle that one shouldn't attribute to malice that which may be accidental.  The first stage test causes minimum impact to the receiver but raises a suspicion of non-compliance.  The second stage test can then be used to verify that the receiver is non-compliant.  This specification does not modify the core TCP protocol - the tests can either be implemented as a test suite or as a stand-alone test through a simple modification to the sender implementation.

Changes from previous drafts (to be removed by the RFC Editor)  From -01 to -02:  A number of changes made following an extensive review from Alfred  Hoenes.  These were largely to better comply with the stated aims  of the previous version but also included some tidying up of the  protocol details and a new section on a possible unwanted  interaction.  From -00 to -01:  Draft rewritten to emphasise testing for non-compliance.  Some  changes to protocol to remove possible unwanted interactions with  other TCP variants.  Sections added on comparison of solutions and  alternative uses of test.</t></abstract>
