<abstract><t>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired resource.  This document describes why a third-party ALTO server discovery mechanism is required for an important class of applications, namely tracker-based P2P applications.  Several solution approaches are classified and evaluated.  The conclusion is that further work is required to standardize a protocol and procedures that follow one specific approach.</t></abstract>
