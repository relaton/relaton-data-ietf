<abstract><t>The emergency services architecture developed in the IETF Emergency Context Resolution with Internet Technology (ECRIT) working group describes an architecture where location information is provided by access networks to end points in order to determine the correct dial string and information to route the call to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).  For determining the PSAP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) the usage of the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) Protocol is envisioned.  This document explores the architectural impact for the IETF emergency services architecture for situations where the Internet Access Provider (IAP) and/or the Internet Service Provider (ISP) are only willing to disclose limited or no location information.  This document provides a problem statement and lists requirements.</t></abstract>
