<abstract><t>Enterprise networks connect routers over various link types, and may also connect to provider networks and/or the global Internet. Enterprise network nodes require a means to automatically provision IP addresses/prefixes and support internetworking operation in a wide variety of use cases including Small Office, Home Office (SOHO) networks, Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), multi-organizational corporate networks and the interdomain core of the global Internet itself.  This document specifies a Virtual Enterprise Traversal (VET) abstraction for autoconfiguration and operation of nodes in enterprise networks.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification;  it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
