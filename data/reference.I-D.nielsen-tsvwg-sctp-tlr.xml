<abstract><t>Loss Recovery by means of T3-Retransmission has significant detrimental impact on the delays experienced through an SCTP association.  The throughput achievable over an SCTP association also is negatively impacted by the occurrence of T3-Retransmissions.  The present SCTP Fast Recovery algorithms as specified by [RFC4960] are not able to adequately or timely recover losses in certain situations, thus resorting to loss recovery by lengthy T3-Retransimissions or by non-timely activation of Fast Recovery.  In this document we specify a number of enhancements to the SCTP Loss Recovery algorithms which amends some of these deficiencies with a particular focus on Loss Recovery for drops in Traffic Tails.  The enhancements supplement the existing algorithms of [RFC4960] with proactive probing and timer driven activation of the Fast Retransmission algorithm as well as a number of enhancements of the Fast Retransmission algorithm in itself are specified.</t></abstract>
