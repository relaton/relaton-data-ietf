<abstract><t>The Pay It Proper Protocol (PIPP) is an application-level network protocol for inter-process communication over the Internet using batches of function calls.  PIPP is to replace the use of HTTP for inter-process communication over the Internet, e.g. between a browser and a web server, leaving HTTP the task of downloading resources.  A distinction is made between HTTP links to resources and PIPP application links.  PIPP allows as many applications as possible to communicate over the Internet.  This RFC defines the protocol and application links, explains how to use PIPP to develop applications, explains how to develop browsers for PIPP applications, and explains how to develop secure applications.</t></abstract>
