<abstract><t>If encryption is performed under a single key, there is a certain maximum threshold amount of data that can be safely encrypted.  This amount is called key lifetime.  This specification contains a description of a variety of methods to increase the lifetime of symmetric keys.  It provides external and internal re-keying mechanisms based on hash functions and on block ciphers that can be used with such modes of operations as CTR, GCM, CCM, CBC, CFB, OFB and OMAC.</t></abstract>
