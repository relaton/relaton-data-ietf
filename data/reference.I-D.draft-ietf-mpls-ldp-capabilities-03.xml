<abstract><t>A number of enhancements to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) have been proposed. Some have been implemented, and some are advancing toward standardization.  It is likely that additional enhancements will be proposed in the future.  At present, LDP has no mechanism for advertising such enhancements at LDP session initialization time.  There is also no mechanism to enable and disable enhancements after the session is established. This document defines a mechanism for advertising LDP enhancements at session initialization time, as well as a mechanism to enable and disable enhancements after LDP session establishment.</t></abstract>
