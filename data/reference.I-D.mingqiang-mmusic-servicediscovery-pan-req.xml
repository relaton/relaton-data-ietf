<abstract><t>Several protocols exist in the industry for device/service discovery. Each of these protocols addresses the aspects of device/service discovery in different network environments. A Service Discovery in a PAN Personal Area Network (PAN) is dynamic in its nature where devices may join and leave the network very frequently. A PAN, being an ad- hoc network, also differs from fixed networks in many other ways. The current generation of service protocols such as SLP were not designed for such an environment. This document specifies the requirements of a service discovery protocol for PANs, which specifically can be used for applications such as multimedia session transfer between devices within a PAN.</t></abstract>
