<abstract><t>Protection and recovery are important features of service offerings in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.  Increasingly, MPLS and GMPLS networks are being extended from single domain scope to multi-domain environments.</t><t>Various schemes and processes have been developed to establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in multi-domain environments.  These are discussed in RFC 4726: &quot;A Framework for Inter-Domain Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering&quot;.</t><t>This document analyzes the application of these techniques to protection and recovery in multi-domain networks.  The main focus for this document is on establishing end-to-end diverse Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs in multi-domain networks.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
