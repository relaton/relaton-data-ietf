<abstract><t>This document specifies a framework for using existing, modified and potential new networking technologies as components to provide an Enhanced Virtual Private Networks (VPN+) service.  The purpose is to enable VPNs to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services.  Typically, VPN+ can be used to form the underpinning of network slicing, but will also be of use in its own right.</t></abstract>
