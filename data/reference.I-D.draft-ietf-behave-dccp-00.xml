<abstract><t>This document defines a set of requirements for DCCP-capable NATs that would allow certain applications, such as streaming applications to operate consistently.  These requirements are very similar to the TCP requirements for NATs already published by this IETF working group.  Developing NATs that meet this set of requirements will greatly increase the likelihood that applications using DCCP will function properly.</t></abstract>
