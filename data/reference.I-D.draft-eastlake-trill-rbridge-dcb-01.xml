<abstract><t>IEEE 802.1 is developing standards as part of its Data Center Bridging (DCB) activity that amend the IEEE 802.1Q standard. These include 802.1Qau, 802.1Qaz, and 802.1Qbb. The intent of these three standards is (1) to efficiently minimize data loss due to queue overflow for selected classes of traffic within Local Area Networks (LANs) meeting certain conditions and (2) to provide means to allocate the available bandwidth on links to different classes of traffic.  IEEE 802.1 is specifying theses standards and the behavior needed to support them in bridges and end stations. This document briefly explains the standards and discusses the support of these standards in RBridges.</t></abstract>
