<abstract><t>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.  Instead, links with restricting Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation and reassembly (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below IPv6.  This latter category of links is often performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link adaptation.  This document therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better accommodate links that require link-specific adaptation to meet the IPv6 minimum MTU of 1280 bytes.</t></abstract>
