<abstract><t>The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group is charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich communication using audio, video, and data between two peers' web- browsers.  For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working group has in particular defined the concept of bi-directional data channels over SCTP, where each data channel might be used to transport other protocols, called sub-protocols.  This document specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) can be instantiated as a WebRTC data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP offer/exchange to negotiate out-of-band the sub-protocol specific parameters.  Two network configurations are documented: a WebRTC end- to-end configuration (connecting two MSRP over data channel endpoints), and a gateway configuration (connecting an MSRP over data channel endpoint with an MSRP over TCP endpoint).</t></abstract>
