<abstract><t>Consumers of IP network performance metrics have many different uses in mind.  This memo provides &quot;long-term&quot; reporting considerations (e.g., hours, days, weeks, or months, as opposed to 10 seconds), based on analysis of the points of view of two key audiences.  It describes how these audience categories affect the selection of metric parameters and options when seeking information that serves their needs.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
