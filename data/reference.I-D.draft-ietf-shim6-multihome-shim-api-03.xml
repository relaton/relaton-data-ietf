<abstract><t>This document specifies a socket API for the multihoming shim layer. The API aims to enable interactions between the applications and the multihoming shim layer for advanced locator management and access to information about failure detection and path exploration. This document is based on an assumption that a multihomed host is equipped with a conceptual sublayer (here after "shim") inside the IP layer that maintains mappings between identifiers and locators. Examples of the shim are SHIM6 and HIP.</t></abstract>
