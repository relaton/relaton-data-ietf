<abstract><t>The NewSessionTicket record carries a field that tells a client the volume of early data that it can include in the 0-RTT messages when reconnecting to the same peer.  There are cases where additional information can significantly improve the time-to-service.  This memo discusses a solution where path adaptation parameters are also shared between the peers.  There are use cases where this can accelerate the throughput of subsequent 0-RTT connections in both direction.</t></abstract>
