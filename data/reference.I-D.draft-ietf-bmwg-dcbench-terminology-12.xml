<abstract><t>The purpose of this informational document is to establish definitions and describe measurement techniques for data center benchmarking, as well as it is to introduce new terminologies applicable to data center performance evaluations. The purpose of this document is not to define the test methodology, but rather establish the important concepts for benchmarking network switches and routers in the data center. The terminologies are not only data center specific and can be seen as updates to [RFC1242], [RFC2432], [RFC2544], [RFC2889] and [RFC3918], without the intent to cover the all use cases outside of data center.</t></abstract>
