<abstract><t>This document describes a profile for AS Adjacency Attestation Objects (AAOs).  An AAO is a digitally signed object that provides a means of verifying that an AS holder has made an attestation that it has a inter-domain routing adjacency with one or more other AS's, with the associated inference that this AS is prepared to announce or receive routes with these adjacent AS's in the inter-domain domain environment.</t></abstract>
