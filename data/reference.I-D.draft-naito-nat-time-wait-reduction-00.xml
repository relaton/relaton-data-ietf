<abstract><t>When network address translation (NAT) is used in an address resource restricted environment, or when a lot of users are located under a NAT device, IP addresses and port resources may be eaten up, and this affects user experiences very negatively.  This situation can be greatly mitigated by tweaking mapping behavior and session timer handling in NAT functions.  This document proposes extension for optimizing NAT IP address and port resources in address resource restricted environments.  The extension makes use of TCP timestamps and sequence numbers for TIME_WAIT assassination.</t></abstract>
