<abstract><t>There are several problems that arise in the standard Registrant/Registrar/Registry model when the operator of a zone is neither the Registrant nor the Registrar for the delegation. Historically the issues have been minor, and limited to difficulty guiding the Registrant through the initial changes to the NS records for the delegation.  As this is usually a one time activity when the operator first takes charge of the zone it has not been treated as a serious issue.  When the domain hand uses DNSSEC it necessary to make regular (sometimes annual) changes to the delegation, updating DS record(s) in order to track KSK rollover.  Under the current model this is prone to delays and errors, as the Registrant must participate in updates to DS records.  This document describes a simple protocol that allows a third party DNS operator to update DS and NS records for a delegation, in a trusted manner, without involving the Registrant for each operation. This same protocol can be used by Registrants.</t></abstract>
