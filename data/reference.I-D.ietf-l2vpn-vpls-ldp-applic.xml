<abstract><t>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a layer 2 VPN service that provides multipoint connectivity in the form of an Ethernet emulated LAN, while usual L2 VPN services are typically point-to-point. Such emulated LANs can span across metropolitan area networks as well as wide area networks. [VPLS-LDP] defines a method for signaling MPLS connections between member PEs of a VPN and a method for forwarding Ethernet frames over such connections. This document describes the applicability of such procedures to provide VPLS services. This document also compares the characteristics of this solution against the requirements specified in [L2VPN-REQ]. In summary, there are no architectural limitations to prevent the requirements from being met. But meeting certain requirements (e.g. QoS) is beyond the specification of [VPLS-LDP], and requires careful planning and precise implementation of the Service Provider (SP) networks. This document attempts to capture such issues, presents the potential solutions to these issues, and discusses the pros and cons of each alternative. This document does not cover the applicability of [VPLS-BGP].</t></abstract>
