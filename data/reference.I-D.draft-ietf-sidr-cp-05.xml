<abstract><t>This document describes the certificate policy for a PKI used to support applications that make use of attestations about Internet resource holdings. The principle application that motivated creation of this PKI is routing security, but other applications that rely on such attestations also may make use of this PKI, e.g., resource transfer. Each organization that allocates IP addresses or Autonomous System (AS) numbers to an organization will, in parallel, issue a certificate reflecting this allocation. These certificates  will enable verification that the holder of the associated private key has been allocated the resources indicated in the certificate, and is the current, unique holder of these resources. The PKI in which the certificates issued under this policy are employed, in conjunction with ancillary digitally signed data structures, will provide critical inputs for routing security mechanisms.</t></abstract>
