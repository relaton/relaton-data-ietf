<abstract><t>This document describes a framework for the transmission of IP datagrams over DVB-S2, the second generation standard for Digital Video Broadcasting over Satellite. The new standard features an improved and adaptive physical layer, as well as a new framing structure at link level, the Generic Streams. Combined use of adaptability and Generic Streams is expected to offer throughputs never achieved for IP services up to now, but no standard way to carry IP data using the specific features of DVB-S2 has been defined yet. The present document analyzes these issues, and it identifies the requirements for the definition of a standard interface between the DVB-S2 link layer and an IP subnetwork.</t></abstract>
