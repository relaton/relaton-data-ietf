<abstract><t>The IETF cannot ordain what standards or protocols are to be used on networks, but the standards development process in the IETF has a normative effect.  Among other things, the IETF's work affects what is perceived as technologically possible and useful where networking technologies are being deployed, and its standards reflect what is considered by the technical community to be feasible and good practice.  Because the IETF's protocols mediate many aspects of modern life, and therefore contribute to the ordering of societies and communities, the consideration of the potential social impact of protocols should be part of the standardization and development process.</t></abstract>
