<abstract><t>This memo proposes a way of transporting NETCONF over WebSocket protocol.  Web-related technologies are advancing and number of Web- based systems are increasing.  Management systems that adopt Web- related technologies or that have browser-based management interface are getting common.  It is natural to expect that there is a standard network operation and management protocol to be used over HTTP. Currently, however, there are few efforts in this area.  Although NETCONF[RFC6241] once defined itself to be sent over SOAP/ HTTPS[RFC4743], supposedly due to unfamiliarity to SOAP or lack of bi-directional capability, such efforts aren't successful enough[I-D.ietf-netconf-rfc4743-rfc4744-to-historic].  But now, WebSocket protocol, the update of HTTP equipped with bi-directional capability, is available[RFC6455].  This memo describes how NETCONF should be treated over WebSocket protocol.</t></abstract>
