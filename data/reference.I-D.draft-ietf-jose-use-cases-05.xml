<abstract><t>Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security mechanisms in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or transport layer.  In the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) has provided a binary secure object format based on ASN.1.  Over time, the use of binary object encodings such as ASN.1 has been overtaken by text-based encodings, for example JavaScript Object Notation.  This document defines a set of use cases and requirements for a secure object format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), drawn from a variety of application security mechanisms currently in development.</t></abstract>
