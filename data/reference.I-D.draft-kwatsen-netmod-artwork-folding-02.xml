<abstract><t>This document introduces a simple and yet time-proven strategy for handling long lines in artwork in drafts using a backslash ('\') character where line-folding has occurred.  The strategy works on any text based artwork, producing consistent results regardless the artwork content.  Using a per-artwork notice, the strategy is both self-documenting and enables automated reconstitution of the original artwork.</t></abstract>
