<abstract><t>RFC3530 described an fs_locations attribute which can be used to allow an fs to migrate between servers without disrupting client access and to refer a client to another server providing access to a specified file system. Initial implementation work for this feature has exposed a number of areas where RFC3530's handling of the issues leaves something to be desired. This document makes a number of suggestions to remedy these issues when the NFSv4 spec next undergoes a significant revision, most likely in connection with implementing a new minor revision, such as NFSv4.1.</t></abstract>
