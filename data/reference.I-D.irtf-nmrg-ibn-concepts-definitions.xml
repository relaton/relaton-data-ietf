<abstract><t>Intent and Intent-Based Networking (IBN) are taking the industry by storm.  At the same time, IBN-related terms are often used loosely and inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and confused with other concepts such as &quot;Policy.&quot;  This document clarifies the concept of &quot;Intent&quot; and provides an overview of the functionality that is associated with it.  The goal is to contribute towards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that can be used as the foundation to guide further definition of associated research and engineering problems and their solutions.</t><t> This document is a product of the IRTF Network Management Research Group (NMRG).  It reflects the consensus of the RG, receiving reviews from 8 members and explicit support from 14 (beyond the authors).  It is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
