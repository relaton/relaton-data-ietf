<abstract><t>This document provides the final clarification of the conclusions resulting in the expansion of 'RFC 1518 and 1519', which redefines the 'CIDR' notation as the 'Network Descriptor', and proves that the IP Address Pool of the IPtX Specification is greater than IPv6. And more importantly, because these conclusions reveal the actual design of the Binary Communication System, the Revolutionary impact sustained, is an upheavel affecting the entire field of Computer Science. In other words, IPtX is a more powerful and cost effective IP Addressing Specification that when using the 'IPtX-MX Routing Protocol' {'2"X : 1' Compression Ratio}, the interface of the "Front-End" can mimic or simulate a 32 Bit-Mapped IP Address. And this, in conjunction with the IPtX Overlay, provides a 100% Backward Compatibility with the IPv4 Specification, in the Backbone environment approaching an unlimited size 'Bit-Map' Address Space.</t></abstract>
