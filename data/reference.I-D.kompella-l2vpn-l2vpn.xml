<abstract><t>Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs) based on Frame Relay or ATM circuits have been around a long time; more recently, Ethernet VPNs, including Virtual Private LAN Service, have become popular. Traditional L2VPNs often required a separate Service Provider infrastructure for each type, and yet another for the Internet and IP VPNs.  In addition, L2VPN provisioning was cumbersome.  This document presents a new approach to the problem of offering L2VPN services where the L2VPN customer's experience is virtually identical to that offered by traditional Layer 2 VPNs, but such that a Service Provider can maintain a single network for L2VPNs, IP VPNs and the Internet, as well as a common provisioning methodology for all services.</t></abstract>
