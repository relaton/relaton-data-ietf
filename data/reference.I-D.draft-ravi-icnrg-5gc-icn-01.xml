<abstract><t>The proposed 3GPP's 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) offers flexibility to introduce new user and control plane function, considering the support for network slicing functions, that allows greater flexibility to handle heterogeneous devices and applications. In this draft, we provide a short description of the proposed 5GC architecture, followed by extensions to 5GC's control and user plane to support packet data unit (PDU) sessions from information-centric networks.  The value of enabling ICN in 5GC is discussed using multiple service scenarios in the context of mobile edge computing such as smart mobility and VR use case, and to enable network services such as seamless mobility for ICN sessions.</t></abstract>
