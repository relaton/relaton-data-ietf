<abstract><t>Often an intermediate instance (such as a proxy server) is used to connect to a web server or a communicating peer if a direct end-to- end IP connectivity is not possible or the proxy can provide a support service like, e.g., address anonymisation.  To use a non- transparent proxy a client explicitly connects to it and requests forwarding to the final target server.  The client either knows the proxy address as preconfigured in the application or can dynamically learn about available proxy services.  This document describes different discovery mechanisms for non-transparent proxies that are either located in the local network, e.g. home or enterprise network, in the access network, or somewhere else on the Internet usually close to the target server or even in the same network as the target server.  This document assumes that the non-transparent proxy server is connected via QUIC and discusses potential discovery mechanisms for such a QUIC-based, non-transparent proxy.</t></abstract>
