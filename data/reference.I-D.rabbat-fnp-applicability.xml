<abstract><t>The Fault Notification Protocol (FNP) is a set of procedures designed to enable time-bounded failure notification in networks using an IP- based control plane. This document discusses the applicability of FNP in the context of optical transport networks. It highlights the protocol?s principles of operation, and then describes the network, node, fault, and operational models in optical networks for which the protocol is designed. It also discusses the relationship to higher layers, and issues of scalability. Some guidelines for deployment are also provided.</t></abstract>
