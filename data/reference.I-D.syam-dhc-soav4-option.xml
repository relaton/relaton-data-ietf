<abstract><t>This document introduces a new option in DHCPv4 for Service-Oriented Address assignment for a particular type of service that DHCPv4 Clients provide. The Service-Oriented Address can be either Anycast/Shared Unicast or a Well-known Unicast Addresses. This address assignment is much similar to other address type assignments, except that Service-Oriented Address assignment requires the specification of Service Type of the node that is requesting the address.</t></abstract>
