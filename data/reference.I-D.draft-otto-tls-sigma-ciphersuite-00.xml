<abstract><t>This document describes a TLS ciphersuite which is based on the SIGMA protocol. By its careful adoption in the TLS handshake protocol, the proposed ciphersuite is able to inherit features of the SIGMA protocol. The ciphersuite provides active identity protection, forward secrecy, deniability and adjustable security strength. A similar ciphersuite offering these features has not yet been proposed so far.</t></abstract>
