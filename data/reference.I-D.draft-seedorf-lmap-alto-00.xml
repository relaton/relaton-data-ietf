<abstract><t>In the context of Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP), measurment results are currently made available to the public either at the finest granularity level (e.g. as a list of results of all individual tests), or in a very high level human-readable format (e.g. as PDF reports).  This document argues that there is a need for an intermediate way to provide access to large-scale network measurement results, flexible enough to enable querying of specific and possibly aggregated data. The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol, defined with the goal to provide applications with network information, seems a good candidate to fulfill such a role.</t></abstract>
