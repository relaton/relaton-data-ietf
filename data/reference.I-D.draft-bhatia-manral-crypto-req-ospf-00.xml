<abstract><t>OSPF defines three different kinds of authentication schemes: Null authentication, simple password and cryptographic authentication. The cryptographic authentication scheme can make use of various cryptographic algorithms in order to authenticate the OSPF packets. To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is necessary to specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have available. This document defines the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to be used for the cryptographic authentication for OSPF as well as specifying the algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time.</t></abstract>
