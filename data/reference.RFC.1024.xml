<abstract><t>This memo assigns instruction codes, defines object formats and object semantics for use with the High-Level Monitoring and Control Language, defined in RFC-1023.  A general system has been described in previous memos (RFC-1021, RFC-1022).  This system is called the High-Level Entity Management System (HEMS).  This memo is provisional and the definitions are subject to change.  Readers should confirm with the authors that they have the most recent version.  This RFC assumes a working knowledge of the ISO data encoding standard, ASN.1, and a general understanding of the IP protocol suite.</t></abstract>
