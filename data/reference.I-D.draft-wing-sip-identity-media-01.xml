<abstract><t>The existing SIP identity mechanism (RFC4474) creates a signature over the SIP body, including the entire SDP.  As part of their normal operation, Session Border Controllers (SBCs) and SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) modify various fields in the SDP which breaks that signature.  This document defines a new identity mechanism which operates with SBCs and B2BUAs.  This new identity mechanism creates a signature over certain SIP headers and certain SDP lines, and uses both SIP signaling and the media path to perform its identity function.</t></abstract>
