<abstract><t>This document explains a few use cases where operators would like to introduce so-called "walled gardens" into home-networks, including distribution of new DNS anchors.  This document proposes an alternative solution involving DNS delegations to access controlled DNS servers.  The results are much more scalable, and can be deployed today, using existing operating systems and existing DNS infrastructure.</t></abstract>
