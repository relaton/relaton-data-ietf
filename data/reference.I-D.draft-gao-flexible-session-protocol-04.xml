<abstract><t>FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that provides mobility and multihoming support by introducing the concept of 'upper layer thread ID', which is associated with some shared secret that is applied with some secure hash or authenticated encryption algorithm to protect authenticity of the origin of the FSP packets.  It is able to provide following services to the upper layer application:  o  Stream-oriented send-receive with native message boundary  support   o  Ubiquitous authenticated encryption o  0-RTT multiplication of connections o  On-the-wire compression</t></abstract>
