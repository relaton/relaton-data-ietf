<abstract><t>Parameters that define the expected quality of location information are defined for use in location protocols.  These parameter can be used by a requester to indicate to a Location Server the desired constraints on the quality of the location information provided.  If applicable, the Location Server is able to use this information to control how location information is determined.  An optional indication of whether the quality constraints were met is defined to be provided by the Location Server alongside location information.</t></abstract>
