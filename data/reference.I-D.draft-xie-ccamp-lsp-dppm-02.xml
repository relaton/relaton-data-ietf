<abstract><t>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is one of the most promising candidate technologies for the future data transmission network.  The GMPLS has been developed to control and cooperate different kinds of network elements, such as conventional routers, switches, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) systems, Add- Drop Multiplexors (ADMs), photonic cross-connects (PXCs), optical cross-connects (OXCs), etc.  Dynamic provisioning ability of these physically diverse devices differs from each other drastically.  At the same time, the need for dynamically provisioned connections is increasing because optical networks are being deployed in metro area. As different applications have varied requirements in the provisioning performance of optical networks, it is imperative to define standardized metrics and procedures such that the performance of networks and application needs can be mapped to each other.  This document provides a series of performance metrics to evaluate the dynamic LSP provisioning performance in GMPLS networks, specifically the dynamical LSP setup/release performance.  These metrics can depict the features of the GMPLS network in LSP dynamic provisioning.  They can also be used in operational networks for carriers to monitor the control plane performance in realtime.</t></abstract>
