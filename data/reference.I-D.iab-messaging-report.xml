<abstract><t>This document reports the outcome of a workshop held by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) on the future of Internet messaging. The workshop was held on 6 and 7 October 2004 in Burlingame, CA, USA. The goal of the workshop was to examine the current state of different messaging technologies on the Internet (including, but not limited to, electronic mail, instant messaging, and voice messaging), look at their commonalities and differences, and find engineering, research, and architectural topics on which future work could be done. This report summarizes the discussions and conclusions of the workshop and of the IAB.</t></abstract>
