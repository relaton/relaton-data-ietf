<abstract><t>This document defines a new control bit in the IPv6 RA PIO flags octet that indicates that the node receiving this RA is the exclusive receiver of all traffic destined to any address within that prefix.  Termed the eXclusive bit (or "X bit"), nodes that recognize this can perform some traffic-saving optimizations (e.g. disable ND and DAD for addresses within this prefix) and more immediately pursue the benefits of being provided multiple addresses (vis.  [RFC7934] section 3).  Additionally, network infrastructure nodes (routers, switches) can benefit by minimizing the number of {link layer, IP} address pairs required to offer network connectivity (vis.  [RFC7934] section 9.3).  Use of the X bit is backward compatible with existing IPv6 standards compliant implementations.</t></abstract>
