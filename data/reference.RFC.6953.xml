<abstract><t>Portions of the radio spectrum that are assigned to a particular use but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as &quot;white space&quot;.  The concept of allowing additional transmissions (which may or may not be licensed) in white space is a technique to &quot;unlock&quot; existing spectrum for new use.  This document includes the problem statement for the development of a protocol to access a database of white-space information followed by use cases and requirements for that protocol.  Finally, requirements associated with the protocol are presented.</t></abstract>
