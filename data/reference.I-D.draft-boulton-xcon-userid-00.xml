The conference user concept is introduced in the framework to identify the entity participating in a conference and manipulating conferencing system related properties. This document defines a Conference User Identifier and syntax for identifying a specific conference user within a conferencing system. The document also describes the logical mapping of this conference user identifier to protocol and signaling interface specific user identifiers.</t></abstract>
