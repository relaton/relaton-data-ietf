<abstract><t>This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation functionality for very low bandwidth networks.  These techniques are specially tailored for Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).  The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) offers a great level of flexibility when processing the header fields.  SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored in a LPWAN device and in the network.  Static context means that the stored information does not change during packet transmission.  The context describes the field values and keeps information that will not be transmitted through the constrained network.  SCHC must be used for LPWAN networks because it avoids complex resynchronization mechanisms, which are incompatible with LPWAN characteristics.  And also, because with SCHC, in most cases IPv6/UDP headers can be reduced to a small identifier called Rule ID.  Even though, sometimes, a SCHC compressed packet will not fit in one L2 PDU, and the SCHC fragmentation protocol defined in this document may be used.  This document describes the SCHC compression/decompression framework and applies it to IPv6/UDP headers.  This document also specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism that is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over LPWAN technologies.  Fragmentation is mandatory for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when it has not been possible to apply such compression, still exceed the L2 maximum payload size.  Similar solutions for other protocols such as CoAP will be described in separate documents.</t></abstract>
