<abstract><t>An important class of location-based services answers the question, &quot;What instances of this service are closest to me?&quot;  Examples include finding restaurants, gas stations, stores, automated teller machines, wireless access points (hot spots), or parking spaces.  Currently, the Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol only supports mapping locations to a single service based on service regions.

This document defines  an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
