<abstract><t>This document recommends a mechanism for limiting the number of concurrent branches pursued for any given request. This is intended to reduce the damage caused by amplification attacks. The purpose of this document is to stimulate discussion of the identified problem and proposed solution. Some of the proposed solution language appears normative, but implementors should not treat the current document as such. Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the SIPPING working group list at 'sipping@ietf.org'.</t></abstract>
