<abstract><t>This is a personal view of what the IETF community might expect of its members who serve in leadership positions such as Area Directors and IAB members.  It is intended as personal input to the Nominating Committee, but posted as a draft since there is nothing private about it.  A particular emphasis is placed on the need for such members to be responsive to the community as a whole rather than to impose personal opinions.</t></abstract>
