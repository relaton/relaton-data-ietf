<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 for Dual Stack Hosts and Routers enables mobility for the mobile node's IPv6 home address or prefix as well as an IPv4 home address, irrespective of the IP version supported on the link that the mobile node is attached to.  The home agent maintains binding cache entries for the IPv6 and IPv4 home addresses assigned to the mobile node when the mobile node is connected via a foreign link. The binding cache entries are deprecated when the mobile node attaches to its home link.  This document addresses an issue related to the de-registration procedure and the continued connectivity for the IPv4 home address when the mobile node attaches to its IPv6-only home link.</t></abstract>
