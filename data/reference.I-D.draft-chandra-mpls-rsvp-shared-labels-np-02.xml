<abstract><t>Segment Routed RSVP-TE tunnels provide the ability to use a shared MPLS forwarding plane at every hop of the Label Switched Path (LSP). The shared forwarding plane is realized with the use of 'Traffic Engineering (TE) link labels' that get shared by LSPs traversing these TE links.  This paradigm helps significantly reduce the forwarding plane state required to support a large number of LSPs on a Label Switching Router (LSR).  These tunnels require the ingress Label Edge Router (LER) to impose a stack of labels.  If the ingress LER cannot impose the full label stack, it can use the assistance of one or more delegation hops along the path of the LSP to impose parts of the label stack.  The procedures for a Point of Local Repair (PLR) to provide local protection against link failures using facility backup for Segment Routed RSVP-TE tunnels are well defined and do not require specific protocol extensions.  This document defines the procedures for a PLR to provide local protection against transit node failures using facility backup for these tunnels.  The procedures defined in this document include protection against delegation hop failures.</t></abstract>
