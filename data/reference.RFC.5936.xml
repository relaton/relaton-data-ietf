<abstract><t>The standard means within the Domain Name System protocol for maintaining coherence among a zone's authoritative name servers consists of three mechanisms.  Authoritative Transfer (AXFR) is one of the mechanisms and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035.</t><t>The definition of AXFR has proven insufficient in detail, thereby forcing implementations intended to be compliant to make assumptions, impeding interoperability.  Yet today we have a satisfactory set of implementations that do interoperate.  This document is a new definition of AXFR -- new in the sense that it records an accurate definition of an interoperable AXFR mechanism.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
