  <abstract><t>The protocol and compatible interconnection for data communication devices using low data-rate, low-power, and low-complexity short-range radio frequency (RF) transmissions in a wire less personal area network (WPAN) were defined in IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006. In this revision, the market applicability of IEEE Std 802.15.4 is extended, the ambiguities in the standard are removed, and the improvements learned from implementations of IEEE Std 802.15.4-2006 are included.</t>
