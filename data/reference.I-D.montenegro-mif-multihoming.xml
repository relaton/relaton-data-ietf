<abstract><t>Increasingly, hosts have more than one network interface active at any given point in time. Such multiplicity of interfaces leads to multiple and potentially conflicting (or overlapping) sets of configuration information and policies. How these are arbitrated and managed influence how the host resolves DNS queries, and-with respect to outgoing packets-how it selects a source address and an outgoing interface.</t></abstract>
