<abstract><t>The time required to detect movement between networks, and to obtain (or continue to use) an IPv4 configuration may be significant as a fraction of the total handover latency in moving between points of attachment. This document synthesizes from experience in the deployment of hosts supporting ARP, DHCP, and IPv4 Link-Local addresses a set of steps known as Detecting Network Attachment for IPv4 (DNAv4), in order to decrease the handover latency in moving between points of attachment.</t></abstract>
