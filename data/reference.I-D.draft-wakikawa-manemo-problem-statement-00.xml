<abstract><t>This document outlines the fundamental problems and approach rationale of MANEMO. When mobile nodes converge at the edge of the Internet using wireless interfaces, they can form a network in an ad- hoc fashion and are able to provide Internet connectivity to one another. This type of network is called a MANEMO Fringe Stub (MFS). Several issues exist in the MFS such as network loop, un-optimized path and multiple exit routers to the Internet. While fixed routers provide connectivity constantly, mobile routers can experience intermittent connectivity to the Internet due to their movement. When NEMO Basic Support is used in this context, network loops naturally occur. NEMO forces the packets to always travel through the home agent, which in turn causes an un-optimized path that can become a considerable problem when mobile routers form a nested topology. Multicast support introduces emphasized inefficiency. Different types of routers are able to provide Internet connectivity in the MFS, including both mobile routers and fixed access routers. Any node requiring Internet connectivity has to select the best exit router toward the Internet, therefore it is necessary for mobile nodes to maintain a local topology in the MFS and to utilise any available connectivity with a degree of Intelligence.</t></abstract>
