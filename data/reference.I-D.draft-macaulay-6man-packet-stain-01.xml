<abstract><t>This document specifies the application of security staining on an IPv6 datagrams and the minimum requirements for IPv6 nodes staining flows, IPv6 nodes forwarding stained packets within a given domain of control, and nodes interpreting stains on flows.  The usage of the packet staining destination option enables proactive delivery of security intelligence to IPv6 nodes such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems, and end-points such servers, workstations, mobile and smart devices and an infinite array of as- yet-to-be-invented sensors and controllers.  The usage of packet staining is not intended for use across the open internet, where fragmentation issues associated with increased header size may induce service degradation; packet staining is intended as a security adjunct within a given doamin of control such as an carrier or enterprise network.</t></abstract>
