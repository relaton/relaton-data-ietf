<abstract><t>The purpose of this document defines a general multicast YANG service model.  This document intent to provide a general and all-round multicast service model, and guides the deployment of multicast technology.  This model includes many of the existed multicast technology.  But this document does not define any specifically and detailed YANG model of multicast protocol.  The multicast model can be used with YANG models of specifically multicast technologies, such as PIM, MLD, and BIER and so on.  This document proposes a general and all-round multicast service YANG model, which provides explanations and guidelines for the deployment of multicast service in all kinds of multicast scenarios.  The multicast technologies include BIER multicast, PIM multicast, MPLS multicast and so on.  And also, there defines several possible RPCs about how to interact between multicast service model and multicast device model.</t></abstract>
