<abstract><t>Network Coding is a technique used to code packets and be able to recover coded packets from loses.  It requires at least two participating nodes in the path of the packet, one to encode and another to decode.  This document discusses the impact of virtualization and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) on the emerging network coding.  This document also discusses the integration of network coding in various layers of the network stack and the APIs required from the network coding entity to program it from a controller.</t></abstract>
