<abstract><t>This draft describes the concept of the SRLG-based logical ring configuration and recovery method using the ring-SRLG for the purpose of restoration in mesh networks. In this restoration architecture, backup paths can be easily established through the end-to-end path, which follows the logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment of backup path disjointed from the working path. We also propose the GMPLS signaling extension for the end-to-end restoration based on the SRLG-based logical ring configuration.</t></abstract>
