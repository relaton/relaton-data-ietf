<abstract><t>The specification for how a client discovers its network's NAT64 prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this purpose, but declares it to be a non-special name in that specification's Domain Name Reservation Considerations section.  Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of the name, (at the time of writing) 'ipv4only.arpa' still does not appear as one of the names with special properties recorded in the Special- Use Domain Names registry.  As a result of this omission, in cases where software needs to give this name special treatment in order for it to work correctly, there is no clear mandate authorizing software authors to implement that special treatment.  Software implementers are left with the choice between not implementing the special behavior necessary for the name queries to work correctly, or implementing the special behavior and being accused of being noncompliant with some RFC.  This document formally declares the actual special properties of the name, and adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse mapping names.</t></abstract>
