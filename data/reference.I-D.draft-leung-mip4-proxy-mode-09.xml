<abstract><t>Mobile IPv4 is a standard mobility protocol that enables IPv4 device to move among networks while maintaining its IP address.  The mobile device has the Mobile IPv4 client function to signal its location to the routing anchor, known as the Home Agent.  However, there are many IPv4 devices without such capability due to various reasons.  This document describes Proxy Mobile IPv4 (PMIPv4), a scheme based on having the Mobile IPv4 client function in a network entity to provide mobility support for an unaltered and mobility-unaware IPv4 device. This document also describes a particular application of PMIPv4 as specified in the WiMAX Forum and another application that is to be adopted in 3GPP2.</t></abstract>
