<abstract><t>This draft presents an NSIS operation over IP tunnel scheme using QoS NSLP as the NSIS signaling application.  Both sender-initiated and receiver-initiated NSIS signaling modes are discussed.  The scheme creates individual or aggregate tunnel sessions for end-to-end sessions traversing the tunnel.  Packets belonging to qualified end- to-end sessions are mapped to corresponding tunnel sessions and assigned special flow IDs to be distinguished from the rest of the tunnel traffic.  Tunnel endpoints keep the association of the end-to- end and tunnel session mapping, so that adjustment in one session can be reflected in the other.</t></abstract>
