<abstract><t>There is a class of data serving protocols and applications that cannot tolerate undetected data corruption on the wire.  Data corruption could occur at the source in software, in the network interface card, out on the link, on intermediate routers or at the destination network interface card or node.  The Ethernet CRC and the 16-bit checksum in the TCP/UDP headers are used to detect data errors.  Most applications rely on these checksums to detect data corruptions and do not use any checksums or CRC checks at their level.  Research has shown that the TCP/UDP checksums are catching a significant number of errors, however, the research suggests that one packet in 10 billion will have an error that goes undetected for Ethernet MTU frames (MTU of 1500).  Under certain situations, "bad" hosts can introduce undetected errors at a much higher frequency and order.  With the use of Jumbo frames on the rise, and therefore more data bits on the wire that could be corrupted, the current 16-bit TCP/UDP checksum, or the Ethernet 32-bit CRC are simply not sufficient for detecting errors.  This document specifies a proposal to use stronger checksum algorithms for TCP Jumbo Frames for IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  The Castagnoli CRC 32C algorithm used in iSCSI and SCTP is proposed as the error detection code of choice.</t></abstract>
