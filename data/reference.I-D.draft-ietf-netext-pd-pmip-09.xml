<abstract><t>This specification defines extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol for allowing a mobile router in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain to obtain delegated IP prefixes for its attached mobile networks.  The mobility entities in the network will provide network-based mobility management support for those delegated IP prefixes just as how IP mobility support is provided for the mobile node's home address. Even as the mobile router performs a handoff and changes its network point of attachment, mobility support is ensured for all the delegated IP prefixes and for all the IP nodes in the mobile network that use IP address configuration from those delegated IP prefixes.</t></abstract>
