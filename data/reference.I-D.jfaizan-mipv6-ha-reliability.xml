<abstract><t>In Mobile-IPv6, Mobile Node is dependent on a single Home Agent for the seamless roaming over the Internet. Mobile-IPv6 also allows deployment of multiple Home Agents on the subnet for providing continuous service to Mobile Node in case of serving Home Agent failure. But switching of service from the failed Home Agent to another functional Home Agent on the Home Subnet is problematic and the base Mobile-IPv6 specifications does not currently have well-described solutions. This document aims to describe and illustrate these problems, and propose some guidelines for possible solutions.</t></abstract>
