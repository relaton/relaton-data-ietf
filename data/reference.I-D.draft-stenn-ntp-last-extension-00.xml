<abstract><t>NTPv4 is defined by RFC 5905 [RFC5905], and it and earlier versions of the NTP Protocol have supported symmetric private key MAC authentication.  MACs pre-date the Extension Fields introduced in RFC 5905 [RFC5905], and as the number of Extension Fields grows there is an increasing chance of ambiguity when deciding if the "next" set of data is an Extension Field or a MAC.  This proposal defines a new Extension Field which is used to signifiy that it is the last Extension Field in the packet.  If present, any subsequent data SHOULD be considered to be a legacy MAC.</t></abstract>
