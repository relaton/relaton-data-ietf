<abstract><t>Although the SIP History-Info header field described in RFC 7044 is the solution adopted in IETF, the non-standard Diversion header field described, as Historic, in RFC 5806 is nevertheless already implemented and used for conveying call-diversion-related information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling.</t><t>RFC 7044 obsoletes the original RFC 4244 and redefines the History-Info header field for capturing the history information in requests.</t><t>Since the Diversion header field is used in existing network implementations for the transport of call diversion information, its interworking with the SIP History-Info standardized solution is needed.  This document describes a recommended interworking guideline between the Diversion header field and the History-Info header field to handle call diversion information.  This work is intended to enable the migration from non-standard implementations toward IETF specification-based implementations.</t><t>This document obsoletes RFC 6044, which describes the interworking between the Diversion header field defined in RFC 5806 and the obsoleted History-Info header field defined on RFC 4244.</t></abstract>
