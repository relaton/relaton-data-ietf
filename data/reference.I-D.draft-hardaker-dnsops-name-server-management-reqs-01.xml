<abstract><t>Management of name servers for the Domain Name Service (DNS) has traditionally been done using vendor-specific monitoring, configuration and control methods.  Although some service monitoring platforms can test the functionality of the DNS itself, there has not been a interoperable way to control, configure and examine the internal performance of a given DNS server.  This document discusses the requirements of a management system for DNS name servers.  A management solution that is designed to manage the DNS should meet the needs discussed in this document.</t></abstract>
