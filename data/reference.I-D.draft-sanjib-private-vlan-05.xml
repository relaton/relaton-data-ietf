<abstract><t>This document describes the concept of Layer 2 isolation among devices that are members of the same Layer 2 domain. A vlan is a broadcast domain in which all devices can establish direct communication with one another at Layer 2. As a consequence, devices that are connected to the same vlan have an implicit trust relationship with each other. If 'untrusted' devices are introduced into a vlan, security issues may arise because trusted and untrusted devices end up sharing the same broadcast domain. The traditional solution to this kind of problem is to assign a separate vlan to each device that is concerned about Layer 2 security issues. That however is not a scalable solution. The mechanism proposed in this document can offer total Layer 2 isolation between devices connected to the same vlan. What that means is that, on the one hand, each customer will enjoy the benefits that come with a separate dedicated vlan, while on the other hand the service provider will enjoy the benefit of consuming as few as two vlan identifiers.</t></abstract>
