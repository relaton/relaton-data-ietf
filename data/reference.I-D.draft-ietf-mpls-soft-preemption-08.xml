<abstract><t>This document details MPLS Traffic Engineering Soft Preemption, a suite of protocol modifications extending the concept of preemption with the goal of reducing/eliminating traffic disruption of preempted Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs). Initially MPLS RSVP-TE was defined supporting only immediate TE LSP displacement upon preemption. The utilization of a preemption pending flag helps more gracefully mitigate the re-route process of preempted TE LSP. For the brief period soft preemption is activated, reservations (though not necessarily traffic levels) are in effect under- provisioned until the TE LSP(s) can be re-routed. For this reason, the feature is primarily but not exclusively interesting in MPLS enabled IP networks with Differentiated Services and Traffic Engineering capabilities.</t></abstract>
