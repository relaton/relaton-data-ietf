<abstract><t>This document proposes an extension to RELOAD to support direct response and relay peer routing modes.  The document starts with the problem statement and addresses concerns about these two routing modes mentioned in RELOAD.  Then methods about how to detect whether a node is publicly reachable in P2PSIP situations are discussed.  The last part proposes extensions to RELOAD for supporting these additional routing modes.</t></abstract>
