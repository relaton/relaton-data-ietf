<abstract><t>The document enumerates methods of port assignment in CGN contexts, more focusing on a NAT64 environment.  The analysis categorizes the different methods with several key features.  The uses of existing protocols are further described corresponding to those features. This memo also states the port-usage experiences, relevant findings, evaluations and workarounds.  It's expected the document could provide an informative base line to help operators choosing a proper method.</t></abstract>
