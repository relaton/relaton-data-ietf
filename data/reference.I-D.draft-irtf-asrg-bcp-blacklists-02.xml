<abstract><t>The rise of spam and other anti-social behavior on the Internet has led to the creation of shared DNS-based lists of IPs or domains used to help guide email filtering.  This memo discusses guidelines for management of public DNSBLs by the operators of such DNSBLs, as well as provide useful background for server administrators who use DNSBLs.  It is not intended to advise on the utility or effiacacy of particular DNSBLs or the DNSBL concept in general, nor to assist end users with questions about spam.  The document will seek BCP status.  Comments and discussion of this document should be addressed to the asrg@ietf.org mailing list.</t></abstract>
