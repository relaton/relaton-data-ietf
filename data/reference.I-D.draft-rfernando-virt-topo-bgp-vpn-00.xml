<abstract><t>This document presents techniques that build on MPLS/VPN control plane mechanisms to construct virtual service topologies in data centers. These virtual service topologies interconnect network zones and help to constrain the flow of traffic that go between zones so that interesting services can be applied to them.  The techniques suggested are required to create a rich overlay network that mimics topology and routing functions of physical networks. Steps to create a virtual service topology and the ability to constrain routing and traffic to flow in this topology are outlined in this document.</t></abstract>
