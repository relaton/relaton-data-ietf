<abstract><t>Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms of processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity.  Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices.  This document defines actors in the security architecture for authentication and authorization, analyzes the relationships between them, and describes their respective tasks and characteristics.  This knowledge will then be used to derive requirements for the communication between the actors.</t></abstract>
