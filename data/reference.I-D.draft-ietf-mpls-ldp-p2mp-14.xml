<abstract><t>This document describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol for the setup of Point-to-Multipoint and Multipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths in Multi-Protocol Label Switching networks. These extensions are also referred to as Multipoint LDP.  Multipoint LDP constructs the P2MP or MP2MP Label Switched Paths without interacting with or relying upon any other multicast tree construction protocol.  Protocol elements and procedures for this solution are described for building such Label Switched Paths in a receiver-initiated manner.  There can be various applications for Multipoint Label Switched Paths, for example IP multicast or support for multicast in BGP/MPLS L3VPNs.  Specification of how such applications can use a LDP signaled Multipoint Label Switched Path is outside the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
