<abstract><t>This document describes the RESTful Web Service for Whois data as implemented and fielded by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN).  ARIN calls this service Whois-RWS.  The purpose of this document is to facilitate discussion and serve as input into a standards process in this area, currently being discussed on the WHOIS-based Extensible Internet Registration Data Service (WEIRDS) mailing list (https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/weirds).  Please excuse this very rough initial draft.  It is roughly based on information currently published on ARIN's website.  However, future revisions of this document are planned, including discussions on lessons learned by ARIN from the deployment of Whois-RWS and thoughts on a future, unified standard.</t></abstract>
