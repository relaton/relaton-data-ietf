<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  CoAP is based on datagram transport, which limits the maximum size of resource representations that can be transferred without too much fragmentation.  A previous version of this draft defined the Block option.  The Block option provides a minimal way to transfer larger representations in a block-wise fashion.  It is currently documented in the WG draft draft-ietf-core-block-00.txt  This short I-D attempts to pick up some recent discussion on the CoRE mailing list, and defines a more general, but also slightly more complex approach.  It is intended as an example for a complete design based on this discussion, to enable a rational assessment of the relative complexities.</t></abstract>
