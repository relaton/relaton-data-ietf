<abstract><t>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used by anyone on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA instance. A URI which routes to a specific UA instance is called a Globally Routable UA URI (GRUU). An Internet-Draft is progressing toward standardization that gives a method by which proxies can construct and delver GRUUs to UAs that request them. This document distills that Internet-Draft into a guide for UA implementors.</t></abstract>
