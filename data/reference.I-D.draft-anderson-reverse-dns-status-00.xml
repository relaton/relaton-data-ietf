<abstract><t>Translation of IP addresses to domain names is an optional feature of DNS. Many sites implement it in someway, many others do not implement it at all. Over time, some myths have developed regarding reverse DNS mapping. The goal of this document is to to identify best practices, illuminate false assumptions and to report on the status of reverse DNS facilities so that DNS Administrators and operators can make informed decisions about the options for DNS reverse mapping.</t></abstract>
