<abstract><t>This document specifies SIP Certificate Authentication (SCA), a challenge-response mechanism that uses public key cryptography to perform certificate-based authentication in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based architectures. Performing authentication in SIP with certificates will provide stronger authentication capabilities and increase possible deployment scenarios in SIP networks. The scope is limited to the authentication of the SIP UA to the SIP Service Provider's network. It does not include UA to UA authentication within its scope.</t></abstract>
