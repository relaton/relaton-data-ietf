<abstract><t>This document defines a canonical string object or 'token' for verifying with non-repudiation the author of the token, their authority to author the token and, minimally, the asserted originating identity or persona contained within the token corresponding specifically to the originator of 'personal communications', or any signalled communications between a set of parties with identities.  A cryptographic signature is defined to protect the integrity of the information used to identify the originator of a personal communications session (e.g. the telephone number or URI) and verify the assertion of the identity information at the destination.  The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent to the destination party over an insecure channel.  The Persona Assertion Token (PASSporT) is particularly useful for many personal communications applications over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating and destination parties may not have a direct trusted relationship.</t></abstract>
