<abstract><t>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) v2 (RFC7970)    defines a data representation that provides a framework for sharing    information about computer security incidents commonly exchanged by    Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) .  Since the IODEF    model includes a wealth of available options that can be used to    describe a security incident or issue, it can be challenging for    security practitioners to develop tools that leverage IODEF for    incident sharing.  This document provides guidelines for IODEF    implementers.  It addresses how common security indicators can be    represented in IODEF and use-cases of how IODEF is being used.  This    document aims to make IODEF's adoption by vendors easier and    encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by CSIRTs around the    world.</t></abstract>
