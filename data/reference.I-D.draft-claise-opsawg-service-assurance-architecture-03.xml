<abstract><t>This document describes an architecture for Service Assurance for Intent-based Networking (SAIN).  This architecture aims at assuring that service instances are correctly running.  As services rely on multiple sub-services by the underlying network devices, getting the assurance of a healthy service is only possible with a holistic view of network devices.  This architecture not only helps to correlate the service degradation with the network root cause but also the impacted services when a network component fails or degrades.</t></abstract>
