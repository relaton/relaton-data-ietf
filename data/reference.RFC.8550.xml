<abstract><t>This document specifies conventions for X.509 certificate usage by Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) v4.0 agents. S/MIME provides a method to send and receive secure MIME messages, and certificates are an integral part of S/MIME agent processing. S/MIME agents validate certificates as described in RFC 5280 (&quot;Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and                                     Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile&quot;).  S/MIME agents must meet the certificate-processing requirements in this document as well as those in RFC 5280.  This document obsoletes RFC 5750.</t></abstract>
