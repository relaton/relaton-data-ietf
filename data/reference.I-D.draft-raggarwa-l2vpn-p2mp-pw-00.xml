<abstract><t>A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudo Wire (PW) is a mechanism that emulates the essential attributes of a unidirectional P2MP Telecommunications service such as P2MP ATM over a Packet Switched Network (PSN). [RFC4664] describes a number of different ways in which sets of PWs may be combined together into "Provider Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs" (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs), resulting in a number of different kinds of L2VPN. P2MP PWs enable a L2VPN to provide a Virtual Private P2MP unidirectional service (VPMS), which may be in addition to the Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) offered by the L2VPN.  This document describes how procedures outlined in [VPLS-MCAST] can be used to signal P2MP PWs and enable a P2MP unidirectional service in a L2VPN.</t></abstract>
