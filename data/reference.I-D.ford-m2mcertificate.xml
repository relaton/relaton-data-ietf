<abstract><t>The X.509 public key certificate format is overly verbose for Internet-of-Things (IoT) constrained environments, where nodes with limited memory and networks with limited bandwidth are not uncommon. The Machine-to-Machine (M2M) certificate format is a pruned down and encoding-optimized replacement for X.509, which reuses much of the X.509 semantics but reduces certificate sizes by typically 40%.  We are proposing that IETF recognize the M2M format as an optional replacement for X.509 in Internet applications including, but not limited to, TLS and DTLS.</t></abstract>
