<abstract><t>The NETCONF Event Notifications standard specifies the mechanism by which NETCONF clients can subscribe to and receive event notifications.  However, with the exception of a timestamp, no standard Notification content was defined.  This memo defines a set of information that should be included in all NETCONF notifications, information that should be included based on class of notification and also defines a set of specific notifications to support specific management functions, such as configuration.</t></abstract>
