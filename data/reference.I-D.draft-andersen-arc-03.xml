<abstract><t>Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) permits an organization which is creating or handling email to indicate their involvement with the handling process by adding a set of cryptographically signed header fields in a manner analagous to that of DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM).  Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key.  Changes in the message which may break DKIM, may be tracked through the ARC set of header fields.</t></abstract>
