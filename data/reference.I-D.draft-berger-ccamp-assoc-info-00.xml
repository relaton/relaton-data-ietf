<abstract><t>End-to-End and Segment Recovery are defined for GMPLS (Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching) controlled label switched paths (LSPs) in RFC 4872 and RFC 4873 respectively.  Both definitions use the ASSOCIATION object to associate recovery LSPs with the LSP they are protecting.  This document provides additional narrative on how such associations are to be identified.  This document does not define any new procedures or mechanisms and is strictly informative in nature.  It may not be obvious to the informed reader why this document is necessary.</t></abstract>
