<abstract><t>This document introduces extensions to Fast-handover Mobile IPv6 [6] that improves handover latency in Mobile IPv6 procedures in case mobile nodes have multiple wireless interfaces. In the basic Fast MIPv6 [6], the PAR (previous access router) forwards the arriving packets for the mobile node to the NAR (new access router) by setting up a tunnel to the NAR in order to prevent packet losses incurred by handover latency during handover procedure. Recently, many mobile nodes begin to have multiple wireless interfaces, and multiple active IPv6 Care-of-Addresses are assigned and registered simultaneously to a Home Agent [2] in order to utilize multiple wireless interfaces in terms of bandwidth, delay, etc. Furthermore, the Mobile IPv6 with extension to multiple CoA registration also needs fast handover procedure to reduce handover latency and packet losses. However, in the Mobile IPv6 with multiple CoA registration, packet tunneling to a NAR during handoff of one interface can incur performance degradation due to severe packet reordering when multiple interfaces are simultaneously used for load sharing. This is because the partial traffic flow coming from the interface involved in handover is suspended during handover and later tunneled to a NAR, while the other partial traffic flow is continuously forwarded to the mobile node through the other stable interface, which could incur severe reordering if the handover is delayed or unstable by ping-pong effects. We thus propose in this document an extension to Fast handover Mobile IPv6 procedure which can indicate a specific tunneling destination except the NAR, for example, other interfaces (or CoAs) in the same mobile node. This extension not only enhances the traffic quality during handoff but also improves the handover signaling performance because data traffic is redirected to another interface during handover signaling.</t></abstract>
