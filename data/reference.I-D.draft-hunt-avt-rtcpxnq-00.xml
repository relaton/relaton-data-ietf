<abstract><t>This document describes an RTCP XR report block which reports packet transport parameters. The report block was developed by BT for pre- standards use in BT's next generation network. This document has been produced to describe the report block in sufficient detail to register the block type with IANA, rather than with the intention of standardising the report block for use outside BT's network.</t></abstract>
