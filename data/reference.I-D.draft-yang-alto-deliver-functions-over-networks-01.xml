<abstract><t>As the rapid development of the Internet, huge amounts of data are being generated.  To satisfy user demands, service providers deploy services near the edge networks.  In order to achieve better performances, computing functions and user traffic need to be scheduled properly.  However, it is challenging to efficiently schedule resources among the distributed edge servers due to the lack of underlying information, e.g., network topology, traffic distribution, link delay/bandwidth, utilization/capability of computing servers.  In this document, we employ the ALTO protocol to help deliver functions and schedule traffic within the edge computing platform.  The protocol will provide information of multiple resources for the distributed edge computing platform.  The usage of ALTO will improve the efficiency of function delivery in edge computing.</t></abstract>
