<abstract><t>The purpose of this draft is to simplify the design of MLD Snooping switches and provide a method for Solicited Node multicast addresses to be sent to every port to improve network robustment and management. IPv6 Addressing Architecture requires that all nodes must join the associated Solicited-Node multicast addresses for every unicast and anycast address it is assigned. This causes MLD snooping switches to create potentially huge multicast forwarding tables just to handle Neighbor Discovery. A simple change to alleviate this would be to allow switches to forward a range of addresses that include the Solicited-Node multicast addresses to every port. This also could help in network discovery. Similarly the same allowance could be made for Local Network Control Block (LNCB) addresses.</t></abstract>
