<abstract><t>This document introduces a policy-based resource management and orchestration framework which aims at contributing towards the current namesake NFVRG near-term work items.  It describes key points of the recursive resource orchestration framework developed within the wider research area of federated virtual network function orchestration.  The document also relates this effort with respect to other orchestration frameworks, thus addressing both the NFV research and practitioner communities.</t></abstract>
