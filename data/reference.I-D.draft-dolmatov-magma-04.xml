<abstract><t>In addition to a new cipher with block length of n=128 bits (referred as "Kyznyechik" and described in RFC 7801) Russian Federal standard GOST R 34.12-2015 includes an updated version of the block cipher with block length of n=64 bits and key length k=256 bits, which is also referred as "Magma".  The algorithm is an updated version of older block cipher with block length of n=64 bits described in GOST 28147-89 (RFC 5830).  This document is intended to be a source of information about the updated version of 64-bit cipher.  It may facilitate the use of the block cipher in Internet applications by providing information for developers and users of GOST 64-bit cipher with the revised version of the cipher for encryption and decryption.</t></abstract>
