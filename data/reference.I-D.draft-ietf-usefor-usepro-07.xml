<abstract><t>This document defines the architecture of Netnews systems and specifies the correct manipulation and interpretation of Netnews articles by software which originates, distributes, stores, and displays them. It also specifies the requirements that must be met by any protocol used to transport and serve Netnews articles. Backward compatibility has been a major goal of this endeavour, but where this standard and earlier documents or practices conflict, this standard should be followed. In most such cases, current practice is already compatible with these changes. A companion Best Current Practice document [USEAGE], addressing requirements which are present for Social rather than Normative reasons is in preparation.</t></abstract>
