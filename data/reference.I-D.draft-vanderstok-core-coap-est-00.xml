<abstract><t>Low-resource devices in a Low-power and Lossy Network (LLN) can operate in a mesh network using the IPv6 over Low-power Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) and IEEE 802.15.4 link-layer standards. Provisioning these devices in a secure manner with keys (often called security bootstrapping) used to encrypt and authenticate messages is the subject of Bootstrapping of Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].  Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030], based on TLS and HTTP, is used for BRSKI.  This document defines how low-resource devices are expected to use EST over DTLS and CoAP. 6LoWPAN fragmentation management and minor extensions to CoAP are needed to enable EST over DTLS-secured CoAP (EST-coaps).</t></abstract>
