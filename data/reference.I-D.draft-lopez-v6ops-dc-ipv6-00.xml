<abstract><t>This document describes the issues, possible solutions, and opportunities in Data Center (DC) migration from IPv4 to IPv6.  It focuses on the DC infrastructure itself, its operation, and the aspects related to DC interconnection through IPv6.  It does not consider the particular mechanisms for making Internet services provided by applications hosted in the DC available through IPv6 beyond the specific aspects related to how their deployed on the DC infrastructure.  Apart from facilitating the migration procedure itself, the mechanisms outlined here are intended to make this migration as transparent as possible (if not completely transparent) to applications and services running on the DC infrastructure, as well as to take advantage of IPv6 features to simplify DC operations, internally and across the Internet.</t></abstract>
