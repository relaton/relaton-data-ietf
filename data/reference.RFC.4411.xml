<title>Extending the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header for Preemption Events</title>
<author initials='J.' surname='Polk' fullname='J. Polk'><organization /></author>
<date year='2006' month='February' />
<abstract><t>This document proposes an IANA Registration extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Reason Header to be included in a BYE Method Request as a result of a session preemption event, either at a user agent (UA), or somewhere in the network involving a reservation-based protocol such as the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) or Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS).  This document does not attempt to address routers failing in the packet path; instead, it addresses a deliberate tear down of a flow between UAs, and informs the terminated UA(s) with an indication of what occurred.
