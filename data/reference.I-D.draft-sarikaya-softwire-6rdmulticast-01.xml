<abstract><t>This memo specifies modifications required to 6rd so that both IPv6 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv6 servers.  The protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge and then tunneling MLD messages to 6rd Border Relays where IPv6 multicast routing is supported.  Multicast data received at 6rd Border Relay is tunneled to 6rd Customer Edge node and then delivered to the hosts.  We show that IPv4 multicast and IGMP can be supported in a similar way.</t></abstract>
