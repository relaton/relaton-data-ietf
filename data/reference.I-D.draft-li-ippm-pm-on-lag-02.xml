<abstract><t>This document defines extensions to One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP), Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP), and Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) to implement performance measurement on every member link of a Link Aggregation Group (LAG).  With the measured metrics of each member links of a LAG, it enables operators to enforce performance metric based traffic steering policy among the member links.</t></abstract>
