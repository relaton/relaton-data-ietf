<abstract><t>This document lists logging capabilities originally defined in RFC3871 and needed to support current operational practices, including those described in the Operational Security Current Practices document[CURPRAC] Logging is defined as the delivery of messages about the device, the data passing through the device, or the device's interaction with another device. This document may be used in conjunction with the other capabilities documents to operate a secure networking environment. Capabilities are defined without reference to specific technologies. This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies that implement the capability. Each capability cites the practices it supports. Current implementations that support the capability are cited. Special considerations are discussed as appropriate listing operational and resource constraints, limitations of current implementations, trade-offs, etc.</t></abstract>
