<abstract><t>This document describes an innovative frame, called PLIC,("Performance Layer Inboard Computing") able to support active, passive or hybrid performance measurements on any kind of unicast and multicast service passing through a network. It is based on an algorithm which, through a distributed computation, floods the performance measurements of each node to the rest of the network, without necessity of any external topology database or operation support system. It has been invented and engineered in the Telecom Italia Core Network.</t></abstract>
