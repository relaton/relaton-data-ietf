<abstract><t>A third party authorization label (TPA-Label) is a DNS-based prefix for DKIM ADSP records that acts as a scheme for domains to authorize acceptable third-party signatures for messages containing their domain within the From header.  This scheme allows Author Domains to autonomously authorize a range of third-party domains using scalable, individual DNS transactions.  This authorization extends the scope of DKIM signing practice assertions as a means to supplant more difficult to administer schemes.  Alternatives for facilitating third-party authorizations currently necessitate the coordination between two or more domains to synchronously set up selector/key DNS records, DNS zone delegations, and/or the regular exchange of public/ private keys.  Checking TPA-Label Resource Records for signing practices may occur when an Author Domain Signature is missing or is invalid and a Third Party Signature exists.  When a third-party signature is found, TPA- Label Resource Record transactions offer an efficient means for Author Domains to authorize specific third-party signing domains and for recipients to determine whether an authorization exists.  The TPA-Label Resource Record scheme reduces reliance upon email source reputation that is often based upon an IP address rather than the domain.</t></abstract>
