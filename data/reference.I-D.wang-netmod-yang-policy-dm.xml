<abstract><t>This document describes a YANG data model for network policies using Language Abstractions defined in RFC6095.  The model intends to be applied to deliver various different network services by controlling the policies that enable features such as QoS, Security, etc.  In future, the core data model could be augmented by additional YANG data modules modeling and configuring policy-related protocols and functions.  The policy data model described in this document provides common building blocks for such extensions.  Earlier revisions of this document were written to trigger discussion with operator community at IETF-92 in Dallas.  This document has been updated to reflect the limited conclusions of those discussions and record them for archival purposes.  There is no intent to advance this document any further toward publication.</t></abstract>
