<title>Component Link Recording and Resource Control for TE Link Bundles</title>

<date month='July' day='6' year='2008' />

<abstract><t>Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been used extensively by the service providers. However, when TE links are bundled, identification of label resource in Record Route Object (RRO) is not enough for the administrative purpose. Network service  A.Zamfir et al. - Expires Janury 2009  [page 1]  Component Link Record. &amp; Resource Control for TE Link Bundles Jul.2008  providers would like to know the component link within a TE link that is being used by a given LSP. In other words, when link bundling is used, resource recording requires mechanisms to specify the component link identifier, along with the TE link identifier and Label. As it is not possible to record component link in the RRO, this draft defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to specify component link identifiers for resource recording purposes.  This draft also defines the Explicit Route Object (ERO) counterpart of the RRO extension. The ERO extensions are needed to perform explicit label/ resource control over bundled TE link. Hence, this document defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] and [RFC3473] to specify component link identifiers for explicit resource control and recording over TE link bundles.</t></abstract>
