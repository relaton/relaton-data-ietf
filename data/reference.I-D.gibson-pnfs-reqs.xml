<abstract><t>This draft specifies the requirements that should be satisfied in the definition of a parallel NFS protocol and the considerations recommended for its designs. It responds to the scalable bandwidth problem described in the pNFS Problem Statement, draft-gibson-pnfs-problem-statement-01.txt. In the interest of a timely adoption of scalable bandwidth file service, parallel NFS is proposed to be a NFSv4 minor extension for communicating file layout available through existing and future storage subsystem protocols such as other NFSv4 file servers (NFS), block-based SCSI subsystems (SBC), and object-based SCSI (OSD) subsystems.</t></abstract>
