<abstract><t>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the Internet today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  In P2P applications, one technique for reducing the transit and uplink P2P traffic is to introduce storage capabilities within the network.  Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web caches) provide such storage, but they can be complex (e.g., P2P caches need to explicitly support individual P2P application protocols), and do not allow users to manage resource usage policies for content in the cache.  This document discusses the introduction of in-network storage for P2P applications and shows the need for a standard protocol for accessing this storage.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
