<abstract><t>Wireless Sensors networks (WSNs) are type of wireless ad-hoc networks with reduced or no mobility. These networks combine wireless communication with minimal onboard computation facilities for sensing and monitoring of physical and environmental phenomena. Much work has been reported on different aspects of wireless sensors networks;however,less attention has been paid on addressing fault detection and recovery in these networks. Fault could be any thing which can lead communication break down as a whole or part of a wireless sensors network.Thus, detection of such fault attains a primary focus to support routine operations within such networks. Mobile Ad-hoc On Demand Data Delivery Protocol (MAODDP) belongs to on-demand data delivery type routing family of mobile ad-hoc networks. The contribution of this paper is to introduce an efficient fault detection and recovery mechanism for WSNs network. We believe proposed two step model can offer a robust solution for the fault management in Wireless Sensors Network.</t></abstract>
