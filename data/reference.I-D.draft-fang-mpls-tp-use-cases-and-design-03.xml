<abstract><t>This document provides use case studies and network design considerations for Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  In the recent years, MPLS-TP has emerged as the technology of choice to meet the needs of transport evolution. Many service providers (SPs) intend to replace SONET/SDH, TDM, ATM traditional transport technologies with MPLS-TP, to achieve higher efficiency, lower operational cost, while maintaining transport characteristics.  The use cases for MPLS-TP include Mobile backhaul, Metro Ethernet access and aggregation, and packet optical transport.  The design considerations include the following aspects: 1) operational considerations; 2) common topologies and feature set; 3) compatibility with IP/MPLS networks; 4) Potential issues need to be solved.  The end goal is to provide reliable, manageable, and scalable transport solutions with lower cost.  [page 1]  MPLS-TP Use Cases Studies and Design Considerations April 2011</t></abstract>
