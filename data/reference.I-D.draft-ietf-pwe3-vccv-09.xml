<abstract><t>This document describes Virtual Circuit Connection Verification (VCCV) procedures for use with pseudo wire (PW) connections. VCCV supports connection verification applications for PWs regardless of the underlying public service network technology. VCCV makes use of IP-based protocols to perform operations and maintenance functions. This is accomplished by providing a control channel associated with each PW. A network operator may use the VCCV procedures to test the network's forwarding plane liveliness.</t></abstract>
