<abstract><t>Topology Dissemination Based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is a proactive, link-state routing protocol designed for mobile ad-hoc networks, which provides hop-by-hop routing along shortest paths to each destination.  Each node running TBRPF computes a source tree (providing paths to all reachable nodes) based on partial topology information stored in its topology table, using a modification of Dijkstra's algorithm.  To minimize overhead, each node reports only *part* of its source tree to neighbors.  TBRPF uses a combination of periodic and differential updates to keep all neighbors informed of the reported part of its source tree.  Each node also has the option to report additional topology information (up to the full topology), to provide improved robustness in highly mobile networks.  TBRPF performs neighbor discovery using &quot;differential&quot; HELLO messages which report only *changes* in the status of neighbors.  This results in HELLO messages that are much smaller than those of other link-state routing protocols such as OSPF.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
