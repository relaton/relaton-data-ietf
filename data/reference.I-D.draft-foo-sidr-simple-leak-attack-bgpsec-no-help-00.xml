<abstract><t>This document describes a very simple attack vector that illustrates how RPKI-enabled BGPSEC machinery as currently defined can be easily circumvented in order to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack via BGP.  It is meant to serve as input to the SIDR WG during routing security requirements specification and discussions, and secure routing protocol designs.</t></abstract>
