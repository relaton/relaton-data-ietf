<abstract><t>IP mobility protocols allow nodes to maintain a somewhat permanent IP address as they change points of attachment to the Internet. There are various levels and types of mobility management available for local and global mobility, and several protocols have been developed to support them. Even though each of the IP mobility management protocols may have its own set of scope and functions, analysis has shown that a generalized threat model is applicable. This document describes a threat model for IP mobility.</t></abstract>
