<abstract><t>With the overwhelming choice of proprietary implementations of centralized control and management of wireless access points and access controllers there is a great demand for a standard protocol and architecture that enables the deployment of large scale wireless networks. This document describes the CAPWAP Tunneling Protocol, a protocol that allows for the centralized control and provisioning of a large number of wireless access points from access controllers. It is supported by an architecture where the MAC layer of the RF technology is terminated within the AP. This allows for the protocol to be extensible to multiple radio technologies. It assumes an IP connection between the access points and access controllers and has signaling primitives to enable wireless station mobility between access points. Therefore, seamless Layer 3 subnet mobility is seamlessly enabled by this protocol.</t></abstract>
