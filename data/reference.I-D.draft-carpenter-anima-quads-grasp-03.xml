<abstract><t>A secure substrate known as the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) is required by the Generic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) used by Autonomic Service Agents.  This document describes QUADS, a QUick And Dirty Secure ACP using symmetric cryptography and preconfigured keys or passwords.  It also describes a simplistic QUADS Key Infrastructure based on asymmetric cryptography used over insecure instances of GRASP to create a QUADS ACP.</t></abstract>
