<abstract><t>Some IPsec implementations support Security Labels otherwise known as Security Contexts, to be configured as a selector within the Security Policy Database (SPD) for IPsec SAs.  This document adds support to IKEv2 to negotiate these Security Labels or Contexts using a new Traffic Selector (TS) Type TS_SECLABEL.  The approach is named "Labeled IPsec".  It assumes that the SPD processing of RFC 4303 is already extended to support Security Labels.  This document only adds the ability for IKE to negotiate the Security Labels used with the SPD.</t></abstract>
