<abstract><t>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam and attach to different access networks without disrupting the ongoing sessions that nodes of the network may have.  By extending the Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile Routers, nodes of the network are not required to support any kind of mobility, since packets must go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional tunnel. Communications from/to a mobile network have to traverse the Home Agent, and therefore better paths may be available.  Additionally, this solution adds packet overhead, due to the encapsulation.  This document describes an approach to the Route Optimisation for NEMO, based on the well-known concept of Correspondent Router.  The solution aims at meeting the currently identified NEMO Route Optimisation requirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration.  Based on the ideas that have been proposed in the past, as well as some other extensions, this document describes a Correspondent Router based solution, trying to identify the most important open issues.  The main goal of this first version of the document is to describe an initial NEMO RO solution based on the deployment of Correspondent Routers and trigger the discussion within the MEXT WG about this kind of solution.  This document (in an appendix) also analyses how a Correspondent Router based solution fits each of the currently identified NEMO Route Optimisation requirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration.</t></abstract>
