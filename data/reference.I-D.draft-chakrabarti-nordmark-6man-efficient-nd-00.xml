<abstract><t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed for neighbor's address resolution, unreachability detection, address autoconfiguration, router advertisement and solicitation.  With the progress of Internet adoption on various industries including home, wireless, m2m and Cellular(LTE) networks, there is a desire for optimizing legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol to be more efficient in terms of number of signaling messages in the network. This document describes a method of optimization by reducing periodic multicast messages, frequent Neighbor Solicitation messages and supports interoperability with legacy IPv6 nodes and avoids Duplicate Address Detection by introducing an address Registration mechanism. Efficient IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol is useful for energy- efficient IPv6 networks as well as Data Center and Home Networks.</t></abstract>
