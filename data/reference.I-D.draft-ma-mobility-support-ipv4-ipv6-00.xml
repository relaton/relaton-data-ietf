<abstract><t>This document specifies a protocol named Mobile IPv4/v6, which allows mobile nodes to remain reachable while moving in IPv4/v6 mixed networks. A translation gateway called Mobile IPv4/v6 Translation Gateway (MIPv4/v6-TG) is introduced in this protocol. MIPv4/v6-TG is based on NAT-PT gateway and equipped with a newly introduced application level gateway called MIP-ALG. MIPv4/v6-TG is located between IPv4 network and IPv6 network. On IPv4 network side, MIPv4/v6-TG acts as a Mobile IPv4 entity and interacts with other Mobile IPv4 entities under Mobile IPv4, while on IPv6 network side, it acts as a Mobile IPv6 entity and interacts with other Mobile IPv6 entities under Mobile IPv6. In MIPv4/v6-TG, Mobile IPv4 entities and Mobile IPv6 entities are translated with each other. In order to maintain each of Mobile IP sessions that pass through MIPv4/v6-TG, a data structure called Mobile IP Table is introduced.</t></abstract>
