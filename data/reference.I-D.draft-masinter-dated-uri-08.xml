<abstract><t>This document defines two URI schemes.  The first, 'duri' (standing for "dated URI"), identifies a resource as of a particular time. This allows explicit reference to the "time of retrieval", similar to the way in which bibliographic references containing URIs are often written.  The second scheme, 'tdb' ( standing for "Thing Described By"), provides a way of minting URIs for something by the means of identifying a description as of a particular time.  Note  This document is not a product of any working group.  Many of the ideas here have been discussed since 2001.  Versions of this document have been discussed on the mailing list &lt;uri@w3.org>.  Previous versions have couched 'tdb' and 'tdb' as URN namespaces, used different syntax for timestamps, and handled URIs with fragment identifiers differently.</t></abstract>
