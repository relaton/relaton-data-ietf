<abstract><t>This document outlines a specialized, dynamic routing protocol for Clos and fat-tree network topologies.  The protocol (1) deals with fully automated construction of fat-tree topologies based on detection of links, (2) minimizes the amount of routing state held at each level, (3) automatically prunes and load balances topology flooding exchanges over a sufficient subset of links, (4) supports automatic disaggregation of prefixes on link and node failures to prevent black-holing and suboptimal routing, (5) allows traffic steering and re-routing policies, (6) allows loop-free non-ECMP forwarding, (7) automatically re-balances traffic towards the spines based on bandwidth available and finally (8) provides mechanisms to synchronize a limited key-value data-store that can be used after protocol convergence to e.g.  bootstrap higher levels of functionality on nodes.</t></abstract>
