<abstract><t>LCVP allows a client to delegate certificate path validation to a trusted server. The path validation (e.g. making sure that none of the certificates in the path are revoked) is performed according to a set of rules called a validation policy. It allows simplification of client implementations and only uses of a set of predefined validation policies. This document defines a protocol that can be used to: (1) validate one certificate according to one validation policy, (2) query the validation policies supported by an LCVP server.</t></abstract>
