<abstract><t>Some Internet Service Providers and enterprises require detailed information about the payload of traffic, so that packets can be treated differently and efficiently.  Packet-level differentiation can also enable flow-level and user-level differentiation.  With its large address space, IPv6 allows semantics to be embedded into addresses by assigning additional significance to specific bits within the prefix.  Using these semantics, routers and other intermediary devices can easily apply relevant policies as required. This document describes a framework for such an approach.  It also analyses the technical advantages and limitations associated with such an approach.  This informational document only discusses the usage of semantics within a single network, or group of interconnected networks which share a common addressing policy, referred to as a Semantic Prefix Domain.  The document is NOT intended to suggest the standardization of any common global semantics.</t></abstract>
