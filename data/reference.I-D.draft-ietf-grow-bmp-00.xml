<abstract><t>This document proposes a simple protocol, BMP, which can be used to monitor BGP sessions.  BMP is intended to provide a more convenient interface for obtaining route views for research purpose than the screen-scraping approach in common use today.  The design goals are to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented, and minimally service-affecting.  BMP is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.</t></abstract>
