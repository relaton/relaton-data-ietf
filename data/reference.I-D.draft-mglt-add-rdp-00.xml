<abstract><t>This document describes the DNS Resolver Discovery Protocol (RDP) that enables a DNS client to discover various available DNS resolving services instantiated as resolvers.  These resolvers can be local and global.  The discovery is primarily initiated by a DNS client, but a resolver may also inform the DNS client with other resolver services.</t></abstract>
