<abstract><t>Dual-Stack Lite, combining IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel and Carrier Grade NAT technologies, provides an approach that offers IPv4 service via IPv6 network by sharing IPv4 addresses among customers during IPv6 transition period. Dual-stack lite, however, requires CGN to maintain active NAT sessions, which means processing performance, memory size and log abilities for NAT sessions should scale with number of sessions of subscribers; Hence increasing in CAPEX for operators would be resulted in when traffic increase.  This document propose the NAT offload extensions to DS-Lite, which allows offloading NAT translation function from centralized network side (AFTR) to distributed customer equipments (B4), thereby offering a trade-off between CAPEX (e.g. less performance requirements on AFTR device) and OPEX (e.g., easy and fast deployment of Dual-Stack Lite) for operators. The ability of easily co-deploying with basic Dual- Stack Lite is essential to NAT offload extension to DS-Lite.</t></abstract>
