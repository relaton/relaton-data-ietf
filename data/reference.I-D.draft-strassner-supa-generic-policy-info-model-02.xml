<abstract><t>Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines an interface to a network management function that takes high-level, possibly network-wide policies as input and creates element configuration snippets as output. SUPA addresses the needs of operators and application developers to represent multiple types of policy rules, which vary in the level of abstraction, to suit the needs of different actors. This document defines a single common extensible framework for representing different types of policy rules, in the form of a set of information model fragments, that is independent of language, protocol, repository, and the level of abstraction of the content of the policy rule. This enables a common set of concepts defined in this set of information models to be mapped into different data models that use different languages, protocols, and repositories to optimize their usage. The definition of common policy concepts also provides better interoperability by ensuring that each data model can share a set of common concepts, independent of its level of detail or the language, protocol, and/or repository that it is using.  Specifically, this document defines three information models:</t></abstract>
