<abstract><t>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks.  Security for the protocol can be supplied in a number of ways.  The mandatory-to-implement security mode for CoAP makes use of DTLS.  Other applications may want to use IPsec.  This document will discuss considerations for the use of IPsec with CoAP.  It will be advanced on a timescale separate from the main CoAP specification, as most experience in securing CoAP so far has been made with DTLS.  The current version of this specification is a placeholder, built out of text extracted from draft-ietf-core-coap-12.  It is meant to pick up http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/ticket/262 and provide a home for its considerations.  It might be merged with other documents later.</t></abstract>
