<abstract><t>RFCs 3689 and 3690 detail requirements for an Emergency Telecommunications Service (ETS), of which an Internet Emergency Preparedness Service (IEPS) would be a part. Some of these types of services require call preemption; others call for call queuing or other mechanisms. IEPS requires a Call Admission Control (CAC) procedure and a Per Hop Behavior for the data which meet the needs of this architecture. Such a CAC procedure and PHB is appropriate to any service that might use H.323 or SIP to set up real time sessions. The key requirement is to guarantee an elevated probability of call completion to an authorized user in time of crisis. This document primarily discusses supporting ETS in the context of the US Government and NATO, because it focuses on the MLPP and GETS standards. The architectures described here are applicable beyond these organizations.</t></abstract>
