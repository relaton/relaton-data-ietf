<abstract><t>Many Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs) have converged on simplified layer 3 routing.  Furthermore, requirements for operational simplicity have led many of these MSDCs to converge on BGP as their single routing protocol for both their fabric routing and their Data Center Interconnect (DCI) routing.  This document describes extensions to BGP to use BGP Link-State distribution and the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm used by Internal Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF.  In doing this, it allows BGP to be efficiently used as both the underlay protocol and the overlay protocol in MSDCs.</t></abstract>
