<abstract><t>This document describes several Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal techniques that was considered to be used by Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP).  Each technique includes a description on how it would be used, the security implications of using it and any other deployment considerations it has.  There are also disussions on how NAT traversal techniques relates to firewalls and how each technique can be applied in different use cases.  These findings where used when selecting the NAT traversal for RTSP 2.0 standardized in the MMUSIC WG.</t></abstract>
