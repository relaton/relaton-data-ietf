<abstract><t>Software-Defined Networking introduces an abstraction layer and by doing so separates the Forwarding from the Control layer.  This separation can allow faster innovation cycles at both layers as experience has already shown.  However, there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what is the layer stucture in an SDN architecture and how do layers interface with each other.  This document aims to provide a concise reference for future discussions in SDNRG.</t></abstract>
