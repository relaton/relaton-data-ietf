<abstract><t>RFCs were initially intended as, literally, requests for comments. Since then, they have turned into standards documents, with a peculiar process to report errors and a highly onerous process to actually have the RFC modified/republished.  Non-IETF participants are typically unaware of any way to provide feedback to published RFCs, other than direct email to the listed authors.  This is very different from the way many web specifications are developed today and arguably leads to the value of published RFCs diminishing over time.  This document proposes an experiment to remedy this situation through the deployment of web annotations.</t></abstract>
