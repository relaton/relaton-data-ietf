<abstract><t>This memo defines a data structure that can be appended to selected ICMP messages.  The ICMP extension defined herein can be used to identify any combination of the following: the IP interface upon which a datagram arrived, the sub-IP component of an IP interface upon which a datagram arrived, the IP interface through which the datagram would have been forwarded had it been forwardable, and the IP next hop to which the datagram would have been forwarded.</t><t>Devices can use this ICMP extension to identify interfaces and their components by any combination of the following: ifIndex, IPv4 address, IPv6 address, name, and MTU.  ICMP-aware devices can use these extensions to identify both numbered and unnumbered interfaces.   [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
