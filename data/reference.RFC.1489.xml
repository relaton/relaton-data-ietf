<title>Registration of a Cyrillic Character Set</title>

<abstract><t>Though the proposed character set &quot;koi8-r&quot; is not currently an international standard, there is very large user community (including Relcom Net) supporting it.  Factually, &quot;koi8-r&quot; is de-facto standard for Unix and global network applications in the former Soviet Union.  This is the reason the Society of Unix User Groups (SUUG) believes &quot;koi8-r&quot; should be registered.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does not specify an Internet standard.</t></abstract>
