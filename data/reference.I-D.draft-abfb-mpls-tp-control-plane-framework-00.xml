<abstract><t>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) supports both static  provisioning of transport paths via an NMS/OSS, and dynamic  provisioning of transport paths via a control plane. This  document provides the framework for MPLS-TP dynamic  provisioning, and covers control plane signaling, routing,  addressing, traffic engineering, path computation, and  recovery in the event of network failures. The document  focuses on the control of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as the  Pseudowire (PW) control plane is not modified by MPLS-TP.  MPLS-TP uses GMPLS as the control plane for MPLS-TP LSPs.  Backwards compatibility to MPLS is required. Management plane,  manual configuration, the triggering of LSP setup, label  allocation schemes, and hybrid services are out of scope of  this document.</t></abstract>
