<abstract><t>The signaling protocols used to establish point-to-point pseudowires include type-length-value (TLV) fields that identify pseudowire endpoints called attachment individual identifiers (AII). This document defines AII structures in the form of new AII type-length- value fields that support AII aggregation for improved scalability and VPN autodiscovery. It is envisioned that this would be useful in large inter-domain virtual private wire service networks where pseudowires are established between selected local and remote PE nodes based on customer need.</t></abstract>
