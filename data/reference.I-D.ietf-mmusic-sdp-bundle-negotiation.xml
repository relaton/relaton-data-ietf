<abstract><t>This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used with the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single transport (5-tuple) for sending and receiving media described by multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" sections).  Such transport is referred to as a BUNDLE transport, and the media is referred to as bundled media.  The "m=" sections that use the BUNDLE transport form a BUNDLE group.  This specification updates RFC 3264, to also allow assigning a zero port value to a "m=" section in cases where the media described by the "m=" section is not disabled or rejected.  This specification updates RFC 5888, to also allow an SDP 'group' attribute to contain an identification-tag that identifies a "m=" section with the port set to zero.  This specification defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) source description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension that can be used to correlate bundled RTP/RTCP packets with their appropriate "m=" section.  This specification updates RFC 7941, by adding an exception, for the MID RTP header extension, to the requirement regarding protection of an SDES RTP header extension carrying an SDES item for the MID RTP header extension.</t></abstract>
