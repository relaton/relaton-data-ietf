<abstract><t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables DHCPv6 servers to configure network parameters.  To secure DHCPv6, the authentication and encryption mechanisms are proposed to protect the DHCPv6 privacy information.  However, how to deploy the secure DHCPv6 mechanisms for DHCPv6 is not specified.  This draft analysis the DHCPv6 threat model and various key management schemes for DHCPv6 deployment, and recommend the opportunistic security for DHCPv6 deployment.</t></abstract>
