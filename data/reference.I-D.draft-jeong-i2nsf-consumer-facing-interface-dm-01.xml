<abstract><t>This document describes a YANG data model for security management that is based on Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) by using Network Functions Virtualization (NFV).  This document proposes a security management architecture based on I2NSF framework.  Note that the I2NSF framework consists of I2NSF User, Security Management System (i.e., Security Controller and Developer's Management System), and the instances of Network Security Functions (NSFs) in the lowest layer of the framework.  I2NSF User consists of Application Logic, Policy Updater, and Event Collector.  Security Controller consists of Security Policy Manager and NSF Capability Manager.  This document explains a data model to perform the missions for a security service (i.e., VoIP-VoLTE) in I2NSF security management system.</t></abstract>
