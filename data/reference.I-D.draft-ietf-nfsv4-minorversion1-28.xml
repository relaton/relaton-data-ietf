<abstract><t>This document describes NFS version 4 minor version one, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor version zero which is specified in RFC3530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.  Major extensions introduced in NFS version 4 minor version one include: Sessions, Directory Delegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS).  NFS version 4 minor version one has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version zero, and is considered a separate protocol.  Thus this document neither updates nor obsoletes RFC3530. NFS minor version one is deemed superior to NFS minor version zero with no loss of functionality, and its use is preferred over version zero.  Both NFS minor version zero and one can be used simultaneously on the same network, between the same client and server.</t></abstract>
