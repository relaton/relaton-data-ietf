<abstract><t>Cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different cost metrics.  Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285) defines only a single cost metric (i.e., the generic &quot;routingcost&quot; metric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint cost request to determine the resource provider that offers better delay performance, the base protocol does not define the cost metric to be used.</t><t> This document addresses the issue by introducing network performance metrics, including network delay, jitter, packet loss rate, hop count, and bandwidth.</t><t> There are multiple sources (e.g., estimation based on measurements or service-level agreement) to derive a performance metric.  This document introduces an additional &quot;cost-context&quot; field to the ALTO &quot;cost-type&quot; field to convey the source of a performance metric.</t></abstract>
