<abstract><t>The 6LoWPAN IETF working group is developing protocols to allow IPv6 end-to-end communication with sensors networks.  Low-power MAC protocols such as IEEE 802.15.4 impose a slightly reduced frame size. To enable IPv6 communication, 6LoWPAN proposes to use fragmentation and header compression techniques.  This document proposes an extension to the 6LoWPAN proposal and defines a class of sensors that can be joined at the network level while ignoring their own global IPv6 address.  This architecture centralizes the address management on the sensor network gateway (the PAN Coordinator) and allows the suppression of the Neighbor Discovery Protocol.  Consequently, the insertion of sensors in such a network is faster and the traffic within the network, largely composed of broadcast messages generated by Neighbor Discovery Protocol, is reduced.  We investigate the impact of this architecture on star and mesh topologies.</t></abstract>
