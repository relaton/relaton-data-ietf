<abstract><t>Continuity Check, Proactive Connectivity Verification and Remote Defect Indication functionalities are required for MPLS-TP OAM.  Continuity Check monitors the integrity of the continuity of the label switched path for any loss of continuity defect. Connectivity verification monitors the integrity of the routing of the label switched path between sink and source for any connectivity issues. Remote defect indication enables an End Point to report, to its associated End Point, a fault or defect condition that it detects on a pseudo wire, label switched path or Section.  This document specifies methods for proactive continuity check, continuity verification, and remote defect indication for MPLS-TP label switched paths, pseudo wires and Sections using Bidirectional Forwarding Detection.</t></abstract>
