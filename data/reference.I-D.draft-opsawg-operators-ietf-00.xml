<abstract><t>Internet Society has launched a new project to address the perceived gap between Operators and the IETF.  The objective of this project is ultimately to facilitate communications between the operator community and the IETF to help ensure that operational realities inform the development of key standards.  The first phase of this project was a survey of the operator community that was conducted over the first half of 2014.  This I-D aims to synthesize the initial survey results, along with information we collected directly from operators during the survey window.  The primary purpose of doing this is to start a conversation which we hope will lead to increases in the level of operational input and feedback to the IETF standards making process.</t></abstract>
