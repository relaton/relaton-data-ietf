<abstract><t>This document describes some scenarios in which one can imagine that the ability of authoritarian regime to censor news dissemination is reduced.  It tries to draw some conclusions about what's desirable and what's not acceptable for users in those scenarios.  The CensorFree objective is to standardize the protocols for microblogging on smartphones with a focus on security and censorship resistance.  Microblog entries are short text messages, possibly enriched with pictures or streaming video.  The goal is to devise protocols which guard against all known forms of censorship such as: cyberspace sabotage, digital eavesdropping, infiltration, fraud, Internet kill switches and lawyer-based attacks with the best known protective methods.</t></abstract>
