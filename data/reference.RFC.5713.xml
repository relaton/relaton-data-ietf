<abstract><t>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) aims to communicate Quality of Service (QoS)-related, service-related, and subscriber-related configurations and operations between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node (e.g., a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)).  The main goal of this protocol is to allow the NAS to configure, manage, and control access equipment, including the ability for the Access Nodes to report information to the NAS.</t><t>This present document investigates security threats that all ANCP nodes could encounter.  This document develops a threat model for ANCP security, with the aim of deciding which security functions are required.  Based on this, security requirements regarding the Access Node Control Protocol are defined.  This document is not an Internet  Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
