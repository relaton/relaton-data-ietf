<abstract><t>Many applications that use SCTP want the ability to "reset" a stream. The intention of resetting a stream is to set the numbering sequence of the stream back to 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the upper layer that this has been performed.  The applications that want this feature want it so that they can "re-use" streams for different purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number so that the application can track the message flows.  Thus, without this feature, a new use of an old stream would result in message numbers greater than expected unless there is a protocol mechanism to "reset the streams back to zero".  This document also includes methods for resetting the transport sequence numbers, adding additional streams and resetting all stream sequence numbers.</t></abstract>
