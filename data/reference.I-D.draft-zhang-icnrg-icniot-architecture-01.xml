<abstract><t>The Internet of Things (IoT) technology promises to connect billions of objects to Internet.  Today, the IoT landscape is very fragmented from both the technology and service perspectives.  As a consequence, it is difficult to integrate and cross-correlate data coming from the heterogeneous contexts and build value-added services on top.  This reason has motivated the current trend to develop a unified de- fragmented IoT architecture so that objects can be made accessible to applications across organizations and domains.  Several proposals have been made to build a unified IoT architecture as an overlay on top of today's Internet.  Such overlay solutions, however, inherit the existing limitations of the IP protocol: mobility, security, scalability, and communication reliability.  To address this problem, A unified IoT architecture based on the Information Centric Networking (ICN) architecture, which we call ICN-IoT [1] has been proposed.  ICN-IoT leverages the salient features of ICN, and thus provides seamless device-to-device (D2D) communication, mobility support, scalability, and efficient content and service delivery. Furthermore, in order to guarantee the real diffusion of ICN-IoT architecture it is fundamental to deal with self-configuring features such as device onboarinding and discovery, service discovery, scalability, security and privacy requirements, content dissemmination since the IoT system will comprise of diverse applications with heterogenous requirements including connectivity, resource constraints and mobility.  Towards this, the draft elaborates on a set of middleware functions to enable large operation of an ICN-IoT deployment.  This draft begins by motivating the need for an unified ICN-IoT architecture to connect heterogeneous IoT systems.  We then propose an ICN-IoT system architecture and middleware components which includes device/network-service discovery, naming service, IoT service discovery, data discovery, user registration, and content delivery.  For all of these components, discussions for secure solutions are offered.  We also provide discussions on inter- connecting heterogeneous ICN-IoT domains.</t></abstract>
