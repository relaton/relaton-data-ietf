<abstract><t>In some IPv6/IPv4 translation scenarios it is necessary for an IPv6 host to know the IPv6 prefix used by its address family translator. In some of the IPv6/IPv4 translation proposals, the prefix is not fixed; that is, the prefix is chosen by the network operator.  This specification provides several methods to learn the prefix and its length.</t></abstract>
