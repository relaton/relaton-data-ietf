<abstract><t>This document presents two sets of paths for an address prefix that can be advertised by a BGP route reflector or confederation ASBR to eliminate the MED-induced route oscillations in a network.  The first set involves all the available paths, and would achieve the same routing consistency as the full IBGP mesh.  The second set, which is a subset of the first one, involves the neighbor-AS based Group Best Paths, and would be sufficient to eliminate the MED-induced route oscillations (subject to certain commonly adopted topological constrains).</t></abstract>
