<abstract><t>This memo describes the Secure Real-Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP), an endpoint-to-endpoint communication protocol designed to securely transport parallel flows of real-time video, audio, and data messages, as well as bulk data, over IP networks.  RTMFP has features making it effective for peer-to-peer (P2P) as well as client-server communications, even when Network Address Translators (NATs) are used.</t></abstract>
