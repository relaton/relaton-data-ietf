<abstract><t>For location-based applications, such as emergency calling or roadside assistance, the identity of the requestor is less important than accurate and trustworthy location information.  A number of protocols are available to supply end systems with either civic or geodetic information.  For some applications it is an important requirement that location information has not been modified in transit or by the end point itself.  This document investigates different threats, the adversary model, and outlines three possible solutions.  The document concludes with a suggestion on how to move forward.</t></abstract>
