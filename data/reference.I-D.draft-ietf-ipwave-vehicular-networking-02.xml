<abstract><t>This document discusses use cases, survey, and problem statement on IP-based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main topics of vehicular networking are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I), and infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) networking. First, this document surveys use cases using V2V and V2I networking. Second, this document deals with some critical aspects in vehicular networking, such as vehicular network architectures, standardization activities, IP address autoconfiguration, routing, mobility management, DNS naming service, service discovery, and security and privacy.  For each aspect, this document discusses problem statement to analyze the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques and requirements in IP-based vehicular networking.  Finally, this document articulates discussions including the summary and analysis of vehicular networking aspects and raises deployment issues.</t></abstract>
