<abstract><t>IETF CCAMP WG has defined a set of extensions to OSPFv2 to support ASON routing requirements in [RFC5787].  No extensions were defined for bandwidth advertisement as the Interface Switching Capability Descriptor may optionally be included for each layer of a multi-layer link [RFC4202].  However, for some types SONET/SDH links there can be several data plane layers supported by a single link, and as a result a need to carry several copies of the ISCD.  This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for SONET/SDH that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD sub-TLV and has been designed to be consistent with advertisement of bandwidth for OTN.</t></abstract>
