  <abstract><t>MAC-independent Link Aggregation capability and general information relevant to specific MAC types are defined in this standard. Link Aggregation allows parallel full-duplex point-to-point links to be used as if they were a single link and also supports the use of multiple links as a resilient load sharing interconnect between multiple nodes in two separately administered networks.</t>
