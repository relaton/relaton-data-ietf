<abstract><t>This document outlines the functionality required for a P2P streaming Tracker Protocol, including functional entities and architecture, and components.  Additionally, it provides two strawman proposals for encoding the tracker information -- first using a binary protocol, and using an HTTP/XML based encoding.  This Tracker protocol is an application-level protocol for peers to register, publish/request content and provide peer status to Trackers.  It is also used by trackers to provide peer lists to peers, as well as to send control/management messages to and communicate with other trackers.  The PPSP tracker protocol can serve live media and VoD, as well as file sharing applications.</t></abstract>
