<abstract><t>The call completion features allow the calling user of a failed call to be notified when the called user becomes available to receive a call.  For the realization of a basic solution without queueing call- completion requests, this document references the usage of the the dialog event package [RFC4235] as described as 'automatic redial' in [RFC5359].  For the realization of a more comprehensive solution with queueing call-completion requests, this document introduces an architecture for implementing these features in the Session Initiation Protocol: "Call completion" implementations associated with the caller's and callee's endpoints cooperate to place the caller's request for call completion into a queue at the callee's endpoint, and, when a caller's request is ready to be serviced, re-attempt the original, failed call.  The deployment of a certain SIP call-completion solution is also dependent on the needed level of interoperability with existing call- completion solutions in other networks.</t></abstract>
