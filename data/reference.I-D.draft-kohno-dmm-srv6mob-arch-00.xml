<abstract><t>Layer separation is a powerful concept in system architecture.  In the area of mobility, by separating GTP-U that is the overlay tunnel, and the IP transport network that is the underlay, the operation of the mobile network and the transport network can be separated, allowing them to evolve independently.  However, evolving individually at each layer promotes local optimization and may result in non-optimal solutions overall in the long run.  When a drastic architectural transition is required, for example, in the 5G era where various SLAs and completely new data intensive services are assumed, it is necessary to reconsider the architecture holistically, rather than from the viewpoint of individual layer.  One important value propositions of SRv6 mobile user plane is the possible optimization across the existing multiple layers.  This document discusses the architectural implications of applying SRv6 mobile user plane, especially regarding the possible optimization of existing layers.  Then it takes 5G requirements and use cases as an example, and describes how these use cases are simply and effectively realized with the inter-layer optimization capability of SRv6 mobile user plane.  Thus it show that SRv6 mobile use plane is a right architectural choice for the 5G era.</t></abstract>
