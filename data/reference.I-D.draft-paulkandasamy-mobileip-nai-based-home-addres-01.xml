<abstract><t>With the introduction of NAIs for identifying Mobile Nodes, RFC 2794 also enabled the Home Agents to be able to assign IP addresses to Mobile Nodes during their initial registration. Though the concept of NAI-based home address assignment is referenced in both RFC 2794 and RFC 3344, a comprehensive procedure for achieving such a NAI-based home address assignment has not been outlined. More particularly, the Home Agent and Mobile Node behaviors including the error recovery mechanisms for various scenarios related to NAI- based home address assignment have not yet been specified. This document specifies a procedure that the Mobile IP entities should follow in order to facilitate NAI-based home address assignment under various circumstances.</t></abstract>
