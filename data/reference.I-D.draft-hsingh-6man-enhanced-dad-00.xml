<abstract><t>Appendix A of [RFC4862] discusses Loopback Suppression and Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).  However, [RFC4862] does not settle on one specific automated means to detect Loopback of Neighbor Discovery (ND) [RFC4861] messages used by DAD.  Several service provider communities have expressed a need for automated detection of looped backed ND messages used by DAD.  This document outlines an algorithm to automate detection of looped back IPv6 ND messages.  Further, for certain access networks the document automates resolving a specific duplicate address conflict.</t></abstract>
