<abstract><t>In packet transport networks, there are requirements where reverse unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same path as its forward unidirectional LSP.  This document describes how RSVP Extended ASSOCIATION Object can be used to bind two co-routed point-to-point unidirectional LSPs into an associated co-routed bidirectional LSP in single-sided provisioning case.  The RSVP REVERSE_LSP Object is used to enable an endpoint to trigger creation of the reverse LSP along the same path as the forward LSP. Fast-reroute procedures to ensure that the traffic flows on the co-routed path after a failure event are also described.</t></abstract>
