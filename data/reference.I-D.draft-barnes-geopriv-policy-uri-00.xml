<abstract><t>Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning an Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's location.  However, these protocols lack a mechnism for the htarget host to inspect or set the privacy rules that are applied to the URIs they distribute.  This document extends the current location configuration protocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules that are applied to a URI, so that the host can view or set these rules.</t></abstract>
