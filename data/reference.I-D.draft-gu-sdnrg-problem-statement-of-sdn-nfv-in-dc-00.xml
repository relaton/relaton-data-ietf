<abstract><t>With the development of cloud computing technology, cloud datacenters have been influenced.  Co-deployment of SDN and NFV technology shows its distinct advantages of vitalizing network resources in providing VPC services and SFC services.In order to deploy SDN and NFV in cloud datacenters, a resolution test has been conducted.  According to the resolution test, SDN and NFV technology has been mature already for the commercial deployment in operators' network.  However, there are some key problems on network architecture, virtualized platform, standard interfaces and so on to be working out in practical practice.</t></abstract>
