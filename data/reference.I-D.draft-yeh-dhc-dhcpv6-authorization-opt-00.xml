<abstract><t>The DHCPv6 authorization option provides a communication mechanism between relay agent and the server.  This mechanism can help the centralized DHCPv6 server to select the right configuration for the client based on the authorization information got from the centralized RADIUS server which is not located at the same place of DHCPv6 server in the case when the NAS works as DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS client simultaneously.</t></abstract>
