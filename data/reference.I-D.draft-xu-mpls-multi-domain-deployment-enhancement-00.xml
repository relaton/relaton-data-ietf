<abstract><t>MPLS as a mature technology is increasingly deployed in large-scale networks which consists of multiple domains (e.g., IGP areas/levels and even Autonomous Systems). To scale such multi-domain MPLS deployment, the concept of hierarchical LSPs is usually resorted. This document describes an enhancement to such hierarchical multi- domain MPLS deployment architecture that could further improve the scalability of multi-domain MPLS deployment.</t></abstract>
