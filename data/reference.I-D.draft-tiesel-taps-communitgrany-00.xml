<abstract><t>This document provides an abstract framework to reason about the composition of multi-path aware systems in a protocol-independent fashion.  It discusses basic mechanisms that are used in multi-path systems and their applicability to different granularities of communication units.  This document is targeted as consideration basis for automation of destination, path and transport protocol selection within the transport layer.</t></abstract>
