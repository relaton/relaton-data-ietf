<abstract><t>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as they define and impact policies on call routing, rendezvous, and other call features. However, there is currently no standard mechanism by which a proxy can define or influence policies on sessions such as the codecs or media types to be used. This document specifies a framework for SIP session policies that provides this capability to proxies. It defines a model, an overall architecture and the protocol components for session policies.</t></abstract>
