<abstract><t>Most efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have been focused on environments covering Circuit oriented LSPs (Sonet/SDH, OTH, etc.). There is minimal documentation on GMPLS support of Layer-2 Label Switched Paths (L2 LSPs), e.g. native Ethernet LSPs, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) LSPs and Frame Relay (FR) LSPs. This document details GMPLS capabilities for supporting L2 LSPs in several network environments including overlays. As such, it provides a reference detailing the applicability of GMPLS for Layer- 2 switching environments in support of various deployment scenarios, including the integrated (e.g. multi LSP-region networks), the augmented/peer and the overlay model (e.g. Generalized VPN (GVPN) and user-network interfaces (GMPLS UNI)).</t></abstract>
