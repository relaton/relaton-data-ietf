<abstract><t>The objective of this proposal is to introduce a mobility support framework for information centric networking (ICN) that is capable of supporting dynamic mobility scenarios associated with both consumer and producer applications, in a mobile device connected to a wireless LAN or WAN point of attachment (PoA).  Due to rapidly evolving user trends that shift towards increased mobility and increased access to mobile content delivery (as both content producer and consumer), it is essential for an ICN architecture to offer active mobility support to end hosts, and present them with varying degrees of quality of experience.  We enable this through the use of a network-driven mobility support architecture, which operates in a distributed and anchorless manner, and relies on late-binding and in--band signaling with the use of forwarding labels.</t></abstract>
