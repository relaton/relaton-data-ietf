<abstract><t>The demand for streaming services is increasing because of the growing number of broadband users.  In particular, multicast services might become core network services, and additional demand is expected.  On the other hand, multicast operation is quite complex, and there are strict network quality requirements about packet loss and delay.  A measurement system using IPFIX/PSAMP helps to monitor multicast traffic behavior carefully.  However, some problems with IPFIX/PSAMP still remain when network operators try to introduce the measurement system.  This document describes issues that the multicast traffic measurement system might encounter.  The results are intended to be used to define multicast handling by IPFIX/PSAMP metering devices more clearly.</t></abstract>
