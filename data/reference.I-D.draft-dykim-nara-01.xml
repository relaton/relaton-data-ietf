<abstract><t>A network architecture based on recursive addressing is proposed. The Internet is modeled as a network of autonomous domains, each being a collection of nodes.  Each domain is named by a global address whereas each node by a local address.  Inter-domain routing depends solely on domain addresses while intra-domain routing on node addresses.  Routing based on node or domain addresses render inherent mobility as well as seamless multi-homing capability.  The model can recursively repeat itself both outwards and inwards in the network, enabling its applicability, for example, to inter-planetary as well as body area networks.</t></abstract>
