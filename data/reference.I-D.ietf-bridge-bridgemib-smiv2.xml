<abstract><t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets. In particular it defines objects for managing MAC bridges based on the IEEE 802.1D-1998 standard between Local Area Network (LAN) segments. Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging. Provisions are also made so that these objects apply to bridges The MIB module presented in this memo is a translation of the BRIDGE-MIB defined in RFC 1493 to the SMIv2 syntax.</t></abstract>
