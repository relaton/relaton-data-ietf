<abstract><t>This document defines procedures for fast reroute protection of Point-To-MultiPoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE-LSP) in MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks, based upon Point-To-MultiPoint bypass tunnels. The motivation for using P2MP bypass tunnels is to avoid potentially expensive data duplication along the backup path that could occur if point-to-point bypass tunnels where used, i.e. to optimize the bandwidth usage, during fast reroute protection of a link or a node. During link or node failure the traffic carried onto a protected P2MP TE-LSP is tunnelled within one or several P2MP bypass tunnels towards a set of Merge Points. To avoid data duplication backup labels (i.e. inner labels) are assigned by the Point of Local Repair (PLR) following the RSVP-TE upstream label assignment procedure.</t></abstract>
