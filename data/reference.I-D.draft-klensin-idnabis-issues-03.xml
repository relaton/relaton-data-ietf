<abstract><t>A recent IAB report identified issues that have been raised with Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs). Some of these issues require tuning of the existing protocols and the tables on which they depend. Based on intensive discussion by an informal design team, this document provides an overview some of the proposals that are being made, provides explanatory material for them and then further explains some of the issues that have been encountered.</t></abstract>
