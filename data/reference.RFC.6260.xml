<abstract><t>This document describes a convention by which Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Bundle Protocol (BP) &quot;convergence-layer&quot; adapters may represent endpoint identifiers in a compressed form within the primary blocks of bundles, provided those endpoint identifiers conform to the structure prescribed by this convention.</t><t>Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) compression is a convergence-layer adaptation.  It is opaque to bundle processing. Therefore, it has no impact on the interoperability of different Bundle Protocol implementations, but instead affects only the interoperability of different convergence-layer adaptation implementations.</t><t>This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.  This document defines an Experimental  Protocol for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
