<abstract><t>This document describes a method to generate negative answers from NSEC records for the special case of the DNS root.  This improves performance; the resolver can answer immediatly, and does not need to query the root.  It also cuts down on the so-called "junk" queries.  [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings, etc.  They will be removed before publication.]  [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop.  The most recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available here.  The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests ]</t></abstract>
