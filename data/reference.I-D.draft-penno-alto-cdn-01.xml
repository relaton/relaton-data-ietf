<abstract><t>Networking applications can request through the ALTO protocol information about the underlying network topology from the ISP or Content Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point of view.  In other words, what a Provider prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.  The ALTO Service provides information such as preferences of network resources with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance.  A main use case of the ALTO Service is its integration with of Content Delivery Networks (CDN).  In this document we describe the deployment scenarios and considerations for a ALTO Service in the case of CDNs.</t></abstract>
