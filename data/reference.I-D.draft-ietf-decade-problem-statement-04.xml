<abstract><t>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the Internet today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks.  In P2P applications, one technique for reducing the transit and uplink P2P traffic is to introduce storage capabilities within the network (the download traffic may increase because the in- network storage is likely much better connected).  Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web caches) provide such storage, but they are complex (due to explicitly supporting individual P2P application protocols and cache refreshing mechanisms) and they do not have the feature to allow users to manage access to content in the cache.  For example, Content Providers cannot easily control cache access and resource usage policies to satisfy their own requirements.  In this document, a content provider is also the user of in-network storage.  This document discusses the introduction of in-network storage for P2P applications, and shows the need for a standard protocol for accessing this storage.  It can also be used by other applications with similar requirements.</t></abstract>
