<abstract><t>The Internet is evolving to become a more ubiquitous network, driven by the low prices of wireless routers and access points and by the users' requirements of connectivity anytime and anywhere. For that reason, a cloud of nodes connected by wireless technology is being created at the edge of the Internet. This cloud is called a MANEMO Fringe Stub (MFS). It is expected that networking in the MFS will be highly unmanaged and ad-hoc, but at the same time will need to offer excellent service availability. The NEMO Basic Support protocol could be used to provide global reachability for a mobile access network within the MFS and the Tree-Discovery mechanism could be used to avoid the formation of loops in this highly unmanaged structure. Since Internet connectivity in mobile scenarios can be costly, limited or unavailable, there is a need to enable local routing between the Mobile Routers within a portion of the MFS. This form of local routing is useful for Route Optimization (RO) between Mobile Routers that are communicating directly in a portion of the MFS. NINA is the second of a 2-passes routing protocol; a first pass, Tree Discovery, builds a loop-less structure -a tree-, and the second pass, NINA, exposes the Mobile Network Prefixes (MNPs) up the tree. The protocol operates as a multi-hop extension of Neighbor Discovery (ND), to populate TD-based trees with prefixes, and establish routes towards the MNPs down the tree, from the root-MR towards the MR that owns the prefix, whereas the default route is oriented towards the root-MR. The NINA protocol introduces a new option in the ND Neighbor Advertisement (NA), the Network In Node Option (NINO). An NA with NINO(s) is called a NINA (Network In Node Advertisement). NINA is designed for a hierarchical model where an embedded network is abstracted as a Host for the upper level of network abstraction. With NINA, a Mobile Router presents its sub-tree to its parent as an embedded network and hides the inner topology and movements.</t></abstract>
