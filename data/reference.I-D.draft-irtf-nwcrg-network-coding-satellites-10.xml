<abstract><t>This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  It conforms to the directions found in the NWCRG taxonomy [RFC8406].  Thus, the scope of the document is network coding as a linear combination of packets in and above the network layer.  Physical and MAC layer coding are beyond the scope of the document.  The draft focuses on a multi-gateway satellite system and identifies the use-cases where network coding provides significant performance improvements.  The objective is to contribute to a larger deployment of network coding techniques in SATCOM to complement already implemented loss recovery mechanisms. The draft also identifies open research issues related to the deployment of network coding in SATCOM systems.</t></abstract>
