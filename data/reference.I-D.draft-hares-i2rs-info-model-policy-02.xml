<abstract><t>This document introduces an information model for network policies. This model operates as policy model that can be linked to other information model such as the I2RS RIB information model.  Some applications that utilize the services of I2RS client may require specific set of data in response to network events or conditions based on pre-established rules.  In order to reduce the data flow through the network, the I2RS client needs to signal the I2RS agent to filter some of the collected data or events prior to transmission, or group the data prior to transmission to the i2rs client.  This functionality is necessary to meet the requirements i2rs enabled services which include service-layer routing improvements, and control of traffic flows and exit points.  The information model is based on extensible information model for representing policies, for example, the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) (RFC3060), and an extension to this model to address the need for QoS management, called the Quality of Service (QoS) Policy Information Model (QPIM)(RFC3644) and policy based routing.</t></abstract>
