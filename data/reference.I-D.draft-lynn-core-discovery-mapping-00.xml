<abstract><t>Resource and service discovery are complimentary.  Resource discovery provides fine-grained detail about the content of a server, while service discovery can provide a scable method to locate servers in large networks.  This document defines a method for mapping between CoRE Link-Format attributes and DNS-Based Service Discovery fields so the two methods can be jointly employed in large scale networks.</t></abstract>
