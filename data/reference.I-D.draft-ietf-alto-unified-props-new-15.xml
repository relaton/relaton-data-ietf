<abstract><t>This document extends the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol by generalizing the concept of "endpoint properties" to generic types of entities, and by presenting those properties as maps, similar to the network and cost maps in the base ALTO protocol. The protocol is extended in two major directions.  First, from endpoints restricted to IP addresses to entities covering a wider and extensible set of objects; second, from properties on specific endpoints to entire entity property maps.  These extensions introduce additional features allowing entities and property values to be specific to a given information resource.  This is made possible by a generic and flexible design of entity and property types.</t></abstract>
