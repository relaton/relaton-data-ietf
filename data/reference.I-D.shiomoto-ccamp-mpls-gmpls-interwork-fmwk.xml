<abstract><t>The migration from Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) to Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) is the process of evolving an MPLS traffic engineered (TE) control plane to a GMPLS control plane. An appropriate migration strategy can be selected based on various factors including the service provider's network deployment plan, customer demand, available network equipment implementation, operational policy, etc. In the course of migration, several interworking cases may exist where MPLS and GMPLS devices or networks must coexist. During the migration process, standard interworking functions are needed to allow graceful deployment of GMPLS technologies while keeping existing IP/MPLS networks unaffected. Since GMPLS signaling and routing protocols are different from the MPLS control protocols, in order for MPLS and GMPLS to interwork, we need mechanisms to compensate for the differences between MPLS and GMPLS. This document provides a landscape of techniques, practices and an overview of interworking between MPLS and GMPLS in support of IP/MPLS to GMPLS migration, which is also beneficial for graceful deployment of GMPLS technologies into existing IP/MPLS networks. We discuss issues, models, migration scenarios, operation, and requirements.</t></abstract>
