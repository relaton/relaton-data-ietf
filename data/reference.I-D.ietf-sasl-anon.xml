<abstract><t>It is common practice on the Internet to permit anonymous access to various services. Traditionally, this has been done with a plain text password mechanism using 'anonymous' as the user name and optional trace information, such as an email address, as the password. As plaintext login commands are not permitted in new IETF protocols, a new way to provide anonymous login is needed within the context of the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) framework.</t></abstract>
