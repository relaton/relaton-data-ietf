<abstract><t>This memo specifies a RESTful interface for local deployments to demonstrate proof of possession to a device or to a manufacturer authorized signing authority (MASA).  This covers the case where a MASA would not otherwise have knowledge of where a device is deployed, or when a MASA may not be required.  Such knowledge is important to onboard certain classes of devices, such as those on IEEE 802.11 networks.</t></abstract>
