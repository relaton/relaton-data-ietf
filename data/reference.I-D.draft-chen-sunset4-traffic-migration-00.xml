<abstract><t>In order to make a graceful IPv4 sunset, this memo described a method helping traffic migration to IPv6.  With the growth of IPv6 traffic, operators could safely turn off IPv4 and evolve to IPv6-only network. In order to achieve the goal, new traffic-migration options have been proposed in DHCPv6 and PCP.  IPv6 traffic steering could be performed using those configurations.</t></abstract>
