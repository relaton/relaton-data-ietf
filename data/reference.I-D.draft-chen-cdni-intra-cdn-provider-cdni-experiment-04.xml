<abstract><t>In [RFC6770], the Inter-Affiliates CDN Interconnection use case is described.  In this scenario, a large CDN Provider may have several autonomous or semi-autonomous subsidiaries that each operates on their own CDN.  The CDN Provider needs to make these down-stream CDNs interoperate to provide a consistent service to its customers on the whole collective footprint.
