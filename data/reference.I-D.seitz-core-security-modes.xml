<abstract><t>The CoAP draft defines how to use DTLS as security mechanism.  In order to establish which nodes are trusted to initiate a DTLS session with a device, the following security modes are defined: NoSec, PreSharedKey, RawPublicKey, and Certificate.  These modes require either to provision a list of keys of trusted clients, or to handle heavyweight certificates.  This memo proposes two intermediate security modes involving a trusted third party that are very similar to PreSharedKey and RawPublicKey respectively, but which do not require out-of-band provisioning of client keys to the device.</t></abstract>
