<abstract><t>This document describes the conventions for using the message digest algorithms SHA-224, as defined in [RFC3874], and SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, as defined in [SHA2], with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC3852]. It also describes the conventions for using these algorithms with CMS and the DSA, RSA, and ECDSA signature algorithms. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t></abstract>
