<abstract><t>This draft defines an architecture, and related protocols, for performing dynamic Mobile IPv6 authorization and configuration relying on a AAA infrastructure. The necessary interaction between the AAA server of the home provider and the mobile node is realized using EAP, exploiting the capability of some EAP methods to convey generic information items together with authentication data. This approach has the advantage that the access equipment acts as a simple pass-through for EAP messages and therefore does not play any active role in the Mobile IPv6 negotiation procedure, which makes the solution easier to deploy and maintain.</t></abstract>
