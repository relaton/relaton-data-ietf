<abstract><t>Mobile IPv6 has relied on IPsec and IKE/v2 for securing the signaling and user traffic.  A single security mechanism for Mobile IPv6 does not adequately address various deployment scenarios.  The one-size- fits-all security approach is ill suited for Mobile IPv6.  Multiple alternatives to securing signaling and user traffic have been proposed and are being considered for standardization.  When multiple security protocols coexist for providing security for mobile IPv6 nodes, there is a need to negotiate the choice of protocol between a mobile node and home agent apriori.  This document proposes a method for negotiation the security protocol to be used betewen mobile IPv6 nodes.</t></abstract>
