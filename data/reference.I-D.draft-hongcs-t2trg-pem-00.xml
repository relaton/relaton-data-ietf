<abstract><t>Renewable energy enabled sustainable energy management ensures a high degree of reliability in order to fulfill the energy demand of a smart city. In such case, renewable energy generation is random over time and also energy consumption of smart city usersâ is nondeterministic in nature. Therefore, to ensure sustainable energy management for smart city, a proactive energy management scheme should be integrated into smart city network. In which, edge node should be considered as local computational unit for each energy user and microgrid controller should be played the role of energy management decision aggregator. As a result, proactive energy management scheme not only overcomes the challenges of renewable energy-aware demand scheduling but also establishes a strong relationship for both energy generation and consumption over time. Therefore, a distributed mechanism is considered, where the edge node for executing local agent to determine an individual usersâ policy with respect to energy consumption and renewable energy generation (usersâ own sources). On the other hand, microgrid controller determines meta-policy through a meta-agent with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Since a meta-agent accepts local policy as an input with historical observations, which ensures fast and efficient execution of proactive energy management for the smart city.</t></abstract>
