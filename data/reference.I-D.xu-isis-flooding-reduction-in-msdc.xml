<abstract><t>IS-IS is commonly used as an underlay routing protocol for MSDC (Massively Scalable Data Center) networks.  For a given IS-IS router within the CLOS topology, it would receive multiple copies of exactly the same LSP from multiple IS-IS neighbors.  In addition, two IS-IS neighbors may send each other the same LSP simultaneously.  The unneccessary link-state information flooding wastes the precious process resource of IS-IS routers greatly due to the fact that there are too many IS-IS neighbors for each IS-IS router within the CLOS topology.  This document proposes some extensions to IS-IS so as to reduce the IS-IS flooding within MSDC networks greatly.  The reduction of the IS-IS flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC networks.</t></abstract>
