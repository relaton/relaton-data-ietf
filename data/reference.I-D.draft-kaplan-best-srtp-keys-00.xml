<abstract><t>This document defines an opportunistic SRTP key exchange mechanism to get the best-case SRTP keys, using a slightly modified version of Security Descriptions model [secdes], followed by a second-stage media-plane key exchange based on [XXX]. There are several distinct advantages to this mechanism over others; these benefits are documented herein. The main goal of this draft is to put forth a strawman proposal to perform a 2-stage key-exchange, first via a [secdes] style mechanism, then through a media-plane mechanism.</t></abstract>
