<abstract><t>There is an increased interest of simple and scalable resource provisioning solution for Diffserv network. The Load Control PCN (LC-PCN) addresses the following issues: o Admission control for real time data flows in stateless Diffserv Domains o Flow termination: Termination of flows in case of exceptional events, such as severe congestion after re-routing. Admission control in a Diffserv stateless domain is a combination of: o Probing, whereby a probe packet is sent along the forwarding path in a network to determine whether a flow can be admitted based upon the current congestion state of the network o Admission control based on data marking, whereby in congestion situations the data packets are marked to notify the PCN-egress- node that a congestion occurred on a particular PCN-ingress-node to PCN-egress-node path. The scheme provides the capability of controlling the traffic load in the network without requiring signaling or any per-flow processing in the PCN-interior-nodes. The complexity of Load Control is kept to a minimum to make implementation simple.</t></abstract>
