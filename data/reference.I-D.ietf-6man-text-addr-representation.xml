<abstract><t>As IPv6 deployment increases there will be a dramatic increase in the need to use IPv6 addresses in text.  While the IPv6 address architecture in RFC 4291 section 2.2 describes a flexible model for text representation of an IPv6 address this flexibility has been causing problems for operators, system engineers, and users.  This document defines a canonical textual representation format.  It does not define a format for internal storage, such as within an application or database.  It is expected that the canonical format is followed by humans and systems when representing IPv6 addresses as text, but all implementations must accept and be able to handle any legitimate RFC 4291 format.</t></abstract>
