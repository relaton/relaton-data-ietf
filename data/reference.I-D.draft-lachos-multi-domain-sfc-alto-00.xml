<abstract><t>Currently, Service Function Chaining (SFC) that span domains with different technology, administration or ownership are being defined by the SFC WG.  This document focuses on how the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol can be used to advertise and discover abstract topology, resource and service information from different domains, and then compute inter-domain service function paths.  Another important concern of this draft is to initiate a discussion (ALTO, SFC as well as other WGs) regarding if, how, and under what conditions ALTO can be useful to improve the multi-domain SFC process.</t></abstract>
