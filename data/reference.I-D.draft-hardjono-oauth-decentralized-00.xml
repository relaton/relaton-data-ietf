<abstract><t>This document proposes an alternative service architecture for user- centric control of the sharing of resources, such as personal data, using the decentralized peer-to-peer computing paradigm.  The term 'control' is used here to denote the full capacity of the user to freely select (i) the entities with whom to share resources (e.g. data), and (ii) the entities which provide services implementing user-controlled resource sharing.  The peer-to-peer service architecture uses a set of computing nodes called OAuth2.0 Nodes (ON) that are part of a peer-to-peer network as the basis for the decentralized service architecture.  Each OAuth2.0 Nodes is assumed to have the capability to provide AS-services, RS-services and Client-services.</t></abstract>
