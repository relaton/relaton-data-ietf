  <abstract><t>As the demand and supply for 3D technologies grows, the development of accurate quality-assessment techniques shall be used to develop the 3D display device and signal-processing engine industries. The underlying principles and statistical characteristics of 3D contents based on the human visual system (HVS) are described in this standard. In addition, a reliable 3D subjective assessment methodology that covers the characteristics of human perception, display mechanism, and the viewing environment is introduced in this standard.</t>
