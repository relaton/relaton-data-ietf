<abstract><t>This document analyzes security issues around implementation and  use of the Direct Data Placement Protocol (DDP) and Remote Direct  Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP).  It first defines an architectural  model for an RDMA Network Interface Card (RNIC), which can  implement DDP or RDMAP and DDP.  The document reviews various  attacks against the resources defined in the architectural model  and the countermeasures that can be used to protect the system. Attacks are grouped into those that can be mitigated by using secure communication channels across the network, attacks from Remote Peers, and attacks from Local Peers.  Attack categories include spoofing, tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
