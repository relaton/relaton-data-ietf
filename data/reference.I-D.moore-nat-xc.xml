<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism called NAT-XC (for NAT with Explicit Control) for translating between IPv4 and IPv6.  NAT-XC is distinguished from other IPv4/IPv6 translations schemes in that it separates the translation between IPv4 and IPv6 from the management of address bindings for such a translation; and is designed to allow applications to be explicitly aware of, and control, their address bindings.  NAT-XC can be used by both IPv4 clients wishing to communicate via IPv6, and IPv6 clients wishing to communicate via IPv4.  NAT-XC appears to be usable in a wide variety of scenarios requiring communication across IPv4/IPv6 boundaries.</t></abstract>
