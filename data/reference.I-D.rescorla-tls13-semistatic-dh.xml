<abstract><t>TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] specifies a signed Diffie-Hellman exchange modelled after SIGMA [SIGMA].  This design is suitable for endpoints whose certified credential is a signing key, which is the common situation for current TLS servers.  This document describes a mode of TLS 1.3 in which one or both endpoints have a certified DH key which is used to authenticate the exchange.</t></abstract>
