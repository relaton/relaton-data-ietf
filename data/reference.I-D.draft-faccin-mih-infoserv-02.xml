<abstract><t>Handover Information Services may be used to assist handovers between one network to another network or within a network, based on stored network knowledge. Information Services can be used to provide essential network related information e.g. topology and channel information which may allow a moving host to select an appropriate link-layer connection to make, amongst available networks, whether using the same technology or heterogeneous technologies.
