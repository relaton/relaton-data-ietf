<abstract><t>This document proposes a method of algorithmic load balancing for IPv6 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCPv6) traffic.  It enables multiple, cooperating servers to decide which one should service a client, without necessarily exchanging any information between the servers.  The server selection is based on the servers hashing client DHCP Unique Identifiers (DUIDs) when multiple DHCPv6 servers are available to service DHCPv6 clients.  The proposed technique provides for efficient server selection when multiple DHCPv6 servers offer services on a network without requiring any changes to existing DHCPv6 clients.  This algorithm is an extension of an already defined and proven algorithm used for DHCPv4, as described in RFC 3074.</t></abstract>
