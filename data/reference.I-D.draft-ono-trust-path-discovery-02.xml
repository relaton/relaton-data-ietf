<abstract><t>Chained or transitive trust can be used to determine whether incoming communication is likely to be desirable or not. We can build a chained trust relationship by introducing friends to our friends, for example. We propose mechanisms for discovering trust paths and binary responsive trustworthiness. The trust paths are based on a chain of trust relationships between users, a user and a domain, and domains. We apply this model to establishing relatively low-value trust suitable for deciding whether to accept communication requests such as emails, calls, or instant messages from strangers.</t></abstract>
