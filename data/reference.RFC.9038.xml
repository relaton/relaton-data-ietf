<abstract><t>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), as defined in RFC 5730, includes a method for the client and server to determine the objects to be managed during a session and the object extensions to be used during a session.  The services are identified using namespace URIs, and an &quot;unhandled namespace&quot; is one that is associated with a service not supported by the client. This document defines an operational practice that enables the server to return information associated with unhandled namespace URIs and that maintains compliance with the negotiated services defined in RFC 5730.</t></abstract>
