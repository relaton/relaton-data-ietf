<abstract><t>A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide connectivity services for a client-layer network to carry the client traffic transparently across the server-layer network resources.  A transport network can be constructed from equipments utilizing any of a number of different transport technologies such as the evolving Optical Transport Networks (OTN) or packet transport as provided by the MPLS-Transport Profile (MPLS-TP).  This draft describes a YANG data model to describe the topologies of an Optical Transport Network (OTN).  It is independent of control plane protocols and captures topological and resource related information pertaining to OTN.  This model enables clients, which interact with a transport domain controller via a REST interface, for OTN topology related operations such as obtaining the relevant topology resource information.</t></abstract>
