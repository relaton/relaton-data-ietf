<abstract><t>This document is one of the companion documents which describes the infrastructure layer security baseline YANG output for network infrastructure devices.  The infrastructure layer security baseline includes all the fundamental security capabilities/functions about the device itself, which may also be provided by the device to the upper layer applications as a secure environment.  In this particular document, the integrity measurement, cryptography security, secure key management, and secure certificate management are summarized to generate the data model.</t></abstract>
