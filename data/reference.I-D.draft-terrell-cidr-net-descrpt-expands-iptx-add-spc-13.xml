<abstract><t>This document, which Obsoletes RFC 2373, RFC 1517, RFC 1518, RFC 1519, and IEEE Specification 1541-2002 (Re-defining the Electromagnetic Spectrum and the 'SI Units' as a Base 2 Exponential Binary Conversion), provides the final clarification of the conclusions that redefines the 'CIDR' notation as the 'Network Descriptor', and proves that the IP Address Pool Total for the IPtX Specification is greater than IPv6. And more importantly, because these conclusions reveal the actual design of the Binary Communication System, the Revolutionary impact sustained, is an upheaval affecting the entire field of Computer Science. In other words, IPtX is a more powerful and cost effective IP Addressing Specification, and when using the 'IPtX-MX Protocol' {'2"X : 1'; the Compression Ratio for "The Intelligent Quantum Tunneling Worm Protocol" - The Design of the 'Internet Protocol telecommunications Xchange Specification'}, the interface of the "Front-End" can mimic or simulate a 32 Bit-Mapped IP Address. And this, in conjunction with the IPv4 IP Addressing Overlay, provides a 100% Backward Compatibility with the IPv4 Specification, in the Backbone environment approaching an unlimited size 'Bit-Map' Address Space.</t></abstract>
