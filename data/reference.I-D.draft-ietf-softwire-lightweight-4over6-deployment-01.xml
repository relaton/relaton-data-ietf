<abstract><t>Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism for providing IPv4 services to clients connected to a single-stack IPv6 network.  The architecture is similar to DS-Lite, but the network address translation function is relocated from the tunnel concentrator to the tunnel client, hence reducing the amount of state which must be maintained in the concentrator to a per-customer level.  This document discusses the applicability, describes various deployment models and provides deployment considerations for Lightweight 4over6.</t></abstract>
