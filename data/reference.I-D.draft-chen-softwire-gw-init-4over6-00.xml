<abstract><t>Gateway-Initiated 4over6 (GI-4over6) is a variant of 4over6 mechanisms which include Public 4over6 ([I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6]) and Lightweight 4over6 ([I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite]), and it's designed to satisfy the certain tunnel-based access scenario.  The GI-4over6 extends the On-Link Client Relay Agent (LCRA) that is defined in [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6] and thus makes it enabled to help gateway device perform 4over6 CE function described in [I-D.ietf-softwire-public-4over6], and lwB4 function described in [I-D.cui-softwire-b4-translated-ds-lite], while the public IPv4 addresses (and available ports) are assigned to the end hosts that behind the gateway device.</t></abstract>
