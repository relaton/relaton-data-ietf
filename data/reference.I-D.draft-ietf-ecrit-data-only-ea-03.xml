<abstract><t>RFC 6443 'Framework for Emergency Calling Using Internet Multimedia' describes how devices use the Internet to place emergency calls and how Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) can handle Internet multimedia emergency calls natively.  The exchange of multimedia traffic typically involves a SIP session establishment starting with a SIP INVITE that negotiates various parameters for that session.  In some cases, however, the transmission of application data is everything that is needed.  Examples of such environments include a temperature sensors issuing alerts, or vehicles sending crash data. Often these alerts are conveyed as one-shot data transmissions and in some rare cases they may require a session to be established.  These type of interactions are called 'data-only emergency calls'.</t></abstract>
