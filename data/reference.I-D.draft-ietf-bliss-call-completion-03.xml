<abstract><t>The features "call completion on busy subscriber" and "call completion on no reply" allow the calling party of a failed call to be notified when the called party becomes available to receive a call.  This document describes an architecture for implementing these features in the Session Initiation Protocol: "Call completion" implementations at the caller's and callee's endpoints cooperate to place the caller's request for call completion into a queue at the callee's endpoint, and, when a caller's request is ready to be serviced, re-attempt the original, failed call.</t></abstract>
