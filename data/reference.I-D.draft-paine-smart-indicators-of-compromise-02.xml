<abstract><t>Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are an important technique in attack defence (often called cyber defence).  This document outlines the different types of IoC, their associated benefits and limitations, and discusses their effective use.  It also contextualises the role of IoCs in defending against attacks through describing a recent case study.  This draft does not pre-suppose where IoCs can be found or should be detected - as they can be discovered and deployed in networks, endpoints or elsewhere - rather, engineers should be aware that they need to be detectable (either by endpoints, security appliances or network-based defences, or ideally all) to be effective.  The purpose of this draft is to document both the operational issues, but also the best practices associated with use of IoCs today.  This draft provides a foundation for proposals for new approaches to operational challenges in network security.</t></abstract>
