<abstract><t>Flow measurement techniques have been developed in order to cope with increasing bandwiths.  Flow measurement is currently being used as a popular method for monitoring large networks, e.g. at Internet Service Providers or multinational corporations, for accounting, management, and security purposes.  To construct the measurement system for such networks, the biggest challenge is scalability. Whereas packet sampling functions in current flow measurement solutions such as NetFlow/sFlow/IPFIX help to approach this issue, some problems still remain.  This document describes such open issues, which a flow-based measurement system might encounter in large-scale networks.  The results are intended to be used to define and to develop an IPFIX Mediator device.</t></abstract>
