<abstract><t>Several types of Carrier-Grade-NATs (CGNs) have been proposed to simplify IPv4/IPv6 transition of the edge network by integrating tunnels and NAT. A very common scenario is that many users set up softwires (i.e. tunnels) to a softwire concentrator for public or private access services. In order to establish softwires successfully, a new mechanism is required to enable users in the edge network to discover the information of the concentrator. This document describes how a host or CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) discovers the remote softwire concentrator or CGN in a hub and spoke network using DHCP. Based on two new Softwire Concentrator or CGN Discovery DHCP Options, proposed in the document, a user can obtain softwire concentrator or CGN information and then set up a tunnel to the softwire concentrator or CGN.</t></abstract>
