<abstract><t>Ethernet VLANs are quite commonly used in enterprise networks for the purposes of traffic segregation.  This document describes how such VLANs can be readily used to deploy IPv6 networking in an enterprise, which focuses on the scenario of early deployment prior to availability of IPv6-capable switch-router equipment.  In this method, IPv6 may be routed in parallel with the existing IPv4 in the enterprise and delivered at Layer 2 via VLAN technology.  The IPv6 connectivity to the enterprise may or may not enter the site via the same physical link.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
