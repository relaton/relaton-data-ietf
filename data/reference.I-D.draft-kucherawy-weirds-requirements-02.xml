<abstract><t>This document enumerates a base set of requirements that should be included in any system that provides registration information for Internet network entities, i.e., network assignments.  Some of these, in turn, will define requirements for registrars; this, however, is an issue outside of the scope of this document.  It is hoped that this work will influnce the development of requirements and specifications for domain name registries at some point in the future.</t></abstract>
