<abstract><t>In MPLS-TP architecture, LSP and PW provisioning can be done either by Control Plane (CP) or Management Plane (MP).  The MPLS-TP control plane must provide a mechanism for dynamic ownership transfer of the control of MPLS-TP transport paths from MP to CP and vice versa. [draft-bao-mpls-tp-path-transfer-reqs-00] defines requirement for MPLS-TP paths ownership transfer from MP to CP and vice versa.  This document provides a framework to allow the development of protocol extensions to support the MPLS-TP paths ownership transfer between MP and CP and vice versa.</t></abstract>
