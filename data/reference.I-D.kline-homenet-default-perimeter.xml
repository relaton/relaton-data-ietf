<abstract><t>Automatic, simple identification of when traffic is crossing a perimeter is highly desirable for a variety of home network uses. This document describes how to use homenet routing protocol adjacencies as the primary signal of a common administrative domain (e.g. "the home").  Classification of interfaces et cetera as internal or external follow from this, as do various policy and implementation implications.  One fundamental implication is that the active definition of a home network's interior is no more secure than its policy for forming homenet routing protocol adjacencies.</t></abstract>
