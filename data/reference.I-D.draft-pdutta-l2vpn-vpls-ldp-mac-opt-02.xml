<abstract><t>[RFC4762] defines a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned in a VPLS Instance for faster convergence on topology change. The MAC addresses removed in this procedure also include the MAC addresses learned in a VSI that are not affected due to such topology change. This document defines an extension to LDP Address Withdraw Message with empty MAC List defined in [RFC4762], that enables a Provider Edge(PE) device receiving the message to remove only the MAC addresses that are affected and need to be relearned.</t></abstract>
