<abstract><t>Ethernet pseudowires are widely deployed to support packet transport of Ethernet services.  These services in-turn provide transport for a variety of client networks, e.g., IP and MPLS.  This document uses procedures defined in the existing IETF specifications of Ethernet pseudowires carried over MPLS networks.</t><t>Many of the requirements for the services provided by the mechanisms explained in this document are also recognized by the MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) design effort formed jointly by the IETF and ITU-T. The solution described here does not address all of the MPLS-TP requirements, but it provides a viable form of packet transport service using tools that are already available.</t><t>This document also serves as an indication that existing MPLS techniques form an appropriate basis for the design of a fully- featured packet transport solution addressing all of the requirements of MPLS-TP.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track  specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
