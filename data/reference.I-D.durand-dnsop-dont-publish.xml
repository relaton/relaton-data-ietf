<abstract><t>This document aims at restarting the discussion on what a site network administrator should publish in the global DNS and what they should not. The latest attempt was documented in a previous draft [4] was was ultimately an unsuccessful effort to clarify what to do with IPv4 private addresses RFC1918 [1] in the DNS. Since then, a number of similar issues coming from the IPv6 world have arisen and there is a sense that the situation needs to be clarified by a BCP document.</t></abstract>
