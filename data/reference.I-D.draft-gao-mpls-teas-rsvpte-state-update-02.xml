<abstract><t>RSVP-TE has the following advantages: source routing capability, and the ability to reserve resources hop by hop along the LSP path.</t><t> RSVP takes a &quot;soft state&quot; approach to managing the reservation state in routers and hosts. The use of Refresh messages to cover many possible failures has resulted in a number of operational problems.  One problem relates to scaling, another relates to the reliability and latency of RSVP Signaling.</t><t> This document describes a number of mechanisms that can be used to reduce processing overhead requirements of refresh messages. These extension present no backwards compatibility issues.</t></abstract>
