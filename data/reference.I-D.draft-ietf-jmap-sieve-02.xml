<abstract><t>This document specifies a data model for managing Sieve scripts on a server using JMAP.  Open Issues  o  Should we introduce an "isIncluded" or "isInUse" filter/sort condition for the /query method to locate scripts which are included by others?  o  Do we need any (rate) limits for /test?  o  Should ":fcc" and associated arguments (e.g., ":flags", ":create":, etc) reported in the /test response be in their own "fcc" sub-object rather than listed inline with the rest of the arguments for the action?</t></abstract>
