<abstract><t>Dynamic Tasking Control Protocol is a message-based interface by which an authorized client may connect to a server -- usually a network element (NE) or security policy enforcement point (PEP) -- and issue dynamic requests for data. These tasking requests contain, among other parameters, packet matching criteria that may apply to certain packets flowing through that network element. The primary intent of the tasking request is to instruct that network element to send copies of packets matching those criteria to a destination (usually via tunneling) for further inspection or other action. The protocol contains a security architecture to address client or server spoofing as well as replay prevention. The protocol assumes that multiple clients may simultaneously control a single server.</t></abstract>
