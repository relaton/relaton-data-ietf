<abstract><t>The BIER WG has a charter item to work on mechanisms which use BIER natively in IPv6.  This document is intended to help the WG with this effort by describing the problem space of transporting packets, with Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) headers, in an IPv6 environment.  There will be a need to send IPv6 payloads, to multiple IPv6 destinations, using BIER.  There have been several proposed solutions in this area.  But there hasn't been a document which describes the problem and why this may be necessary.  The goal of this document is to describe the BIER IPv6 problem space, basic use cases, why new solutions may be needed and briefly summarize some of the proposed solutions.</t></abstract>
