<abstract><t>A flow-based routing scheme is a highly compact, flexible scheme for specify routing for both traffic engineering (TE) and fast rerouting. Many highly effective TE algorithms are proposed and evaluated based on flow-based routing.  In this document, we propose MPLS-ff, an extension to MPLS to allow efficient implementation of flow-based routing.  We present the required extensions in the MPLS data forwarding plane.  We also list the requirements in signaling for MPLS-ff.</t></abstract>
