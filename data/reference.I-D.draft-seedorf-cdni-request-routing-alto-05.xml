<abstract><t>Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering to deploy Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks.  As a consequence of this development, there is a need for interconnecting these local CDNs.  The necessary interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs are currently being defined in the Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) WG.  This document focuses on the CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI). Specifically, this document outlines how the solutions currently being defined in the Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) WG can facilitate Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement in a CDNI context, i.e. how the CDNI FCI can be realised with the ALTO protocol.  Concrete examples of how ALTO can be integrated within CDNI request routing and in particular in the process of selecting a downstream CDN are given.  The examples in this document are based on the use cases and examples currently being discussed in the CDNI WG.</t></abstract>
