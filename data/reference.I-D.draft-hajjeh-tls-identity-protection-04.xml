<abstract><t>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) supports three authentication modes: authentication of both parties, server authentication with an unauthenticated client, and total anonymity.  For each mode, TLS  specifies a set of cipher suites.  Whenever the server is authenticated, the channel is secure against man-in-the-middle attacks, but completely anonymous sessions are inherently vulnerable to such attacks.  The authentication is usually based on either preshared keys or public key certificates.  If a public key certificate is used to authenticate the TLS client during the TLS Handshake, the TLS client credentials are sent in clear text over the wire.  Thus, any observer can determine the credentials used by the client, learn who is reaching the network, when, and from where, and hence correlate the client credentials to the connection location.  This document defines a set of cipher suites to add client credential protection to the TLS protocol.  This is useful especially if TLS is used in wireless environments or to secure remote access.</t></abstract>
