<abstract><t>This document analyzes the transition to IPv6 in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) packet networks.  These networks are based on General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology, and the radio network architecture is based on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)/Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology.</t><t>The focus is on analyzing different transition scenarios and applicable transition mechanisms and finding solutions for those transition scenarios.  In these scenarios, the User Equipment (UE) connects to other nodes, e.g., in the Internet, and IPv6/IPv4 transition mechanisms are needed.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
