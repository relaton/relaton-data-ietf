<abstract><t>This memo discusses applicability for energy management features to various types of devices and buildings.  It describes the variety of applications that can use the EMAN energy framework and associated MIB modules.  P otential examples are building networks, home energy gateway, etc.  Finally, the document will also discuss relationships of the framework to other architectures and frameworks (such as smartgrid).  The applicability statement will explain the relationship between the work in this WG and the other existing standards such as those from the IEC, ANSI, DMTF, and others.</t></abstract>
