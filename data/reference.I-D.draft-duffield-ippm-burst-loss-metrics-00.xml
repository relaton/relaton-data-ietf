<abstract><t>The IPPM Working Group has developed a one way packet loss metric that measures the loss rate on a Poisson probe stream between two hosts.  However, the burst properties of packet loss are required to understand the impact of packet loss on applications.  This draft defines one-way burst packet loss metrics that express the frequency and duration of loss episode, i.e., maximal sets of consecutively lost probe packets.  The draft also defines a probing methodology under which the burst loss metrics are to be measured.</t></abstract>
