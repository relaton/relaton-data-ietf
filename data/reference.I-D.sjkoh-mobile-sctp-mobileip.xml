<abstract><t>Mobile SCTP (mSCTP) is defined as SCTP with the ADDIP extension. The mSCTP can be used for providing seamless handover by exploiting its multi-homing feature. On the other hand, the Mobile IP basically provides the location management. In this document, we discuss the use of mSCTP along with Mobile IP for Internet mobility support in the transport layer. The use of SCTP with Mobile IP is focused on the mobile sessions that are initiated by CN to MN.</t></abstract>
