<abstract><t>This document extends the Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) to support the reporting of phishing, fraud, other types of electronic crime, and widespread spam incidents. These extensions are flexible enough to support information gleaned from activities throughout the entire electronic fraud cycle. Both simple reporting and complete forensic reports are possible, as is consolidated reporting of multiple phishing incidents. The extensions defined in this document are used to generate two different types of reports: a fraud and phishing report and a wide- spread spam report. Although similar in structure, each report has different required objects and intents. RFC 2129 Keywords The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</t></abstract>
