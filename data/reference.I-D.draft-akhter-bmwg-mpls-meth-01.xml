<abstract><t>The purpose of this draft is to describe methodology specific to the benchmarking of MPLS forwarding devices. The scope of this benchmarking will be limited to various types of packet-forwarding and delay measurements. It builds upon the tenets set forth in RFC2544, RFC1242 and other IETF Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts. This document seeks to extend these efforts to the MPLS paradigm. The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents. The Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms. The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.</t></abstract>
