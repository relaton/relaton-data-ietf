<abstract><t>Many IETF protocols may use of cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality, integrity, or non-repudiation.  Communicating peers must support the same cryptographic algorithm or algorithms for these mechanisms to work properly.  This memo provides guidelines for ensuring that such a protocol has the ability to migrate from one algorithm to another over time.</t></abstract>
