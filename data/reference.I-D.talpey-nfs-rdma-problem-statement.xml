<abstract><t>This draft addresses applying Remote Direct Memory Access to the NFS protocols. NFS implementations historically incur significant overhead due to data copies on end-host systems, as well as other sources. The potential benefits of RDMA to these implementations are explored, and the reasons why RDMA is especially well-suited to NFS and network file protocols in general are evaluated.</t></abstract>
