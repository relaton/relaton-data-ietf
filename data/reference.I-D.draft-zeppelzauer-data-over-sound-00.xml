<abstract><t>This document defines a new protocol for communication via sound (and in particular via near-ultrasound) that is simple enough to be implemented on devices with limited computational resources, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.  The near-ultrasonic frequency band in the range of 18-22kHz represents a novel and so far hardly used channel for the communication of different devices, such as mobile phones, computers, TVs, personal assistants, and potentially a wide range of IoT devices.  Moreover, data-over-sound enables to connect low-end hardware devices to the Internet by near field communication with other Internet-connected devices.  Data-over-sound requires only a standard loudspeaker and a microphone for communication, and thus has very low hardware requirements compared to other communication standards such as Bluetooth, WLAN and NFC.  "SoniTalk" is designed as an open and transparent near-ultrasonic data transmission protocol for data-over-sound.  This document provides a specification of the protocol at the lowest layer (physical layer) in the sense of the OSI model.</t></abstract>
