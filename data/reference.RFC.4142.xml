<abstract><t>Classic facsimile document exchange represents both a set of technical specifications and a class of service.  Previous work has replicated some of that service class as a profile within Internet mail.  The current specification defines &quot;full mode&quot; carriage of facsimile data over the Internet, building upon that previous work and adding the remaining functionality necessary for achieving reliability and capability negotiation for Internet mail, on a par with classic T.30 facsimile.  These additional features are designed to provide the highest level of interoperability with the standards-compliant email infrastructure and mail user agents, while providing a level of service that approximates what is currently enjoyed by fax users.
