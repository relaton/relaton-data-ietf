<abstract><t>The link quality mechanism of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) enables &quot;ignoring&quot; some 1-hop neighbors if the measured link quality from that 1-hop neighbor is below an acceptable threshold while still retaining the corresponding link information as acquired from the HELLO message exchange.  This allows immediate reinstatement of the 1-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently.</t><t>NHDP also collects information about symmetric 2-hop neighbors. However, it specifies that if a link from a symmetric 1-hop neighbor ceases being symmetric, including while &quot;ignored&quot; (as described above), then corresponding symmetric 2-hop neighbors are removed. This may lead to symmetric 2-hop neighborhood information being permanently removed (until further HELLO messages are received) if the link quality of a symmetric 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold, even if only for a moment.</t><t>This specification updates RFC 6130 &quot;Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)&quot; and RFC 7181 &quot;The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2)&quot; to permit, as an option, retaining, but ignoring, symmetric 2-hop information when the link quality from the corresponding 1-hop neighbor drops below the acceptable threshold.  This allows immediate reinstatement of the symmetric 2-hop neighbor if the link quality later improves sufficiently, thus making the symmetric 2-hop neighborhood more &quot;robust&quot;.</t></abstract>
