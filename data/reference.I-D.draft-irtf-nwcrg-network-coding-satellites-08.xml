<abstract><t>This document is the product of the Coding for Efficient Network Communications Research Group (NWCRG).  This document follows the taxonomy document [RFC8406] and considers coding as a linear combination of packets that operate in and above the network layer. In this context, this memo details a multi-gateway satellite system to identify use-cases where network coding is relevant.  As example, network coding operating in and above the network layer can be exploited to cope with residual losses or provide reliable multicast services.  The objective is to contribute to a larger deployment of such techniques in SATCOM systems.  This memo also identifies open research issues related to the deployment of network coding in SATCOM systems, such as the interaction between congestion control and network coding techniques.</t></abstract>
