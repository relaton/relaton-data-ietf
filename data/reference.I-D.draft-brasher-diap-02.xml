<abstract><t>A de-centralised, self-contained and managed storage protocol.  A system to provide strong storage fail over by using existing resources over networks distributing vital data evenly.  Rapid deployment and high redundancy for small to medium organisations as well as individuals.  Designed to reduce dependency on tape backup systems.  The protocol also has implications for long term archiving. By classifying data vitality values the limitations in physical space due to bandwidth constrictions can be overcome and the usefulness of DIAP maximised.</t></abstract>
