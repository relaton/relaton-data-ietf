<abstract><t>This memo suggests a new and enhanced route optimization security mechanism for Mobile IPv6. The primary motivation for this new mechanism is the reduction of signaling load and handoff delay. The performance improvement achieved is elimination of all signaling while not moving, and most of the per-movement signaling can be done when payload traffic flow has already been moved.</t></abstract>
