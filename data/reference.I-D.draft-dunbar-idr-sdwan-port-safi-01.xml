<abstract><t>The document specifies a new BGP NLRI and SAFI for advertising properties of a SDWAN edge node WAN ports that face untrusted networks, such as the public internet. Those WAN ports may get assigned IP addresses from the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), may get assigned dynamic IP addresses via DHCP, or may have private addresses (e.g. inside third party Cloud DCs). Packets sent over those SDWAN WAN ports might need to be encrypted (depending on the user policies) or need to go through NAT. SDWAN edge need to propagate those WAN ports properties to its SDWAN controller, which propagates to the authorized peers and manage the IPsec SAs among those peers for encrypting traffic via the untrusted networks.  BGP Route Reflectors (RR) are proposed as points of combination for this information in order to allow scaling of the SDWAN.</t></abstract>
