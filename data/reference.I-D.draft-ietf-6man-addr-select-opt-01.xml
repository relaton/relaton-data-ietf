<abstract><t>RFC 3484 defines default address selection mechanisms for IPv6 that allow nodes to select appropriate address when faced with multiple source and/or destination addresses to choose between.  The RFC allowed for the future definition of methods to administratively configure the address selection policy information.  This document defines a new DHCPv6 option for such configuration, allowing a site administrator to distribute address selection policy, and thus control the address selection behavior of nodes in their site.  While RFC 3484 is in the process of being updated, with a revised default policy table, that table may not suit every scenario, and thus the DHCPv6 option defined in this text may be used to override that policy where desired.</t></abstract>
