<abstract><t>The Source Address Validation Improvement protocol was developed to complement ingress filtering with finer-grained, standardized IP source address validation.  To facilitate deployment in networks of various kinds, the SAVI protocol was designed to be modular and extensible.  This document describes and motivates the design of the SAVI protocol, explains how the protocol is composed of components, and compares the properties of alternative protocol components.</t></abstract>
