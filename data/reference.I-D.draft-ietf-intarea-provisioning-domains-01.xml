<abstract><t>An increasing number of hosts access the Internet via multiple interfaces or, in IPv6 multi-homed networks, via multiple IPv6 prefix configurations.  This document describes a way for hosts to identify such means, called Provisioning Domains (PvDs), with Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN).  Those identifiers are advertised in a new Router Advertisement (RA) option and, when present, are associated with the set of information included within the RA.  Based on this FQDN, hosts can retrieve additional information about their network access characteristics via an HTTP over TLS query. This allows applications to select which Provisioning Domains to use as well as to provide configuration parameters to the transport layer and above.</t></abstract>
