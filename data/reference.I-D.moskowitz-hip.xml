<abstract><t>This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). The overall description of protocol and the underlying architectural thinking is available in the separate HIP architecture specification. The Host Identity Protocol is used to establish a rapid authentication between two hosts and to provide continuity of communications between those hosts independent of the networking layer. The various forms of the Host Identity (HI), Host Identity Tag (HIT), and Local Scope Identifier (LSI), are covered in detail. It is described how they are used to support authentication and the establishment of keying material, which is then used by IPsec Encapsulated Security payload (ESP) to establish a two-way secured communication channel between the hosts. The basic state machine for HIP provides a HIP compliant host with the resiliency to avoid many denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The basic HIP exchange for two public hosts shows the actual packet flow. Other HIP exchanges, including those that work across NATs are covered elsewhere.</t></abstract>
