<abstract><t>The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that it does not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses.  The CoRE CoAP specification defines basic behavior that exhibits low risk of congestion with minimal implementation requirements.  It also leaves room for combining the base specification with advanced congestion control mechanisms with higher performance.  This specification defines some simple advanced CoRE Congestion Control mechanisms, Simple CoCoA.  In the present version -01, it is already making use of some input from simulations, but might still benefit from simplifying it further.</t></abstract>
