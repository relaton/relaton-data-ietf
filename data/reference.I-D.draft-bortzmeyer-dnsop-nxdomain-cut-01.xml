<abstract><t>This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives a response with response code NXDOMAIN, it means that the name in the question section AND ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist.  REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: this document should be discussed in the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its mailing list.  The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently kept at Github [1].</t></abstract>
