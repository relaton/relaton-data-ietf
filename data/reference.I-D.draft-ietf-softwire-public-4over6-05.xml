<abstract><t>When the service provider networks are upgraded to IPv6, end users will continue to demand IPv4 connectivity.  This document proposes a mechanism for hosts or customer networks in IPv6 access network to build bidirectional IPv4 communication with the IPv4 Internet.  The mechanism follows the hub and spokes softwire model, and uses IPv4- over-IPv6 tunnel as basic method to traverse IPv6 network.  The bi- directionality of this IPv4 communication is achieved by explicitly allocating public IPv4 addresses to end users, as well as maintaining IPv4-IPv6 address binding on the border relay.  This mechanism features the allocation of full IPv4 address over IPv6 network, and has been used in production for high-end IPv4 users, IPv6 transition of ICPs, etc.</t></abstract>
