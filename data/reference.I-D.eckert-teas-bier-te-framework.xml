<abstract><t>BIER-TE is an application-state free, (loose) source routed multicast forwarding method where every hop and destination is identified via bits in a bitstring of the data packets.  It is described in [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch].  BIER-TE is a variant of [RFC8279] in support of such explicit path engineering.  This document described the traffic engineering control framework for use with the BIER-TE forwarding plane: How to enable the ability to calculate paths and integrate this forwarding plane into an overall TE solution.</t></abstract>
