<abstract><t>This document defines the format of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI) as defined in [RFC3987], for designating connections and destination addresses used in the Java(tm) Messaging Service (JMS) [REF-JMS]. It was originally designed for particular uses, but should have general applicability wherever a JMS IRI is needed to describe the connection to a JMS provider, and access to a JMS destination. The syntax of 'jms' IRIs is not compatible with any known current vendor implementation, but the expressivity of the format should permit all vendors to use it.</t></abstract>
