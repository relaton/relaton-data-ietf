<abstract><t>This document requests the allocation of an IPv4 /10 address block to be used as Shared Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGN) Space.  Service Providers will use Shared CGN Space to number the interfaces that connect CGN devices to Customer Premise Equipment (CPE).  Shared CGN Space is distinct from RFC1918 private address space because it is intended for use on Service Provider networks. However, it may be used as RFC 1918 private address space in certain circumstances.  Details are provided in the text of this document.  As this document proposes the allocation of an additional special-use IPv4 address block, it updates RFC 5735.</t></abstract>
