<abstract><t>IETF is designing a new service called ALTO (Application Layer traffic Optimization) that includes a "Network Map Service", an "Endpoint Cost Service" and an "Endpoint (EP) Ranking Service" and thus incentives for application clients to connect to ISP preferred Endpoints.  These services provide a view of the Network Provider (NP) topology to overlay clients.  The present draft proposes a light way to extend the information provided by the current ALTO protocol in two ways.  First, including information on multiple cost types in a single ALTO transaction provides a better mapping of the Selected Endpoints to needs of the growing diversity of Content and Resources Networking Applications and to the network conditions.  Second, one ALTO query and response exchange on N Cost Types is faster and lighter than N single cost transactions.  All this also helps producing a faster and more robust choice when multiple Endpoints need to be selected.</t></abstract>
