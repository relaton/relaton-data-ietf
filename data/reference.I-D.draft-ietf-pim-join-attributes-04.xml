<abstract><t>A Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Join message sent by a given node identifies one or more multicast distribution trees that that node wishes to join.  Each tree is identified by a multicast group address and a source address, which is possibly a "wild card".  Under certain conditions it can be useful, when joining a tree, to specify additional information related to the construction of the tree. However, there is up to now no way to do so.  This document describes a modification of the Join message that allows a node to associate attributes with a particular tree.  The attributes are encoded in Type-Length-Value format.</t></abstract>
