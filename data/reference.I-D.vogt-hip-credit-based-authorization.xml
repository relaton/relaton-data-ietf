<abstract><t>End-host mobility with the Host Identity Protocol uses IP-address tests to protect against malicious packet redirection and third-party flooding. The tests cause handover signaling delays to increase by one round-trip time. This document proposes a credit-based strategy that allows peers to securely resume active communications after handover as soon as possible, and to pursue a concurrent IP-address test subsequently. The optimization thus eliminates the additional handover delay that IP-address tests entail.</t></abstract>
