<abstract><t>This draft attempts to fill a portion of the gap between DNSSEC deployment expectations and the lack of DNSSEC trust anchor key management solutions, protocol and procedural aspects. Specific requirements are stated at a level of abstraction that should accommodate solution alternatives to the issues of providing trust anchor keys to DNSSEC-aware resolvers, and rolling those keys. Nonetheless, the characteristics the DNSSEC protocols and the DNS operation contingencies do shape many of the requirements.</t></abstract>
