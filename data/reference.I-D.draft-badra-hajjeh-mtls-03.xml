<abstract><t>The Transport Layer Security (TLS) standard provides connection security with mutual authentication, data confidentiality and integrity, key generation and distribution, and security parameters negotiation. However, missing from the protocol is a way to multiplex application data over a single TLS session.  This document defines MTLS, a new TLS sub-protocol running over TLS (or DTLS) Record protocol. The MTLS design provides application multiplexing over a single TLS (or DTLS) session. Therefore, instead of associating a TLS connection with each application, MTLS allows several applications to protect their exchanges over a single TLS session.</t></abstract>
