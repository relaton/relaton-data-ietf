<abstract><t>This document defines an extension to the Time Zone Data Distribution Service (RFC 7808) to allow a mobile device to retrieve the time zones associated with a geographic location as specified by a 'geo' URI (RFC 5870).  Open Issues  o  Determine which, if any, GEOPRIV requirements we need to follow and how they impact Security/Privacy considerations.  o  Need a new field(s) in the response to indicate which time zone(s) contain the point location vs those which are nearby (intersect the radius of uncertainty).</t></abstract>
