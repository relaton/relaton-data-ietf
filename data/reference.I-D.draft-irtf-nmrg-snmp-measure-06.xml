<title>SNMP Traffic Measurements and Trace Exchange Formats</title>

<date month='September' day='16' year='2008' />

<abstract><t>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is widely deployed to monitor, control and (sometimes also) configure network elements. Even though the SNMP technology is well documented, it remains relatively unclear how SNMP is used in practice and what typical SNMP usage patterns are.  This document describes an approach to carrying out large scale SNMP traffic measurements in order to develop a better understanding how SNMP is used in real world production networks.  It describes the motivation, the measurement approach, and the tools and data formats needed to carry out such a study.  This document was produced within the IRTF's Network Management Research Group (NMRG) and represents the consensus of all of the active contributors to this group.</t></abstract>
