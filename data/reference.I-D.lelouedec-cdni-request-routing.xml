<abstract><t>The present document proposes to clarify the CDNI Request Routing interface introduced in [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] and [I-D.ietf-cdni- problem-statement], as well as related terminology.  In particular the present document proposes to split the CDNI Request Routing interface into two separate interfaces with clearer roles, named respectively CDNI Routing interface and CDNI Downstream Resource Identifier Signaling interface (CDNI DRIS interface).  This part of the CDN interconnection framework the IETF has been referring to so far with the term "CDNI Request Routing" is just another routing, signaling and forwarding problem in a long series of the telecommunication history.  For example, one can draw a direct analogy between the IP/MPLS-TE framework and the CDN interconnection framework.  In addition, this document recommends that the specification of ALL CDN interconnection interfaces in the scope of the CDNI IETF WG relies on the equivalent concept to IP prefix for CDN interconnection, named 'contentRequestScope'.  This highly useful and powerful concept SHALL be used to simplify the specification of ALL CDN interconnection interfaces, as well as to ensure performance and scalability in CDN interconnection.  All these proposals can be smoothly integrated in the WG drafts, especially [I-D.ietf-cdni-framework] and [I-D.ietf-cdni-requirements], as they essentially propose (useful) clarifications of the existing framework.</t></abstract>
