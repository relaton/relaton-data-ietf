<abstract><t>This document defines a mechanism that ensures EAP-TLS identity protection. The main idea is to encrypt the client's certificate. Three procedures are proposed in order to determine the certificate encryption mechanism, - Implicit, the client's certificate is encrypted according to a pre-defined algorithm, deduced from the server's certificate. - Notified, the EAP-identity response message, delivered by the client includes information that precise the encryption algorithm to be used. - Negotiated, the client indicates a list of encryption algorithm, the server chooses one of them, and indicates its choice.</t></abstract>
