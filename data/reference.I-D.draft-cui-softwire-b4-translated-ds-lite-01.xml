<abstract><t>The dual-stack lite mechanism provide an IPv4 access method over IPv6 ISP network for end users.  Dual-Stack Lite enables a broadband service provider to share IPv4 addresses among customers by combining IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel and Carrier Grade NAT.  However, in dual-stack lite.  CGN has to maintain per-session address mapping, which could be a heavy burden, and produce high hardware cost as well as performance issue.  This draft propose the lightweight 4over6 mechanism which moves the translation function from tunnel concentrator (AFTR) to initiators (B4s), and hence reduce the mapping scale on CGN to per-customer level.  For translation usage, the mechanism will allocate port restrcted IPv4 addresses to initiators in a flexible way independent of IPv6 network in the middle.</t></abstract>
