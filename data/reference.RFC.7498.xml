<abstract><t>This document provides an overview of the issues associated with the deployment of service functions (such as firewalls, load balancers, etc.) in large-scale environments.  The term &quot;service function                                         chaining&quot; is used to describe the definition and instantiation of an ordered list of instances of such service functions, and the subsequent &quot;steering&quot; of traffic flows through those service functions.</t><t>The set of enabled service function chains reflects operator service offerings and is designed in conjunction with application delivery and service and network policy.</t><t>This document also identifies several key areas that the Service Function Chaining (SFC) working group will investigate to guide its architectural and protocol work and associated documents.</t></abstract>
