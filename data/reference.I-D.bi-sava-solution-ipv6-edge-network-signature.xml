<abstract><t>Today's Internet is suffering from reflection-type DoS/DDoS attacks, such as TCP SYN flood, Smurf attack, DNS reflection, etc. These attacks often rely on the IP source address spoofing. Current source address spoofing prevention methods have a coarse granularity, and the attackers can still in some cases launch reflection-type DoS/DDos attacks or other attacks while being difficult to trace. Aiming to solve this problem, this document proposes a fine-granularity source address spoofing prevention method, which can prevent the attackers from forging source addresses that belong to the same edge network to send packets to somewhere outside the IPv6 edge network. The proposed method includes source address authentication using session key and hash digest algorithms and replay attack prevention by combining a sequence number method with a timestamp method.</t></abstract>
