<abstract><t>This document describes a proxy rapid acquisition mechanism which reduces acquisition delay for an RTP receiver without supporting any rapid acquisition related functionality.  The network is responsible for managing rapid acquisition on behalf of the RTP receiver, including detecting SFGMP message as proxy specified in [RFC4605] from the RTP receiver and launching the required rapid acquisition signaling instead of the RTP receiver.  This proxy rapid acquisition of multicast RTP session in this document is referred to as Proxy Rapid Acquisition of Multicast Sessions.</t></abstract>
