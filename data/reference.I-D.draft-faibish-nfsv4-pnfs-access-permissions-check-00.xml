<abstract><t>This document describe an extension to pNFS protocol addressing a gap related to the access permission checks to data servers used by the MDS in layouts sent to the clients. The draft addresses both the client access permission checks as well as the MDS access permissions to the data servers. The draft will address new errors related to access permission denial to devices included in valid pNFS layouts. The draft will also address the case when clients request direct NFS access to the MDS and the MDS has no permission to access some of the data servers included in valid layouts.</t></abstract>
