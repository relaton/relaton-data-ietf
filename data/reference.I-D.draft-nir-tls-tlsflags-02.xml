<abstract><t>A number of extensions are proposed in the TLS working group that carry no interesting information except the 1-bit indication that a certain optional feature is supported.  Such extensions take 4 octets each.  This document defines a flags extension that can provide such indications at an average marginal cost of 1 bit each.  More precisely, it provides as many flag extensions as needed at 4 + the order of the last set bit divided by 8.</t></abstract>
