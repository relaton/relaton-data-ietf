<abstract><t>This document describes a mechanism to secure TCP-based pairwise Routing Protocol (RP) associations using the IKEv2 Key Management Protocol (KMP) integrated with TCP-AO.  A Gatekeeper (GK) mechanism is introduced to allow TCP-AO to coordinate with IKEv2 without fundamental modification to either.  This document also introduces extensions to IKEv2 and its Security Associations to enable its key negotiation to support TCP-AO.  The document also includes a summary of IKEv2 authentication methods available for peer authentication for use in protecting routing protocols.</t></abstract>
