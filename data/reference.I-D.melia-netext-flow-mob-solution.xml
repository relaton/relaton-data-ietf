<abstract><t>The Netext WG has been recently rechartered to determine what Proxy Mobile IPv6 extensions are required for flow mobility support of a MN implementing the single IP interface hiding mechanism.  This document briefly introduces the single IP interface hiding mechanism and it derives the associated protocol operations to enable seamless flow mobility across multiple access networks.  These extensions are intended to allow such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets on multiple physical media in a simultaneous and possibly discriminated manner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain.  A typical usage of these extensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination through multiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MN physical media to VOIP traffic and another MN media to HTTP traffic).  The proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backward compatible manner the current PMIPv6 specification.  In addition these extensions use, when possible, existing specifications related to multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statement of Netext Working Group.</t></abstract>
