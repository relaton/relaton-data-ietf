<abstract><t>This document proposes a solution to avoid the use of two stateful CGN (a.k.a., AFTR in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite]) devices when both participants (a.k.a., B4 element) are located behind different CGN devices.  For this purpose a new IPv6 extension header, called Tunnel Endpoint Extension Header (TEEH), is defined.  The proposed procedure encourages the use of IPv6 between AFTR nodes as a means to avoid the unnecessary crossing of AFTR devices.</t></abstract>
