<abstract><t>Most of Peer-to-Peer survey papers are described about the P2P applications architecture. It is hard to compare PPSP with them with the high-level description. In this survey, we focus on the message design for the well-known P2P file downloading and streaming applications (Bittorrent and eMule) and study their base and enhancement approach in the peer and tracker protocol specifications. Through the survey, we summarize a common message design for the P2P streaming Protocol standardization.</t></abstract>
