<abstract><t>This document provides a problem statement for non-realtime communication between systems that are generally disconnected, which require multiple network hops between source and destination, and which may never be fully connected end-to-end at any given time. This document describes a number of use cases that motivate having a standard method to communicate between such systems, as multi- organization and multi-vendor support and interoperability is highly desirable.  These use cases include dismounted soldiers, sensorwebs, medical devices, animal tracking, low-Earth-orbiting satellites and data mule scenarios.  To avoid confusion in terminology when trying to focus on the problem and requirements without bias towards particular technical solutions, at this time, we refer to the protocol instances that would support such communications as Store, Carry, and Forwarding (SCF) agents, and refer to their activity as SCF networking.  The concepts involved in SCF networking are not entirely new and several facets of the problem have been solved in multiple incompatible ways in existing or historic systems.  This document describes the core SCF problem and gives an assessment of the ability to use existing technologies as solutions.</t></abstract>
