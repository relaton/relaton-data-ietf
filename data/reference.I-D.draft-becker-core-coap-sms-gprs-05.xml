<abstract><t>Short Message Service (SMS) of mobile cellular networks is frequently used in Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such as for telematic devices.  The service offers small packet sizes and high delays just as other typical low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), i.e. 6LoWPANs.  The design of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252], that took the limitations of LLNs into account, is thus also applicable to other transports.  The adaptation of CoAP to SMS transport mechanisms is described in this document.</t></abstract>
