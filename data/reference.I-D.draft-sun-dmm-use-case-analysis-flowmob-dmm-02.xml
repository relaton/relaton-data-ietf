<abstract><t>Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) allows network traffic to distribute among multiple mobility anchors which have mobility functions to solve the existing problems in current centralized mobility protocols. There are many DMM approaches extending network- based mobility protocols (e.g. Proxy Mobile IPv6).  In Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213], they allow a mobile node to connect to PMIPv6 domain through different physical interfaces. In this reason, flow mobility that enables movement between physical interfaces of mobile node is proposed.  In this document, we present some use cases to support flow mobility in DMM domain and analyze some problems. These use cases are based on scenarios of flow mobility in PMIPv6. In these scenarios, a multi-interface mobile node connects to different distributed mobility access points and move specific flows from one interface to another. These use cases have common issues which will be analyzed in detail.</t></abstract>
