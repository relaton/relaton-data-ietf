<abstract><t>With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber-security and data protection are of increasing importance.  This is especially the case regarding cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with the physical world.  Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to financial and physical damage and endanger human lives and well- being.  Thus, hard security and privacy requirements are necessary to be met.  Furthermore, thorough investigation of incidents is essential for ultimate protection.  In-network computing allows the processing of traffic and data directly in the network and at line- rate.  Thus, the in-network computing paradigm presents a promising solution for efficiently providing security and privacy mechanisms as well as event analysis.  This document discusses select mechanisms to demonstrate how in-network computing concepts can be applied to encounter current shortcomings of cyber-security and data privacy.</t></abstract>
