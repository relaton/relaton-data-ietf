<abstract><t>Subscription is a integral part of the current Web Push service. However, the current explicit subscription requirement makes it difficult to use web push in a number of use cases where there may be a need to reach User Agents that are not subscribed to the Web Push service. In addition, the current Web Push subscription model does not provide a mechanism to achieve coordination and control among subscriptions associated to different applications. This document describes a framework for making subscription more flexible and solve these issues.</t></abstract>
