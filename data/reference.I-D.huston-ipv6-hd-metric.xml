<abstract><t>This memo provides an analysis of the Host Density metric as currently used to guide registry allocations of IPv6 unicast address blocks. This document contrasts the address efficiency as currently adopted in the allocation of IPv4 network addresses and that used by the IPv6 protocol. It is noted that for large allocations there are very significant variations in the target efficiency metric between the two approaches. The memo notes that the IPv6 address assignment efficiency metric would benefit from a detailed technical review, particularly relating to large scale deployments of public infrastructure.</t></abstract>
