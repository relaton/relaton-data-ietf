<abstract><t>In this document, we propose to the PCN WG for review, discussion and evaluation of a method for marking real-time packets to indicate that removal (preemption) of excess real-time traffic from the network is needed. First, we define the marking behavior in the interior node followed with a brief description of how this marking would work in the edge-to-edge and application-control deployment models with simulations results for different conditions and traffic mixes. Then, we discuss the simulation results for voice, both constant rate and variable rate with silence suppression, and variable rate MPEG-4 like video traffic with large and small number of flows at the congestion point.</t></abstract>
