<abstract><t>This document discusses problem statement and use cases on IP-based vehicular networks, which are considered a key component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  The main topics of vehicular networking are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to- infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networking. First, this document surveys use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking.  Second, this document analyzes current protocols for vehicular networking and general problems on those current protocols. Third, this document does problem exploration for key aspects in IP- based vehicular networking, such as IPv6 over IEEE 802.11-OCB, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, Mobility Management, Vehicle Identities Management, Multihop V2X Communications, Multicast, DNS Naming Services, Service Discovery, IPv6 over Cellular Networks, Security and Privacy.  For each key aspect, this document discusses problem statement to analyze the gap between the state-of-the-art techniques and requirements in IP-based vehicular networking.</t></abstract>
