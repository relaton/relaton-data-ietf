<abstract><t>The existing SIP identity mechanism (RFC4474) creates a signature over the SIP body, including the entire SDP. As part of their normal operation, Session Border Controllers (SBCs) and SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs) modify various fields in the SDP, breaking the signature. This document defines a new mechanism to securely identify the originator of a SIP message while also allowing modification of the SDP by SBCs and B2BUAs. This new mechanism creates a signature over certain SIP headers and certain SDP lines. Proof of identity over the media path using DTLS, TLS, HIP, and an extension to ICE are described.</t></abstract>
