<abstract><t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Security Layer (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP.  Over the last few years, several serious attacks on TLS have emerged, including attacks on its most commonly used cipher suites and modes of operation.  This document provides recommendations for improving the security of both software implementations and deployed services that use TLS and DTLS.</t></abstract>
