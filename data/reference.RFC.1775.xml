<abstract><t>The Internet permits different levels of access for consumers and providers of service.  The nature of those differences is quite important in the capabilities They afford.  Hence, it is appropriate to provide terminology that distinguishes among the range, so that the Internet community can gain some clarity when distinguishing whether a user (or an organization) is &quot;on&quot; the Internet.  This document suggests four terms, for distinguishing the major classes of access. This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</t></abstract>
