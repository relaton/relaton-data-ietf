<abstract><t>By the early 1990s it had become clear that RFC 1036, the then specification for the Interchange of USENET Messages, was badly in need of repair. This "INTERNET DRAFT to be", though never formally published at that time, was widely circulated and became the de facto   standard for implementors of News Servers and User Agents, rapidly acquiring the nickname "Son of 1036". Indeed, under that name, it could fairly be described as the best-known Internet Draft (n)ever published, and it formed the starting point for the recently adopted Proposed Standards for Netnews.  It is being published now in order to provide the Historical Background out of which those standards have grown. Present-day implementors should be aware that it is NOT NOW APPROPRIATE for use in current implementations.</t></abstract>
