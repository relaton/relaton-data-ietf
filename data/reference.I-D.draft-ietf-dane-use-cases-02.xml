<abstract><t>Many current applications use the certificate-based authentication features in TLS to allow clients to verify that a connected server properly represents a desired domain name.  Traditionally, this authentication has been based on PKIX trust hierarchies, rooted in well-known CAs, but additional information can be provided via the DNS itself.  This document describes a set of use cases in which the DNS and DNSSEC could be used to make assertions that support the TLS authentication process.</t></abstract>
