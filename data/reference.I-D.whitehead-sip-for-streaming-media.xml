<abstract><t>This draft reviews requirements and evaluates solutions to improve the integration of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] to the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP and RTSP v2) [RFC 2326 and IDRTSP] especially in the context of converged media services. The document develops a rationale and solution space for using SIP with streaming media applications. This is done by first considering use cases that are used to define generic requirements to help compare the current and potentially new solutions. The range of solutions is sketched out (at high-level) and advantages and disadvantages discussed. The solutions evaluated address different levels of integration from SIP-only approaches to dual-protocol solutions.</t></abstract>
