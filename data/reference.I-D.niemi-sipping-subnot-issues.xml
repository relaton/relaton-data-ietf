<abstract><t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enables receiving asynchronous notification of events related to SIP systems. This framework defines the procedures for creating, refreshing and terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching and periodic polling of resource state. These procedures have a serious deficiency in that they do not allow state to persist over a subscription refresh, or between two consecutive polls. Another related but different problem relates to the relative intolerance of the framework to interferences in networking connectivity of subscribers in long- lasting subscriptions. This document explains the problems in more detail and discusses possible solutions.</t></abstract>
