<abstract><t>This document describes an interface between mobile nodes (MNs) and a mobility access gateway (MAG) of a network-based localized mobility management (NETLMM) domain.  The interface has two functions which are invoked when a MN attaches and detaches from a MAG.  The attachment function lets the MAG authenticate the MN identifier, does address(es) and default router configuration for the MN, and informs the MAG about the multicast listener state of the MN.  During the attachment function the NETLMM protocol is triggered between the MAG and Localized Mobility Anchor (LMA) to register the MN in the local domain.  The detachment function lets the MAG detect that the MN has left so that it can deregister the MN at the LMA using the NETLMM protocol.</t></abstract>
