<abstract><t>This document proposes an extension to IS-IS to allow the use of any cryptographic authentication algorithm in addition to the already documented authentication schemes, described in the base specification and RFC 3567. Although this document has been written specifically for using MAC construct along with the SHA family of cryptographic hash functions, the method described in this document is generic and can be used to extend IS-IS to support any cryptographic hash function in the future.</t></abstract>
