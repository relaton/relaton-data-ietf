<abstract><t>This document proposes a cross-realm traversal model, which is suitable for resource-limited clients, for Kerberos Version 5.  This model relieves the clients of the traversal cost by two means.  One moves the cost of consecutive Ticket-Granting Service (TGS) exchanges from clients to Key Distribution Centers (KDCs).  The other reduces the traversal cost itself by generating a direct inter-realm relationship between two realms.  The document describes behavior of clients and KDCs, but does not specify any wire format, which need to be specified separately.</t></abstract>
