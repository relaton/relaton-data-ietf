<abstract><t>Performance issues have been observed when multicast packet transmissions of IETF protocols are used over IEEE 802 wireless media.  Even though enhamcements for multicast transmissions have been designed at both IETF and IEEE 802, there seems to exist a disconnect between specifications, implementations and configuration choices.  This draft describes the different issues that have been observed, the multicast enhancement features that have been specified at IETF and IEEE 802 for wireless media, as well as the operational chioces that can be taken to improve the performace of the network. Finally, it provides some recommendations about the usage and combination of these features and operational choices.</t></abstract>
