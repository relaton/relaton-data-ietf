<abstract><t>IPv6 link-local addresses are formed from the prefix fe80::/10 which is followed by 54 &quot;zero&quot; bits, then followed by a 64-bit Interface Identifier.  There are multiple methods for generating link-local addresses, and multiple may be in use by nodes on the same link (and sometimes even the same interface) at the same time.  This document defines an IPv6 link-local address &quot;Type&quot; field that identifies the type of link-local address being used.</t></abstract>
