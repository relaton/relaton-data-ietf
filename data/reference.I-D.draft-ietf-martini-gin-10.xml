<abstract><t>This document defines a mechanism by which a SIP server acting as a traditional Private Branch Exchange (SIP-PBX) can register with a SIP Service Provider (SSP) to receive phone calls for UAs designated by phone numbers.  In order to function properly, this mechanism relies on the fact that the phone numbers are fully qualified and globally unique.</t></abstract>
