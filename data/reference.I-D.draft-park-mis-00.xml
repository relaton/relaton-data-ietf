<abstract><t>In this draft, we discuss how to make use of multiple interfaces in a single mobile router. We will focus on the scenario in which each interface is attached to different access network. Especially, we propose how a mobile router selects proper interfaces to provide services to different traffic flows. We suggest two methods to do that. First we suggest a new option carried in IPv6 hop-by-hop options header, and we will use the flow label field in the IPv6 main header. The flow label field is used to distinguish different packets belonging to different traffic flows. New option contains a service type value and a preference value. A servie type value is used for traffic classification, and a preference value enables mobile router to control the traffic in detail. The propsed multiple interface selection mechanism in a multihomed mobile router (MMR) chooses an appropriate interface for each flow, depending on traffic requirements and access network characteristics.</t></abstract>
