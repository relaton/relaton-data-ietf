<abstract><t>This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.  This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity.  PRoPHET is a routing protocol for intermittently connected networks, where there is no guarantee that a fully connected path between source and destination exists at any time, rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messages between hosts.  These networks are examples of networks where there is a disparity between the latency requirements of applications and the capabilities of the underlying network (networks often referred to as Delay and Disruption Tolerant).  The document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol specification.</t></abstract>
