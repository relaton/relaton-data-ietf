<abstract><t>This document specifies a vehicular mobility management scheme for IP-based vehicular networks.  The vehicular mobility management scheme takes advantage of a vehicular link model based on a multi- link subnet.  With a vehicle's mobility information (e.g., position, speed, and direction) and navigation path (i.e., trajectory), it can provide a moving vehicle with proactive and seamless handoff along with its trajectory.</t></abstract>
