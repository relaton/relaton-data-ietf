<abstract><t>The role of Working Group Secretaries has greatly evolved and increased in value since the writing of RFC 2418 ("IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures"). This document further refines and enriches the description of the Working Group Secretarial role, and consequently updates RFC 2418. This document complements the succinct description of the role of Working Group Secretaries by providing a compilation of good practices and some general guidelines regarding the fulfilment of the role.  This document may also be useful for Working Group Chairs to help develop and better appreciate the value of Working Group Secretaries.</t></abstract>
