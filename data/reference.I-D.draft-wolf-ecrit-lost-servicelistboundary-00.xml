<abstract><t>LoST [I-D.ietf-ecrit-lost] is able to map service identifiers and location information to service contact URIs.  If a LoST client wants to discover available services for a particular location, it will perform a &lt;listServicesByLocation> query to the LoST server. However, the response from the LoST server does not give information about the geographical region, for which the returned service list is valid.  Therefore this document proposes a ServiceListBoundary, in addition to the ServiceBoundary (which indicates the region a specific service URL is valid).</t></abstract>
