<abstract><t>The importance of naming in information systems is explained with reference to a typical use case.  Existing Internet naming systems attempt to strike a balance between usability and machine readability.  An alternative approach in which separate classes of identifiers are introduced for human and machine interaction is described.  Human Interaction Identifiers are interpreted in the context in which they are used and are thus more compact and offer a superior user experience.  Strong Internet Names are a form of Machine Interaction Identifier that are backwards compatible with existing Internet names that include a DNS address and are cryptographically bound to a security policy governing interpretation.  The application of these approaches in the Mathematical Mesh is described.
