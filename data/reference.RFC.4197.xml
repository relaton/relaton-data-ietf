<abstract><t>This document defines the specific requirements for edge-to-edge emulation of circuits carrying Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) digital signals of the Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy as well as the Synchronous Optical NETwork/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy over packet-switched networks.  It is aligned to the common architecture for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3).  It makes references to the generic requirements for PWE3 where applicable and complements them by defining requirements originating from specifics of TDM circuits.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
