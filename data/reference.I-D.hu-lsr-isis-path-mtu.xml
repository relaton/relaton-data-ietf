<abstract><t>Segment routing (SR) leverages the source routing mechanism.  It allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths with IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths which is called segments.  These segments are advertised by the link- state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).  Unlike the MPLS, SR does not have the specific path construction signaling so that it cannot support the Path MTU.  This draft provides the necessary IS-IS extensions about the Path MTU that need to be used on SR.</t></abstract>
