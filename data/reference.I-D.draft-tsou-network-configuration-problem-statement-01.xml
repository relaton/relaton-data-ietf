<abstract><t>With the network evolution to all IP, the network configuration needs to be enhanced because of large number of network devices and service tunnels.  The existing IP network management mainly depends on manual configuration. The cost will be very high if all these work are performed manually and it is a great burden for service providers to deploy and maintain such large scale IP networks.  This document discusses problems related to reducing network configuration workload and transmission tunnel setup between network devices and NMS (Network Management System).</t></abstract>
