<abstract><t>The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based on multi-dimensional criteria such as the number of hops, the performance of the connections between the user-agent and downstream CDNs, the availability of downstream CDNs resources and business policies.  Various protocols, such as BGP or ALTO, may be used by a downstream CDN to expose content routing information and interconnection preferences to an upstream CDN.  This draft specifies the parameters of an ALTO session between two interconnected CDNs.</t></abstract>
