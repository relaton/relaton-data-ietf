<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) technology leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigms where a source node can choose a path without relying on hop-by-hop signaling.  The same mechanism can also be utilized for Service Function Chaining (SFC) to steer packets through service functions performing specific services such as DPI, Firewall, accounting etc.  This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and instantiate SR-TE paths that have service functions (SF) (or service segments) involved.</t></abstract>
