<abstract><t>This document describes a method for encapsulating network layer protocols within UDP such that the payload protocol can be identified from the destination port value. The mechanism also allows for the source port to be used as the entropy field for the purpose of load balancing in environments such as Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) in the underlying IP network.  Application of this technique is focused on tunneling network protocol flows across IP networks in environments where load- balancing is required. No changes to the underlying IP network or the payload networks are required.</t></abstract>
