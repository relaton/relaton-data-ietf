<abstract><t>The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.  This often involves accessing the archived history of those email lists. Participants would like to have the ability to browse and search those archives using standard IMAP clients.  This memo captures the requirements for providing a service that would allow such browsing and searching.</t></abstract>
