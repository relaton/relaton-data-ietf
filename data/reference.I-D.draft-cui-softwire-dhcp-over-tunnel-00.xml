<abstract><t>This document analyzes the situation where DHCPv4 is performed over IP-IP tunnel, and proposes methods to keep DHCP working under such situation.  The main issue is encapsulation of DHCP packets on server side, and there're both in-protocol solution and out-of-protocol solutions for this issue.  The in-protocol solution is to have DHCP carrying the encapsulation address information, and the out-of- protocol solution is to have the DHCP server keeping track of the address mapping by inspecting DHCP packet.</t></abstract>
