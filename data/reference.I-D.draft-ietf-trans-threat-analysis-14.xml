<abstract><t>This document describes an attack model and discusses threats for the Web PKI context for which security mechanisms to detect mis-issuance of web site certificates are being developed.  The model provides an analysis of detection and remediation mechanisms for both syntactic and semantic mis-issuance.  The model introduces an outline of attacks to organize the discussion.  The model also describes the roles played by the elements of the Certificate Transparency (CT) system, to establish a context for the model.</t></abstract>
