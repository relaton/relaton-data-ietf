<abstract><t>Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) have recently been introduced as a field type in proposed Delay-Tolerant Networking protocols. SDNVs encode an arbitrary-length non-negative integer or arbitrary- length bitstring with minimum overhead.  They are intended to provide protocol flexibility without sacrificing economy and to assist in future-proofing protocols under development.  This document describes formats and algorithms for SDNV encoding and decoding, along with notes on implementation and usage.  This document is a product of the Delay-Tolerant Networking Research Group and has been reviewed by that group.  No objections to its publication as an RFC were raised.  This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t></abstract>
