<abstract><t>Both History-Info and Diversion headers are able to transport diverting information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) signaling. This document proposes a way to map call forwarding information contained in a Diversion header into a History-Info header and vice versa.  In addition, an interworking policy is proposed to manage the headers coexistence. Prior to existence of [RFC4244] describing the History-Info header, there was a draft introducing a header named Diversion for the transport of diversion information. Since the Diversion header is used in many existing networks implementations and it is not standardized for transport of diversion information, a mapping with the standardized History-Info header is needed.</t></abstract>
