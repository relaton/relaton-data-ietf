<abstract><t>Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple communication networks based on different technology implementations and network architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL.  In such multi- connectivity scenario, it is desirable to combine multiple access networks or select the best one to improve quality of experience for a user and improve overall network utilization and efficiency.  This document presents the control plane protocols, as well as describes control plane procedures for configuring the user plane in a multi access management services (MAMS) framework that can be used to flexibly select the combination of uplink and downlink access and core network paths, and user plane treatment for improving network efficiency and enhanced application quality of experience.</t></abstract>
