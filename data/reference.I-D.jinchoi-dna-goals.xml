<abstract><t>Upon establishing a new link-layer connection, a host may or may not have valid IP configuration for Internet Connectivity. A host may determine whether its IP configuration is valid by checking Network Layer link change. With the information gathered, a host may decide if their own configuration needs to be updated and initiate a new configuration in case of link change. This procedure is described as Detecting Network Attachment.</t></abstract>
