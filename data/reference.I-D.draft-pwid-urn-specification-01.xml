<abstract><t>This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid' namespace identifier.  The purpose of the standard is to support general, global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic, persistent and precise web references for web materials.  The PWID URN can assist in two ways: First, by providing potential resolvable precise and persistent reference scheme for documents, which is not sufficiently covered by existing web reference practices.  Second, by providing a standardized way to specify web elements in a web collection also known as web corpus.  Definitions of web collections are often needed for extraction of data used in production of research results, e.g. for evaluations in the future. Current practices today are not persistent as they often use some CDX version, which vary for different implementations.</t></abstract>
