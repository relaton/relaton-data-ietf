<abstract><t>Various Internet protocols and applications require some mechanism for identifying relationships between Domain Name System (DNS) names. In this document we provide examples of protocols and applications for which knowledge of these relationships is useful, if not required.  Further we discuss the various types of domain name relationships, review current needs and solutions, and identify considerations for solution sets.</t></abstract>
