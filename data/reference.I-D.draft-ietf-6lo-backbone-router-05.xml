<abstract><t>This specification proposes proxy operations for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery on behalf of devices located on broadcast-inefficient wireless networks.  A broadcast-efficient backbone running classical IPv6 Neighbor Discovery federates multiple wireless links to form a large MultiLink Subnet, but the broadcast domain does not need to extend to the wireless links for the purpose of ND operation. Backbone Routers placed at the wireless edge of the backbone proxy the ND operation and route packets from/to registered nodes, and wireless nodes register or are proxy-registered to the Backbone Router to setup proxy services in a fashion that is essentially similar to a classical Layer-2 association.</t></abstract>
