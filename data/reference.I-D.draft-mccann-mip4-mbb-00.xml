<abstract><t>A make-before-break handoff is one where resources on a target system are allocated prior to releasing the resources on a source system. Make-before-break can be an effective means to provide a more seamless handoff with fewer dropped packets.  The existing Mobile IPv4 specification supports simultaneous bindings, which can facilitate a make-before-break handoff.  However, the binding state at the home agent is only one example of a resource that can be allocated; others include the link connection to the Foreign Agent (or access router) and the provision of security associations between the mobile node and the mobility agents.  It may be desirable to set up these resources on the target system without necessarily creating a binding entry on the Home Agent.  This document provides some additional conventions on the use of simultaneous bindings in a make- before-break handoff that can be used to optimize the allocation of resources in these scenarios.</t></abstract>
