<abstract><t>This memo specifies modifications required to DS-Lite and 6RD so that both IPv4/ IPv6 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4/ IPv6 servers.  The DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand element (B4) proxying IGMP and then tunneling IGMP messages to DS- Lite Address Family Transition Router element (AFTR).  IPv4 multicast data received at AFTR is tunneled to B$ and then delivered to the hosts.  IPv6 multicast and MLD can be supported in a similar way.  The 6RD protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6RD Customer Edge and then tunneling MLD messages to 6RD Border Relays where IPv6 multicast routing is supported.  Multicast data received at 6RD Border Relay is tunneled to 6RD Customer Edge node and then delivered to the hosts.  We show that IPv4 multicast and IGMP can be supported in a similar way.</t></abstract>
