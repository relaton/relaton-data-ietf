<abstract><t>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol [RFC7285] has defined several resources and services to provide clients with basic network information.  However, the base ALTO protocol and latest extensions only provide end-to-end metrics, which are insufficient to satisfy the demands of solving more complex network optimization problems.  This document introduces an extension to the base ALTO protocol, namely the path-vector extension, which allows ALTO clients to query information such as capacity regions for a given set of flows.  A non-normative example called multi-flow scheduling is presented to illustrate the limitations of existing ALTO (endpoint) cost maps.  After that, details of the extension are defined.</t></abstract>
