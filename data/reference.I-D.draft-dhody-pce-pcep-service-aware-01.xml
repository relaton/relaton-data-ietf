<abstract><t>In certain networks like financial information network (stock/ commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications, Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss is becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other constraints and metrics.  Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service providers.  [MPLS-SERVICE] describes MPLS architecture to allow latency, loss and jittering as properties.  [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with which network performance information is distributed via OSPF.  This document describes the extension to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency- Variation and Loss as constraints for end to end path computation.</t></abstract>
