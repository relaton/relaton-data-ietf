<abstract><t>This document presents an overview snapshot of the HRPC project to map engineering concepts at the protocol level that may be related to human rights, with a focus on the promotion and protection of the freedom of expression and of association.  It provides a framework while reporting on the study including: theoretical background, results and basic considerations.  It will reference the detailed work being done on terminlogy and case studies documented in the research draft.  It also folds in discussions from the research literature.  The documents, [HRPC-Research] and this document, form an interrelated set that may later be combined into a single document.  This draft is still in very early stages and welcomes further contribution.  Text is solicited.
