<abstract><t>A number of enhancements to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) have been proposed. Some have been implemented, and some are advancing toward standardization. It is likely that additional enhancements will be proposed in the future. At present there is no common mechanism for LDP speakers to activate such enhancements. Consequently, an enhancement specification typically includes an ad hoc procedure for activating it at session initialization time. This draft specifies a mechanism for activating enhancements that allows LDP speakers to enable enhancements at session establishment time as well as to to enable and disable them following session establishment.</t></abstract>
