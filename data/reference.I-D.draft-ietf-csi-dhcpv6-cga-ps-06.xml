<abstract><t>This document describes potential issues in the interaction between DHCPv6 and Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs). Firstly, the scenario of using CGAs in DHCPv6 environments is discussed. Some operations are clarified for the interaction of DHCPv6 servers and CGA-associated hosts. We then also discuss how CGAs and DHCPv6 may have mutual benefits for each other, including using CGAs in DHCPv6 operations to enhance its security features and using DHCPv6 to provide the CGA generation function.  As an informational document, this document aims to analyze the possible interactions between CGAs and DHCPv6 from the functional perspective. This document does NOT propose/define any concrete solutions. Whether these possibilities are going to be defined as solutions or standards in the future is out of scope.</t></abstract>
