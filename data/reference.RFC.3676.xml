<title>The Text/Plain Format and DelSp Parameters</title>
<author initials='R.' surname='Gellens' fullname='R. Gellens'><organization /></author>

<abstract><t>This specification establishes two parameters (Format and DelSP) to be used with the Text/Plain media type.  In the presence of these parameters, trailing whitespace is used to indicate flowed lines and a canonical quote indicator is used to indicate quoted lines.  This results in an encoding which appears as normal Text/Plain in older implementations, since it is in fact normal Text/Plain, yet provides for superior wrapping/flowing, and quoting.  This document supersedes the one specified in RFC 2646, &quot;The Text/Plain Format Parameter&quot;, and adds the DelSp parameter to accommodate languages/coded character sets in which ASCII spaces are not used or appear rarely.
