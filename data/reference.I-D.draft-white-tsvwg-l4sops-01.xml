<abstract><t>This draft is intended to provide guidance to operators of end- systems, operators of networks, and researchers in order to ensure successful deployment of L4S in the Internet.  It includes mechanisms that are intended to promote reasonable fairness between L4S and Classic flows sharing a single-queue [RFC3168] bottleneck link.  This draft identifies opportunites to prevent and/or detect and resolve fairness problems in such networks.</t></abstract>
