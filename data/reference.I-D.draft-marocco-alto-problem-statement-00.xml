<abstract><t>A significant part of the Internet traffic today is generated by peer-to-peer applications used for file sharing, realtime communications and live media streaming.  Such applications often deal with large amounts of data in direct peer-to-peer connections, but they usually have little knowledge of the underlying topology, both at the overlay layer and the network layer.  As a result, they may choose their peers based on measurements and statistics which, in some specific situations, often lead to suboptimal choices.  This document describes problems related to optimizing traffic generated by peer-to-peer applications through the use of link and network layer information.</t></abstract>
